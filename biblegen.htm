<B>I. General Information About the Text</B> 
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B>A. Old Testament</B> 
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Old Testament is written mostly in Hebrew, except for the
following sections which are written in Aramaic (constituting
about one percent of the Old Testament): Genesis 31:47 (two words),
Jeremiah 10:11, Ezra 4:8-6:18; 7:12-26, and Daniel 2:4b-7:28.
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B>1. The languages of the Old Testament</B> 
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B>a. Introduction</B> 
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Semitic family of languages do not include the oldest known
languages -- that honor goes to Sumerian, a unique language which
is part of no known language family and bears no resemblance to
any other known language; it was written with cuneiform characters.
The earliest evidence for Semitic tongues are Akkadian texts dating
back into the third millennium B.C. Semitic is distantly related
to the Hamitic family of languages, which includes Egyptian, and
so in its earliest roots, the two are combined into what is called
Hamito-semitic. At a point in prehistory, they split into what
is called proto- Semitic and proto-Hamitic. From these, arise
Egyptian in the Hamitic branch, and on the Semitic side, the northwest
Semitic languages of Ugaritic, Moabite, Aramaic and Hebrew and
the Southeast Semitic languages such as Akkadian (divisible into
two dialects, Babylonian and Assyrian). The earlier Semitic languages,
such as Akkadian and Ugaritic have a case system which identifies
what role a noun is playing in a sentence. That is, a &quot;U&quot;
tacked on to the end of the word, as in <I>Shar</I>, the Babylonian
word for prince, gives the form <I>Sharu</I>, telling the reader
that the word is the subject of the sentence, as in &quot;The
Prince hears the Princess&quot;. An &quot;A&quot; tacked on to
the end -- <I>Shara</I> -- makes the word the object, as in &quot;the
Princess hears the Prince.&quot; And an &quot;I&quot; tacked on
at the end as in <I>Shari</I> makes the word possessive, as in
&quot;the Prince of the Princess&quot;.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In later Semitic languages such as Hebrew, the case system has
disappeared, so that word order now indicates the job assignments
that were previously provided by the case endings. Hebrew is one
of the latest of the known Semitic languages. Even Arabic, another
Semitic language, appears more ancient in its forms, since it
preserves the old Semitic case structure.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The different Semitic languages bear a general similarity with
each other, as for instance with the word for &quot;sun&quot;.
In Akkadian it is <I>shamash</I>, in Arabic it is <I>shamps</I>
and in Hebrew it is <I>shemesh</I>.
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B>b. Hebrew</B> 
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hebrew was the language of the northern and southern kingdoms
of Israel and Judah respectively. It was used by the Jews until
the time of the Babylonian captivity, when the language of the
court, Aramaic, came more and more to replace it. When the Jewish
people returned from the Babylonian captivity around 536 B.C.
the Hebrew language had undergone some significant changes. Aramaic
words had been added to the vocabulary, and the alphabet was changed
from the Old Hebrew characters to the newer square Aramaic script
-- which is the form still in use today. After the fall of Jerusalem
AD 70 and the subsequent dispersion, Hebrew, already barely more
than a liturgical language (used in the Synagogue for reading
scripture), ceased to be spoken altogether. Hebrew remained a
dead language, known only to scholars until the end of the nineteenth
century. With the rise of the Zionist movement in Europe, some
Jews started to revive Hebrew as a spoken tongue, so those Jews
who moved back into Palestine began speaking to one another in
the old Biblical language. Today, the official language of the
modern nation of Israel is Hebrew and except for the addition
of a few new words to account for technological change -- like
airplane and automobile and the like -- the Modern Hebrew language
is virtually identical to that of the Bible.
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B>c. Aramaic</B> 
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Aramaic, not to be confused with the language spoken by the Arabs
today -- which is called Arabic -- is a Semitic language used
by the neo- Babylonians of the time of Nebuchadnezzar II (cf.
Book of Daniel). It became the major language of the ancient Near
East and was spoken and written by most nations of the area until
the rise of Islam subjugated it and replaced it with Arabic.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The language most commonly spoken in Israel in Jesus' day was
Aramaic and in fact it is the language that Jesus himself spoke.
A few snatches are recorded in the New Testament, but most of
what remains are translations of his words into Greek, the language
used by the New Testament writers. They used Greek because it
was the language of the Roman Empire and the writers of the New
Testament were concerned that the message of the gospel should
get as wide a readership as possible. The translational nature
of Christ's words can be seen, for example, in the wording of
the beatitudes; Luke writes simply &quot;blessed are the poor&quot;,
while Matthew writes &quot;blessed are the poor in spirit&quot;.
The reason for the slight difference in the wording results from
the underlying Aramaic word for &quot;poor&quot;, which has both
ideas contained within it; Matthew, therefore, was a bit more
precise in his translation, since the Greek word for poor generally
-- like the English term -- refers only to those who lack material
benefits.
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B>B. New Testament</B> 
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The New Testament is written entirely in Greek, except, as has
already been indicated, for a few Aramaic words or phrases: Matthew
27:33, Matthew 27:46, Mark 5:41, Mark 15:22, Mark 15:34, and John
19:17.
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B>1. Greek</B> 
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Though the native language of the Romans was Latin, the language
of the Empire, and especially the eastern half of the empire where
the Jews lived, was Greek; the Greeks, though militarily weak,
had been culturally powerful, leaving their mark on Roman thinking
in everything from their language and theology, to their laws
and philosophy. If a person knew Greek, he could get along well
in the Roman Empire, just as today, if a person knows English,
he'll do better than a person who doesn't.
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B>2. The Manuscripts of the Bible</B> 
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For the Old Testament, the traditional text is what is known as
the Masoretic. The Masoretes were Jewish scholars who worked diligently
between the 6th and 10th centuries A.D. in Babylonia and Palestine
to reproduce, as far as possible, the original text of the Old
Testament. Their intention was not to interpret the Bible, but
to transmit to future generations what they regarded as the authentic
text. Therefore, to this end, they gathered manuscripts and whatever
oral traditions were available to them.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They were careful to draw attention to any peculiarities they
found in the spellings of words or the grammar of sentences in
the Old Testament, and since Hebrew in their day was a dying language,
they introduced a series of vowel signs to insure the correct
pronunciation of the text, since traditionally, the text was written
with consonants only. Among the various systems developed to represent
the vowel sounds, the system developed in the city of Tiberias,
on the shore of the Sea of Galilee, gained the ascendancy.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The earliest complete copy of the Masoretic text of the Old Testament
is located in the St. Petersburg (formerly Leningrad) Public Library;
it was written about 1008 A.D.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Masoretic text is not a single, unbroken thread, but rather
a river of manuscripts, with both a western and eastern branch;
within the texts labeled &quot;Masoretic&quot; there is a certain
amount of variation and the Masoretes carefully noted the differences
in the texts that they used as their sources. Therefore, it must
be stressed that the so-called &quot;Textus Receptus&quot; that
one may hear of occasionally (especially from those who believe
that the King James Version is the only acceptable translation)
is mostly a pious fiction; it is a concept that has little basis
in reality beyond wishful thinking.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Remember, too, that English is not the only language that the
Bible has been translated into. It has been translated into over
two thousand languages by scholars using the original Greek and
Hebrew texts.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The earliest copies of Old Testament books are called the Dead
Sea Scrolls, a body of biblical manuscripts discovered since 1947
inside caves near a place called Qumran, right next to the Dead
Sea in Israel. The texts all date prior to 70 A.D., the period
when the community at Qumran was destroyed by the Romans following
the Jewish revolt. Some texts date as far back as 150- 200 B.C.,
based on epigraphic dating and Carbon 14 dating.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Other manuscripts useful for establishing the text of the Old
Testament are as follows:<p>
<UL>
<LI>The Septuagint -- a translation of the Old Testament into
Greek, made in Alexandria, Egypt about 250 B.C. There are several
versions, with minor variations among them. They are: the Codex
Sinaiticus, which dates to the fourth century A.D., the Codex
Alexandrinus, which dates to the fifth century A.D, and the Codex
Vaticanus, also of the fourth century A.D.
<LI>The Samaritan Pentateuch. A copy of the first five books of
Moses kept by the Samaritans in Samaritan characters. It is notorious
for some deliberate alterations designed to legitimize the Samaritan
place of worship on Mt. Gerizim (cf. John 4:20).
<LI>Peshitta. The Syriac translation of the Old and New Testaments.
Syriac is an Aramaic dialect. The translation was done sometime
between 75 and 200 A.D.
<LI>Vulgate. The Latin translation of the Old and New Testaments
that was made by Jerome about 400 A.D.II.
</UL>

<P>
<B>II. The Nature of Translation</B> 
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B>A. How translation occurs</B> 
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It is important to realize -- and most people who have not learned
a second language wouldn't know -- that there is no such thing
as a one-to-one correspondence between languages. You cannot have
a word for word translation that is at all readable, because the
word order is different, the nature of the grammar is different
and even the sense of a word may cover a wider or smaller range
than the corresponding English word.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For instance, the word &quot;house&quot; in Hebrew can mean &quot;immediate
family&quot; or &quot;a royal dynasty&quot; besides the equivalent
English idea of a building where a person dwells. Therefore to
have an accurate English translation you cannot simply translate
the Hebrew word with &quot;house&quot;; you need to translate
it according to which of the possible meanings is intended.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Idioms, likewise, do not translate across directly: for instance
the English phrase &quot;I'm sick and tired of apple pie&quot;
if translated literally could give a reader in another language
the false impression that the individual in question is sleepy
and ready to throw up.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Consider the following &quot;literal translation&quot; of the
first verse of the Bible, which maintains the Hebrew word order
and phrasing and ask yourself if it is easily comprehensible:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
In-beginning he-created God (definite direct object) the-heavens
and-(definite direct object) the-earth.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But even this is not entirely accurate in a word for word sense,
because Hebrew does not have a true past tense; however, there
is no other way to indicate perfect aspect (completed action).
However, when one of the prophets makes use of the perfect aspect
to show the certainty of the prophesy, to translate it as a past
tense can create the false impression that the prophet is speaking
of things that have already happened when that is not the case
at all! And in front of the single words (they are only one word
in Hebrew) &quot;the-heavens&quot; and &quot;the-earth&quot; is
the Hebrew word that indicates that what follows is a definite
direct object, as you can see, hardly translatable into English
at all.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Having said all this, one would imagine that this first verse
is a complicated sentence. Not at all. It is remarkably simple.
It only becomes difficult if we expect translation to be &quot;literal&quot;.
It isn't. All translation, by its very nature, is paraphrastic
and interpretive.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The way translation happens is as follows. The translator learns
a foreign language and learns it well. Learning Hebrew or Greek
is just like learning French or Spanish in high school. There
is nothing mysterious or special about the ancient languages.
Then the translator reads the foreign text and understands it.
Having understood it, he or she then puts it into the best English
possible.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There is no mystery associated with the translation of the Bible,
nor are there any significant disagreements between translations.
However, by the nature of what translation is -- the work of individuals
with their own separate styles -- the wording of say, Today's
English Version is not going to be identical to the King James
Version or the New International Version. Not because anyone is
trying to twist something or make it say what it doesn't, but
only because each translator is going to word it as he thinks
best. But the MEANING will be the same. And of course between
the King James and the more modern translations there is also
the gap caused by the change in the English language -- we don't
speak like the people in Shakespeare's time did, but their way
of speaking is no &quot;grander&quot; or any more &quot;eloquent&quot;
than ours. King James English was the way any farmer or fisherman
of 1611 would have talked, just as Today's English Version or
the New International Version is the way an average person speaks
today. For all the snobbishness of attitude on the part of some
regarding Shakespeare today, in his own day he was considered
somewhat vulgar and not a little risque. Shakespeare was like
an ordinary television drama or sitcom is for us today.
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B>B. Textual criticism</B> 
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One other change since the time of the King James translation,
of course, is the improvement in the texts that are available
to today's translators. They are older and that much closer to
the original; moreover, the methods of textual criticism -- the
science of comparing the different and sometimes inconsistent
manuscripts and determining which one is the closest to the original
reading -- have advanced considerably since the 1600's.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The history of the biblical texts shows clearly that all of them
stand far removed from the originals both by time and by the process
of transmission. They contain not only scribal errors, but even
some actual transformations of the text, both deliberate and accidental.
By means of textual criticism we attempt to find all the alterations
that have occurred and then recover the earliest possible form
of the text.
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B>1. Methods</B> 
<P>
Textual criticism proceeds in three steps:<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
a. All the variant readings of the text are collected and arranged.
Of course, this is the very reason textual criticism is necessary
at all. If we had only a single copy, there would be no questions,
but since we have several, which all say different things, we
have a problem. Which text accurately records the original statements?
<br>
b. The variants must then be examined.
<br>
c. The most likely reading is then determined. For the Old Testament,
in order to carry out these steps, it is necessary to use the
Masoretic Text, which ordinarily serves as the basis from which
the textual critic will work. Combined with the Masoretic Text
the critic will consult all the ancient Hebrew manuscripts and
versions that might be available.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B>2. The most important Hebrew manuscripts for Old Testament
textual criticism are:</B> <p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
a. The St. Petersburg (or Leningrad) Codex, 1008 A.D. It is the
largest and only complete manuscript of the entire Old Testament.
<br>
b. The Aleppo Codex, 930 A.D. It used to be a complete copy of
the Old Testament, but was partially destroyed in a synagogue
fire in 1948.
<br>
c. The British Museum Codex, 950 A.D. It is an incomplete copy
of the Pentateuch.
<br>
d. The Cairo Codex, 895 A.D. A copy of the Former and Latter Prophets
(Joshua, Judges, 1 and 2 Samuel, 1 and 2 Kings, Isaiah, Jeremiah,
Ezekiel, and the twelve minor prophets).
<br>
e. The Leningrad (St. Petersburg) Codex of the Prophets, 916 A.D.
containing only the Latter Prophets.
<br>
f. The Reuchlin Codex of the Prophets, 1105 A.D.
<br>
g. Cairo Geniza fragments, 6th to 9th century, A.D. h. Qumran
Manuscripts (the Dead Sea Scrolls), 200 B.C - 70 A.D.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B>3. The most important ancient translations of the Old Testament
into languages other than Hebrew are:</B> <p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
a. The Septuagint (several versions)
<br>
b. The Aramaic Targums (several versions)
<br>
c. The Syriac Peshitta
<br>
d. The Samaritan Pentateuch
<br>
e. The Latin Vulgate
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B>4. Ideally, the work of textual criticism should proceed with
all of these ancient versions and copies readily available. There
are then some basic rules that help place the textual criticism
of the Bible, whether Old or New Testament, on a firm basis that
generally avoids arbitrariness and subjectivity.</B> <p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
a. For the Old Testament, where the Hebrew manuscripts and the
ancient versions agree, we may assume that the original reading
has been preserved. Likewise, with the New Testament, where the
various manuscripts agree, we may assume the original text has
been preserved. To our great relief, this covers 95 per cent of
the Bible.
<br>
b. Where the manuscripts differ among themselves, one should chose
either the more difficult reading from the point of view of language
and subject matter or the reading that most readily makes the
development of the other readings intelligible. In order to make
this choice, it is necessary that the critic have a thorough knowledge
of the history and character of the various manuscripts. It needs
also to be realized that these criteria work together and complement
one another. A &quot;more difficult reading&quot; does not mean
a &quot;meaningless reading.&quot;
<br>
c. However, the critic must not assume that just because a reading
appears meaningless that it necessarily is. Scribes are not likely
to turn a meaningful passage into gibberish. Therefore, if a passage
is not understandable, that is often as far as we can go. We must,
as scholars, acknowledge our own ignorance.
<br>
d. With the Old Testament, where the Hebrew manuscripts and the
translations differ, and a superior reading cannot be demonstrated
on the basis of the above rules, then one should, as a matter
of first principle, allow the Hebrew text to stand. With the New
Testament, one will generally choose the shorter reading because
of the tendency of scribes to try to &quot;explain&quot; passages.
<br>
e. Where the different manuscripts differ and none of them seem
to make any sense, one may attempt a conjecture concerning the
true reading -- a conjecture that must be validated by demonstrating
the process of the textual corruption that would have lead to
the existing text forms. Such a conjecture, however, must not
be used to validate the interpretation of a whole passage in that
it might have been made on the basis of an expectation derived
from the whole.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B>5. The Causes of Textual Corruption</B> 
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The goal of textual criticism is to remove the textual errors
and restore the original readings. To aid in this goal, it is
helpful if the textual critic has an idea of what sorts of errors
he or she is likely to find.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When copying out a text, errors occur in every conceivable way,
as we no doubt know from our own experiences. Sometimes it is
difficult to explain, even to ourselves, how we might have come
to make a particular error. Therefore it is unlikely that we will
be able to correct or explain everything that has eluded the scribes
over the centuries. A reading that appears doubtful or corrupt
to us today may have been caused by a hole or some other damage
to the copyist's manuscript. Or maybe the letters or words in
a given section of his text were faded and nearly illegible, forcing
the copyist to make his best guess. Moreover, a single error can
give rise to many others, leaving us with no clue as to how it
might have happened.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And of course, as always, the assumption of a textual error may
really be only a cover for our failure to understand the language
or the idiom.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Beyond these unrecoverable sorts of errors, there are two categories
of errors that may be distinguished and often corrected: errors
due to an unintentional, mechanical lapse on the part of the copyist
(often called Errors of Reading and Writing), and two, errors
that are the result of deliberate alteration (called Intentional
Alterations).
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B>a. Errors of Reading and Writing</B> 
<P><blockquote>
1. Confusion of similar letters In Hebrew, there are several letters
which look very similar to one another: the B and K, R and D,
H and T, W and Y.
<br>
2. Transposition of Letters
<br>
3. Haplography -- a fancy word that means when there were two
or more identical or similar letters, groups of letters, or words
all in sequence, one of them gets omitted by error. Of course,
there is some evidence that some of these supposed &quot;errors&quot;
are actually equivalent to English contractions like &quot;don't&quot;
instead of &quot;do not&quot; and therefore are not errors at
all.
<br>
4. Dittography -- another fancy word that refers to an error caused
by repeating a letter, group of letters , a word or a group of
words. The opposite, really, of Haplography.
<br>
5. Homoioteleuton -- an even fancier word which refers to the
error that occurs when two words are identical, or similar in
form, or have similar endings and are close to each other. It
is easy in this sort of situation for the eye of the copyist to
skip from one word to the other, leaving out everything in between.
A good example of this occurs in 1 Samuel 14:41:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Therefore Saul said unto the Lord God of <B>Israel</B>, give a
perfect lot. (KJV)
<p>
Therefore Saul said, &quot;O Lord God of <B>Israel</B>, why hast
thou not answered thy servant this day? If this guilt is in me
or in Jonathan my son, O Lord, God of Israel, give Urim: but if
this guilt is in thy people <B>Israel</B>, give Thummim. (RSV)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The copyist's eye jumped from the first instance of the word &quot;Israel&quot;
to the last instance, leaving out everything in between for the
reading that the KJV translators had at their disposal. The word
translated &quot;perfect&quot; is spelled with the same consonants
in Hebrew (TH-M-M) as the word Thummim.
<p>
6. Errors of Joining and Dividing Words.
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This is more a problem in the New Testament than it is in the
Old Testament, for while the Greek manuscripts were written well
into the Medieval period without spacing or dividing signs between
words, there is no evidence that this was EVER the case with the
Old Testament Hebrew texts. In fact, the evidence is very strong
to the contrary; inscriptions on walls from the time of Hezekiah
actually had dots between each word to separate them from each
other.</blockquote>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B>b. Deliberate Alterations</B> 
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Samaritan Pentateuch, as an example, is notorious for its
purposeful changes designed to help legitimize some of their sectarian
biases. They were sort of like the Jehovah's witnesses of their
day.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A more substantive change in the Hebrew text came after the Babylonian
captivity in the time of Ezra (fifth century BC) when the alphabet
changed from the Old Hebrew Script to the Aramaic Square Script
-- in which all copies of the Old Testament except for the Samaritan
Pentateuch are written.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It should not surprise us that there have been a certain amount
of alteration in the text over time, since the Bible was not intended
to be the object of scholarly study but rather was to be read
by the whole believing community as God's word to them. Thus,
the text would undergo adaptations to fit the linguistic needs
of the community. For instance in Isaiah 39:1 the Masoretic Text
preserves a rare word, <I>hazaq</I>, which has the sense of &quot;to
get well, recuperate.&quot; The community that produced the Dead
Sea scrolls altered this word to the more common Hebrew word for
get well, <I>zayah</I>. Other examples of adaptation to colloquial
usage are likely. The lack of early material for the Old Testament
makes it impossible to demonstrate these sorts of alterations
on a larger scale. But a few small alterations are easily demonstrable.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The treatment of the divine name Baal is an example of deliberate
change for theological reasons. In personal names which included
the word &quot;Baal&quot;, which simply means &quot;master&quot;
or &quot;lord&quot;, the scribes deliberately replaced &quot;Baal&quot;
with &quot;Bosheth,&quot; which means &quot;shame&quot;. Hence,
Jonathan's son was actually named &quot;Meribbaal&quot; rather
than &quot;Mephibosheth&quot; (cf. 1 Chron. 8:34, 9:30 and 2 Sam
9:6, 19:24, 21:7)
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Another example of deliberate alteration is found in Job 1:5,
11 and 2:5, 9 where we now read the word berek, to bless (with
God as the object) even though we should expect to find the word
qalal, to curse. The scribes replaced the offensive expression
&quot;to curse God&quot; with a euphemism -- motivated no doubt
by their fear of taking God's name in vain.

<B>III. A History of English Bible Translation</B> 
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The first English translation of the Bible was undertaken by John
Wycliffe (1320-1384). By 1380 he had finished the translation
of the New Testament, however his translation of the Old Testament
was incomplete at the time of his death. Friends and students
completed the task after his death. His translation was not from
the original Greek and Hebrew texts; instead he made use of the
Latin Vulgate. Many translations followed:
<UL>
<LI>William Tyndale's translation of the Bible again relied heavily
on the Vulgate; however, he was a good Greek scholar and so he
did make use of Erasmus' Greek text and some other helps that
had been unavailable to Wycliffe. The New Testament was completed
in 1525 and the Pentateuch in 1530. He was martyred before he
could complete the Old Testament.
<LI>Miles Coverdale, a friend of Tyndale, prepared and published
a Bible dedicated to Henry VIII in 1535. The New Testament is
based largely on Tyndale's version.
<LI>Matthew's Bible appeared in 1537 and its authorship is somewhat
unclear; it is probable that it was produced by John Rogers, a
friend of Tyndale. Apparently Rogers came into possession of Tyndale's
unpublished translations of the historical books of the Old Testament
and so included these in this version, which again, rests heavily
on the work of Tyndale, as well as Coverdale.
<LI>The Great Bible of 1539 was based on the Tyndale, Coverdale
and Matthew's Bibles. It was a large volume, chained to the reading
desk in churches, and from this fact derives its name.
<LI>The Geneva Bible of 1560 was produced by scholars who fled
to Geneva, Switzerland from England during the persecution instigated
by Queen Mary. It was a revision of the Great Bible.
<LI>The Bishops' Bible of 1568 was produced under the direction
of the Archbishop of Canterbury during the reign of Elizabeth
I. It is to a large extent simply a revision of the Great Bible,
with some influence of the Geneva Bible. It was used chiefly by
the clergy and was unpopular with the average person.
<LI>The Douay Bible was a Roman Catholic version translated from
the Latin Vulgate. The New Testament was published at Rheims in
1582 and the Old Testament at Douay in 1609-1610. It contains
controversial notes and until recently was the generally accepted
English version for the Catholic Church.
<LI>The King James (or Authorized) Version was published in 1611.
It was produced by forty-seven scholars under the authorization
of King James I of England. The Bishops' Bible served as the basis
for this version, though they did study the Greek and Hebrew texts
and consulted other English translations. It was the most popular
translation in English for well over three hundred years, undergoing
at least three revisions before 1800. The New King James Version
appeared in 1982. The New Testament had been published in 1979.
One hundred nineteen scholars worked on the project, sponsored
by the International Trust for Bible Studies and Thomas Nelson
Publishers. They sought to preserve and improve the 1611 version.
<LI>The Revised Version was published between 1881 and 1885. It
was made by a group of English and American scholars. It was to
a large extent a revision of the King James translation, though
the scholars involved did check the most ancient copies of the
original scriptures using manuscripts that were unavailable at
the time the King James Version was produced.
<LI>The American Standard Version of 1900-1901 is the American
version of the Revised Version, with those renderings preferred
by the American members of the Revision Committee of 1881-1885.
<LI>The Revised Standard Version was published in 1952. In 1928
the copyright of the American Standard Version was acquired by
the International Council of Religious Education, which authorized
a revision by a committee of thirty-two scholars. The New Testament
was issued in 1946, the complete Bible in 1952. The copyright
is currently owned by the Division of Education of the National
Council of Churches of Christ in the United States of America.
The Revised Standard Version Bible Committee is a continuing body,
which is both ecumenical and international, with active Protestant
and Catholic members from Great Britain, Canada, and the United
States. Additional revisions were made in the New Testament in
1971 and in 1990 the New Revised Standard Version was issued.
<LI>The Berkeley Version was published in 1959. The New Testament
was originally translated into modern English by a single individual,
Gerrit Verkuyl in 1945. With a staff of twenty translators, including
professors from various Christian colleges and seminaries, all
under his direction, a translation of the Old Testament was rendered.
<LI>The Amplified Bible appeared in 1965. It was commissioned
by the Lockman Foundation and is unusual -- even idiosyncratic
-- in that it has bracketed explanatory words to try to explain
somewhat difficult passages.
<LI>The Jerusalem Bible was published in 1966. It is a Roman Catholic
work originally done in French at the Dominican Biblical School
in Jerusalem in 1956. The French title was La Bible de Jerusalem.
The English version was translated from the original Hebrew and
Greek texts, but it follows the French version on most matters
of interpretation. It is the only major English translation that
makes use of the divine name &quot;Yahweh&quot; in the Old Testament.
The translation includes the Apocrypha. A revision called The
New Jerusalem Bible came out in 1989.
<LI>The New English Bible was published in 1970. It was produced
by a joint committee of Bible scholars from leading denominations
in England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland, assisted by the university
presses of Oxford and Cambridge. Twenty-two years were spent in
the work of translation, with the New Testament arriving in 1961.
The full Bible includes the Apocrypha. It is printed in paragraphed,
single-column format, with verse numbers along the outside margin
of the pages. A revision of this translation, called the Revised
English Bible appeared in 1989.
<LI>The New American Standard Bible was published in 1971. It
is a revision of the American Standard Version and was commissioned
by the Lockman Foundation. A group of Bible scholars worked for
ten years, translating from the original texts and attempting
to render the grammar and terminology of the American Standard
Version into more contemporary English, except when God is addressed.
Then it reverts to archaic, King James style language. The New
Testament appeared in 1963.
<LI>The Living Bible appeared in 1971. It is a paraphrase by Kenneth
N. Taylor; he sought to express what the writers of scripture
meant in the simplest modern English possible. It is a paraphrase
of the American Standard Version; it is not a translation from
the original languages.
<LI>Today's English Version (Good News Bible) was published in
1976. The New Testament, entitled Good News For Modern Man was
published in 1966 by the American Bible Society. A translation
committee of Bible scholars was appointed to work with the United
Bible Societies to make a similar translation of the Old Testament.
Their objective was to provide a faithful translation into natural,
clear, and simple contemporary English. American and British editions
of the complete Bible appeared in 1976. In 1995 an updated version
was produced, called the Contemporary English Version, which is
notable for removing anything that might be misunderstood as anti-semitic
from its translation of the New Testament.
<LI>The New International Version was published in 1978. The Committee
enlisted Bible scholars from a broad range of denominations and
countries and has become the most widely used of the modern translations.

<B>IV. The Apocrypha</B> 
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The term &quot;Apocrypha&quot; comes from Greek and means &quot;hidden
things&quot;. It is used in three different ways: one, for writings
that were regarded as so important and precious that they must
be hidden from the general public and preserved for initiates,
the inner circle of believers. Two, it was applied to writings
which were hidden not because they were too good, but because
they were not good enough: because they were secondary, questionable,
or heretical. And finally third, apocrypha was applied to those
books which existed outside the Hebrew canon -- that is, books
of religious materials that the Jewish people did not accept as
scripture but which appeared in the Greek and Latin translations
of the Old Testament.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It is for this reason, that the books of the apocrypha have not
been accepted as scripture outside of Roman Catholic circles.
Within Roman Catholicism, with the exception of the First and
Second Books of Esdras and the Prayer of Manasseh, the Roman Church
accepts these writings as part of the Old Testament and designates
them as deuterocanonical, that is, added later to the canon.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Below is a list and summary of each of the books and parts of
books included in the apocrypha (it is interesting to note that
these books appeared in the original edition of the King James
Version of the Bible):
<P><blockquote>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b><i>1 Esdras.</i></b> It gives a parallel account of the events recorded in
Chronicles, Ezra and Nehemiah, with one large addition called
&quot;The Debate of the Three Youths&quot;. It is an adaptation
of a Persian story. In the story, Zerubbabel, the guardsman of
Darius wins a debate with two other young men over who the strongest
power might be: wine, the king, or, as Zerubbabel said &quot;women
are strongest, but truth conquers all.&quot; By winning this debate,
Zerubbabel is able to remind Darius of his obligation to allow
the rebuilding of the temple.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b><i>2 Esdras.</i></b> It is an expansion by Christian writers of an original
Jewish apocalyptic work. It consists of seven visions:<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
1. The seer demands an explanation for the suffering of Zion,
whose sin is not greater than that of her oppressor. The angel
Uriel answers that it cannot be understood, but that the era soon
to come will bring salvation.
<br>
2. The seer wants to know why Israel, God's chosen, has been delivered
up to other nations. The answer again is that it is incomprehensible
to men, but good times are coming.
<br>
3. The seer asks why the Jews do not possess the earth. The answer
given is that they will inherit it in an age to come. There is
also some discussion about the after life.
<br>
4. A mourning woman recounts her woes and is thereupon transformed
into a glorious city, a symbol of Jerusalem.
<br>
5. A twelve-winged and three-headed eagle, the symbol of Rome
which the interpreting angel identifies as the fourth beast of
Daniel chapter seven will be supplanted by the Messiah.
<br>
6. A man arises from the sea, annihilating an antagonistic multitude;
it is an adaptation based on the Son of man vision in Daniel 7.
<br>
7. The topic is Ezra's supposed restoration of the sacred books
of the Hebrew Bible by means of a vision and the help of supernaturally
guided scribes.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b><i>Tobit.</i></b> It is a pious short story about a righteous Hebrew of the
northern kingdom of Israel taken into captivity. Tobit suffers
persecution because he helps his fellow Israelites under the tyranny
of Esarhaddon. He is blinded accidentally and to his shame, his
wife must support him. He prays that he may die. At the same time,
a prayer is offered in Ecbatana by a young Jewish woman named
Sarah who is being haunted by a demon named Asmodaeus, who has
slain seven of her husbands on their wedding night. The angel
Raphael is sent &quot;to heal them both&quot;. Tobit sends his
son Tobias to collect ten silver talents left in Media. Raphael
takes the form of Azariah, who is hired as his traveling companion.
In the Tigris a fish is caught, and its heart, liver, and gall
are preserved by Tobias on Azariah's recommendation. Tobias arrives
in Ecbatana and becomes engaged to Sarah, who he comes to find
out is his cousin. On their wedding night, he burns the heart
and liver of the fish and the stench drives the demon away to
Egypt. Preceded by his dog, Tobias returns home (where his father
had given up on him as lost). Tobias takes the fish gall and anoints
his father's eyes, thereby restoring his sight.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b><i>Judith.</i></b> This tells the story of a young Jewish woman who was a
widow. She is a native of Bethulia which is being besieged by
the general Holofernes. She visits him in his camp, under the
ruse of revealing military secrets. Once with him, she begins
to entice him with her charms, until, while banqueting alone with
him, she is able to cut off his head. She then returns to Bethulia
with his head and is greeted by great rejoicing. The Assyrians
then retreat from the city after discovering that their general
had been killed. Judith and the other women of the city then rejoice
with a psalm of praise before God.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b><i>Additions to Daniel.</i></b> Several stories appear in the Greek translation of the book of
Daniel that are not present in the original text. These stories
are as follows:
<p><blockquote>
<b><i>The Prayer of Azariah</i></b> -- this is uttered while he is in the fiery
furnace in chapter three of Daniel. (Remember, Azariah is the
original Hebrew name of the man whom Nebuchadnezzar called Abednego.)
<br>
<b><i>The Song of the Three Holy Children</i></b> -- this is sung to God's praise
as the three walk around in the fire.
<br>
<b><i>Susanna</i></b> -- Susanna is the beautiful and virtuous wife of a wealthy
Jew in Babylon. Two elders of the people who lust after her come
upon her while she is taking a bath and offer her the alternative
of either letting them have sex with her or facing an accusation
of being an adulteress.. She chooses the latter. The two men who
have accused her are believed by everyone and she is condemned
to death, though she protests her innocence. Daniel cries out
against the injustice of this and in a second trial before him,
the lie is uncovered and the woman is justified.
<br>
<b><i>Bel and the Dragon</i></b> -- Daniel shows that the priests of Bel, and
not the image of the god, devours the nightly offerings of food
by scattering flour on the floor. In the morning, the footprints
of the priests are plainly visible, taking the food away. The
king of Babylon thereupon destroys the image.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then, Daniel destroys a mighty dragon that is worshipped by the
Babylonians. He is tossed into the lions den and is preserved
alive for six days. On the sixth day, the prophet Habakkuk is
miraculously transported to Babylon to provide Daniel with food.
On the seventh day he is released by the king.</blockquote>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b><i>Additions to Esther.</i></b> There are six additional passages in the
Greek version of the book.<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The first deals with Mordecai's dream and his prevention of a
conspiracy against the king.
<br>
The second is the king's edict for the destruction of all the
Jews in his realm.
<br>
The third are the prayers of Esther and Mordecai.
<br>
The fourth describes Esther's audience with the king.
<br>
The fifth is the king's edict permitting Jewish self-defense.
<br>
And the sixth includes the interpretation of Mordecai's dream.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b><i>The Prayer of Manasseh.</i></b> Claims to be the prayer which Manasseh
is recorded as praying in 2 Chronicles 33:11-19, a prayer of repentance.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b><i>The Epistle of Jeremiah.</i></b> Purports to be a letter written by Jeremiah
to the exiles in Babylon; the letter attacks idolatry.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b><i>The Book of Baruch.</i></b> It claims to be the work of the friend and
scribe of Jeremiah. In the setting of the Babylonian Exile of
597 BC, Baruch is depicted as addressing the exiles, setting out
a confession of sins, a prayer for forgiveness and a prayer for
salvation. Next, the book praises the Wisdom that may be found
in the law of Moses and without which the heathen have come to
nothing, but with which Israel can be saved. Finally, the book
ends with a lament of Jerusalem over the exiles, followed by an
exhortation to Jerusalem that she should be comforted, because
her children will some day come home.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b><i>Ecclesiasticus.</i></b> Also called the <b><i>Wisdom of Joshua (or Jesus) ben-Sira</i></b> 
(not to be confused with the book of Ecclesiastes in the Bible).
He was a Palestinian Jew living in Jerusalem; parts of the original
Hebrew text have been uncovered, though it is best known in the
Greek translation made by his grandson who furnishes chronological
details in a preface. The most likely date for Ben-Sira himself
is around 180 BC, since his grandson apparently migrated to Egypt
in the reign of Ptolemy VII Euergetes (170-117 BC).
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The book falls into two parts and fits the Ancient Near Eastern
literary classification called Wisdom Literature. The first half
of the book gives advice for a successful life conceived in the
widest sense: fear of the Lord and the observance of the Law are
allied in the author's experience and teaching with practical
wisdom drawn from observation and his own life. He argues that
personal piety will express itself in the observance of the law
in which Wisdom is revealed. In daily living, moderation will
be the keynote of all aspects of life.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The second half of the book concludes with a list praising the
famous men from Israel's history, ending with Simon II, the high
priest (c. 200 BC).
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b><i>The Wisdom of Solomon.</i></b> The book is an exhortation to seek wisdom,
and claims to have been composed by Solomon (it wasn't -- it dates
back to only about 200 BC). Chapters 1-5 declare the blessings
that will come to those who seek after Wisdom. Chapters 6-9 personify
Wisdom as a feminine celestial being, foremost of the creatures
and servants of God. Chapters 10-19 then conclude by reviewing
Old Testament history in the light of Wisdom: Wisdom has aided
the Jewish people throughout their history, and destroyed their
enemies.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b><i>1 Maccabees.</i></b> This book covers the events between 175 and 134 BC,
that is, the struggle of the Jews against Antiochus Epiphanes,
the wars of the Hasmonaeans, and the rule of John Hyrcanus. The
book ends with elaborate praise of John Hyrcanus, written just
after his death in 103 BC. The book describes the origin of the
Jewish Festival of Lights or the Feast of Dedication (see John
10:22 which records that Jesus celebrated this holiday) -- or
as it is more commonly known, Hanukkah.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b><i>2 Maccabees.</i></b> This book covers much of the same material as 1 Maccabees,
but it does not continue the history beyond the campaigns and
defeat of Nicanor. There are a number of discrepancies in chronological
and numerical matters between the books of 1 and 2 Maccabees.</blockquote>
