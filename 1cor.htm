<B>The Book of 1 Corinthians</B> 
<P>
<B>I. Title</B> 
<P>
The title of the book comes from the name of the city of Corinth,
in Greece, where the church the letter was addressed to was located.
It is the first of two letters that were written to the church
by Paul.
<P>
<B>II. Author and Setting</B> 
<ADDRESS>
A. Author
</ADDRESS>

<P>
The authors of the letter are Paul and Sosthenes; this is based
on the statement in 1 Corinthians 1:1-2a:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Paul, called to be an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God,
and our brother Sosthenes,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

B. Setting
</ADDRESS>

<P>
Corinth was located on the isthmus between Attica to the northeast
and the Greek Peloponnesus to the south; it controlled access
to two seas, the Aegean to the east and the Ionian on the west.
Its eastern port was called Cenchrea and was located on the Saronic
Gulf. Its western harbor was at Lechaeum on the Corinthian Gulf.
Because of its setting, Corinth was important both commercially
and strategically. It received shipping from all over the Roman
Empire; not surprising, it was considered to be a prosperous city.
<P>
It is estimated that at the peak of its prosperity, it had a free
population of about two hundred thousand, with another half million
slaves in its navy and its colonies.
<P>
The worship of Aphrodite (the counterpart of the Near Eastern
Astarte) was important in Corinth; such worship involved spending
time with the sacred prostitutes who inhabited her temple. The
city became notorious for its sexual immorality, to such an extent
that the city's name was used as an adjective to describe a &quot;loose&quot;
person.
<ADDRESS>
C. Date
</ADDRESS>

<P>
Obviously, the letter was written some time after he had first
visited the city (as recorded in Acts 18). Leaving Corinth in
the fall of AD 51, Paul went from Cenchrea toward Syria, by way
of Ephesus. Reaching Caesarea, he went to Jerusalem, then went
back to his home church in Antioch (Acts 18:18- 23).
<P>
After spending some time in Antioch, he departed on his third
missionary journey and visited Galatia and Phrygia (Acts 18:23).
From there, he finally went to Ephesus where he taught for about
three years (Acts 19:1- 20:31). According to 1 Corinthians 16:8-9,
20, it is clear that he wrote the letter while he was in Ephesus.
Based on the long time he spent there, and the fact that it followed
his time in Corinth, it is assumed that it was during the stay
in Ephesus recorded in Acts 19-20 that he wrote his first letter
to the Corinthian church. Therefore, Paul's first letter to the
Corinthians was probably written about AD 55.
