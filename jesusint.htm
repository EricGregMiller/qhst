1. The purpose of this course is to introduce the student to the
subject known as &quot;The Historical Jesus&quot;.
<P>
2. The course will involve a series of texts to read as well as
the lectures of the instructor.  To evaluate the course work of
the student, the instructor will assign a final exam at the end
of the course.
<P>
3. The texts for this course are:  <I>Gospel Truth: The New Image
of Jesus Emerging from Science and History, and Why it Matters</I>,
by Russell Shorto,  <I>Jesus</I>, by N.T. Wright,  <I>The Real
Jesus</I>, by Luke Timothy Johnson, and <I>The Historical Jesus</I>
by John Dominic Crossan, and <I>Jesus the Healer</I>, by Stevan
Davies.  Though this may seem to be a lot of reading, each of
these books is very significant; two represent what some term
a liberal approach and two represent a conservative approach,
and one which simply presents the facts and allows the reader
to decide for her or him self  thus giving the student both sides
of the issue.
