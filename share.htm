<h2><CENTER>What Does That Mean? <p></h2><h3> You can take any class you want, do all the work,
and you don't have to pay us a dime! </center></h3>

<P>
Of course, if you don't pay, then you won't get a grade, you won't
get any credit, and you won't get any technical help: that is,
we won't answer any questions you might have, and you won't get
any tests to check the progress of your education.
<P>
So, like shareware, if you like it, if it's useful, then why not
pay for it? It's the right thing to do.
<P>
<I>Registration and Cost</I> 
<P>
Registration and payment must be made to receive credit for a
course, though a course may be taken for free for no credit. To
register for the course, e-mail us your name and address.

<P>
We will respond with registration materials. Return them to us
with your check or money order made out to <B>Quartz Hill School
of Theology</B>. Courses are <B>U.S. $50.00</B> each, plus the
cost of books. <P>
<CENTER><b>Books may be ordered online at the <a href="amazon.htm">Campus Bookstore</a></b></CENTER><P>

<P>
After you register, you will be sent your tests; it will then
be your responsibility to find a proctor (someone to administer
and chaparone) the tests while you take them. This may be your
minister or some other professional, such as a school teacher.
<P>
<I>Credit</I> 
<P>
You can receive either CEUs (Continuing Education Units) or quarter
units if you register and pass a course. Quartz Hill School of
Theology is recognized by the Association of Christian Schools
International and is authorized to grant CEUs in Bible. <B>IMPORTANT: The school
is otherwise unaccredited, so there is no guarantee that other
institutions will accept our units. We recommend you discuss this
issue ahead of time with any other institutions to which you may
be planning on transferring.</B><P>
