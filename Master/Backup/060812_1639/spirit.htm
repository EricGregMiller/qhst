<P>
The function of the Holy Spirit in the New Testament age is well
known and several books have been written on the subject. Of more
significant import is what the Spirit's job may have been prior
to Pentecost. The only available book on the Holy Spirit in the
Old Testament was done in 1976 by Leon J. Wood. It was entitled
<I>The Holy Spirit in the Old Testament</I> and was published
by Zondervan. It is a useful book, but not without its faults.
Leon J. Wood writes:
<P>
<blockquote>The evidence that spiritual renewal, or regeneration, was true
of such Old Testament people lies mainly in two directions. One
is that these people lived in a way possible only for those who
had experienced regeneration, and the other is the avenue of logical
deduction that argues back from New Testament truth. For some
reason, the Old Testament itself does not speak of the matter
directly. Chafer is quite correct when he asserts: &quot;The Old
Testament will be searched in vain for record of Jews passing
from an unsaved to a saved state, or for any declaration about
the terms upon which such a change would be secured.&quot; Then,
because this is true, he states &quot;No positive declaration
can be made&quot; whether Old Testament people were regenerated
or not. Chafer's conclusion, however, is unwarranted in view of
the two lines of support mentioned....</blockquote>
<P>
<B>What Does the Holy Spirit Do?</B> 
<P>
Wood also writes that regeneration, indwelling, sealing, filling,
and empowering all occurred prior to Pentecost. He argues that
only the baptism of the Spirit, which made all believers one in
Christ, had yet to occur at Pentecost. I believe Wood's position
on these matters is unwarranted, and that Chafer in fact is closer
to the truth. I believe that the Spirit's primary activity in
the lives of Old Testament saints was to empower them for service.
The other activities, from baptism to indwelling had to await
the day of Pentecost. Wood's misunderstanding of the work of the
Spirit prior to Pentecost is related to his failure to consider
two critical New Testament passages, neither of which is mentioned
in his book:
<P>
<blockquote>While Apollos was at Corinth, Paul took the road through the interior
and arrived at Ephesus. There he found some disciples and asked
them, &quot;Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?&quot;
<P>
They answered, &quot;No, we have not even heard that there is
a Holy Spirit.&quot;
<P>
So Paul asked, &quot;Then what baptism did you receive?&quot;
<P>
&quot;John's baptism,&quot; they replied.
<P>
Paul said, &quot;John's baptism was a baptism of repentance. He
told the people to believe in the one coming after him, that is,
in Jesus.&quot; On hearing this, they were baptized into the name
of the Lord Jesus. When Paul placed his hands on them, the Holy
Spirit came on them, and they spoke in tongues and prophesied.
There were about twelve men in all (Acts 19:1-7)</blockquote>
<P>
This passage seems clearly to indicate that under the Old Covenant
the Holy Spirit was not behaving in the same way as afterward.
There had been no sealing, indwelling, or baptism of these disciples
of John, people who were truly redeemed believers in God. It was
not until Christianity was explained to them that the Holy Spirit
came.
<P>
The next passage, Acts 1:4-5, explicitly indicates that the coming
of the Holy Spirit was a new work. The disciples had to wait for
the Spirit to come:
<P>
<blockquote>On one occasion, while he was eating with them, he gave them this
command: &quot;Do not leave Jerusalem, but wait for the gift my
Father promised, which you have heard me speak about. For John
baptized with water, but in a few days you will be baptized with
the Holy Spirit.&quot;</blockquote>
<P>
That the baptizing and indwelling work of the Holy Spirit was
promised as something yet future would tend to indicate that this
activity was something which had not occurred before. Joel 2:28-32,
which Peter quoted in Acts 2:14-21, makes clear that something
new occurred with the coming of the Spirit. Peter claimed that
what had happened on the day of Pentecost. was the fulfillment
of an Old Testament promise. The reader should also look at the
description of the New Covenant as recorded in Jeremiah 31:31-34.
John 7:39 is also instructive on this point:
<P>
<blockquote>By this he meant the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were
later to receive. Up to that time the Spirit had not been given,
since Jesus had not yet been glorified.</blockquote>
<P>
So what did the Holy Spirit do in the Old Testament? Nine functions
(at least) can be listed.
<UL>
<LI>The Holy Spirit came upon people to empower them for specific
tasks (Judges 6:34; 1 Chron. 12:18; 2 Chron. 24:20).
<UL>
<LI>interpretation of dreams (Gen. 41:38, Dan. 5:11)
<LI>special skills (Ex. 31:1-7)
<LI>prophesy (1 Sam. 10:6, 2 Sam. 23:23, Ezekiel 11:5, 24, Joel
2:28-29)
</UL>

<LI>The Spirit of God was involved in creating the universe (Gen.
1:2, Prov. 8:22-31, Ps. 33:6, Is. 40:12,13).
<LI>The Spirit gave wisdom (Prov. 8, Is. 11:1-3). mind=ruah.
<LI>The Spirit moved people geographically (Ezekiel 2:2, 3:12-15,
11:24, 37:1, 37:14, 43:5).
<LI>Brings righteousness (Psalm 143:10; Isaiah 4:4).
<LI>Gives life (Gen. 2:7, Job 33:4).
<LI>Sustains life (Psalm 104:10-14, 30).
<LI>Takes life (Is. 40:7; Psalm 104:29; Job 34:14-15).
<LI>The Spirit is omnipresent (Ps. 139:7-10).
</UL>

<P>
The question of the gender of the Holy Spirit is rarely if ever
discussed for the simple reason that the Spirit's masculinity
is naturally assumed from the masculinity of God: God is masculine
and is always addressed as &quot;he&quot;, so surely the same
must be true of the Holy Spirit, a member of the Trinity. Like
most theologians I had always assumed this to be true. I don't
know that anyone ever formally taught me that &quot;the Spirit
is masculine&quot;; it would hardly seem necessary.
<P>
<B>Is There a Question About the Gender of the Holy Spirit?</B>

<P>
In my graduate Semitics program at UCLA, one of the languages
I had to study was Syriac, a dialect of Aramaic written with rounded
letters reminiscent of modern Arabic. Syriac was the language
of people living in northern Mesopotamia, from at least 300 BC
until the time Arabic became dominant in the region, around 1000
AD. Most of the Syriac documents available today were produced
by a Monophysite branch of Christianity, today known as the Syrian
Orthodox Church (monophysitism is the belief that Christ had but
one nature). One striking puzzlement of the texts, at least to
me, was the constant reference to the Holy Spirit as &quot;she&quot;.
I was aware, of course, that in Aramaic (and hence in the dialect
known as Syriac) the natural gender of the word &quot;spirit&quot;
was feminine; however, I was surprised to discover that this accident
of grammar had resulted in a whole theology constructed around
the femininity of the third person of the Godhead.
<P>
An example of Syriac theology is found in the apocryphal Acts
of Thomas; it is usually assumed that this particular work was
influenced by speculative gnostic Judaism because it contains
the notion, that associated with God was a wisdom, or creative
power - a spirit - which was feminine. In an invocation accompanying
baptism, Thomas calls for the Holy Spirit: 
<P>
<blockquote>Come, holy name of Christ that is above every name;
<br>
Come, power of the Most High and perfect compassion; 
<br>
Come, thou highest gift;
<br>
Come, compassionate mother;
<br>
Come, fellowship of the male;
<br>
Come, thou (f.) that dost reveal the hidden mysteries;
<br>
Come, mother of seven houses, that thy rest may be in the eighth
house.
<br>
<I>(Acts of Thomas 2:27)</I><HR>

<P>
Come, silence that dost reveal the great deeds of the whole greatness;

<br>
Come thou that dost show forth the hidden things
<br>
And make the ineffable manifest;
<br>
Holy Dove that bearest the twin young;
<br>
Come, hidden Mother;
<br>
Come, thou that art manifest in thy deeds
<br>
and dost furnish joy and rest for all that are joined with thee;
<br>
Come and partake with us in this Eucharist
<br>
Which we celebrate in thy name,
<br>
and in the love-feast in which we are gathered together at thy
call.
<br>
<I>(Acts of Thomas 5:50)</I></blockquote><HR>

<P>
After reading such materials I decided that Syrian Orthodox Christianity
was somewhat heretical (though perhaps only through an accident
of grammar), and so I wanted nothing to do with Syriac literature.
I would find something else on which to do my dissertation.
<P>
Then came the Spring of 1986.
<P>
I was teaching advanced Hebrew, and I had decided to take the
class through the book of Judges. As we read along, I noticed
something odd about Judges 3:10:
<P>
<blockquote><I>The Spirit of Yahweh came upon Caleb's younger brother...</I></blockquote>

<P>
In English, this passage from Judges doesn't appear startling,
but in Hebrew something strange leapt out at me: &quot;came upon&quot;
was a third person FEMININE verb, indicating it's subject &quot;Spirit&quot;
was being understood as a feminine noun. Hebrew is not like Aramaic
in its use of the word &quot;spirit&quot;. While the word is exclusively
feminine in Aramaic, in Hebrew it is sometimes masculine. Therefore,
the question that came to mind was why had the author of Judges
chosen here to make the Spirit of Yahweh feminine, when he could
just as easily have made it masculine? Oh well.
<P>
I just shrugged my shoulders and went on, not overly concerned.
Occasionally, I thought, one finds something inexplicable in the
Bible: no big deal. But then came Judges 6:34. Again, &quot;Spirit
of Yahweh&quot; was feminine.
<P>
At this point I decided to consult the concordance. Much to my
surprise, every occurrence of &quot;Spirit of Yahweh&quot; in
Judges is feminine. As I pondered that, I recalled Genesis 1:2,
the first occurrence of &quot;Spirit of God&quot; in the Bible,
and realized to my shock that it too is feminine.
<P>
Back to the concordance. Out of 84 OT uses of the word &quot;spirit&quot;,
in contexts traditionally assumed to be references to the Holy
Spirit, 75 times it is either explicitly feminine or indeterminable
(due to lack of a verb or adjective). Only nine times can &quot;spirit&quot;
be construed as masculine, and in those cases it is unclear that
it is a reference to God's Holy Spirit anyway. (Please see Appendix
3 for a complete list and detailed discussion of the usages.)
<P>
The New Testament references to the Holy Spirit are not helpful
for conclusively deciding on the gender of the Holy Spirit, since
&quot;spirit&quot; in Greek is neuter, and so is referred to as
&quot;it&quot; by the New Testament writers.
<P>
The conclusion of all this is that our traditional assumption
of a masculine Spirit is questionable; in fact, the evidence seems
overwhelming that the Spirit should be viewed as &quot;She&quot;,
which does seem to make sense, since the other two members of
the Godhead are labeled &quot;Father&quot; and &quot;Son&quot;.
<P>
What are the theological implications of a feminine Holy Spirit?
There are four:
<UL>
<LI>A feminine Holy Spirit clarifies how women can also be said
to be created in the &quot;image of God&quot;. It has long been
recognized that he Godhead must include some feminine aspects,
since Genesis 1:26-27 explicitly states that both men and women
were created in God's image.
<LI>A feminine Holy Spirit explains the identity of the personified
wisdom in Proverbs 8:12-31:
</UL>

<P>
<blockquote>I, wisdom, dwell together with prudence;
<br>
I possess knowledge and discretion.
<br>
To fear Yahweh is to hate evil;
<br>
I hate pride and arrogance,
<br>
evil behavior and perverse speech.
<br>
Counsel and sound judgment are mine;
<br>
I have understanding and power.
<br>
By me kings reign
<br>
and rulers make laws that are just;
<br>
by me princes govern,
<br>
and all nobles who rule on earth.
<br>
I love those who love me,
<br>
and those who seek me find me.
<br>
With me are riches and honor,
<br>
enduring wealth and prosperity.
<br>
My fruit is better than fine gold;
<br>
what I yield surpasses choice silver.
<br>
I walk in the way of righteousness,
<br>
along the paths of justice,
<br>
bestowing wealth on those who love me
<br>
and making their treasuries full.
<br>
Yahweh possessed me at the beginning of his work,
<br>
before his deeds of old;
<br>
I was appointed from eternity,
<br>
from the beginning,
<br>
before the world began.
<br>
Where there were no oceans, I was given birth,
<br>
when there were no springs abounding with water;
<br>
before the hills, I was given birth,
<br>
before he made the earth or its fields
<br>
or any of the dust of the world.
<br>
I was there when he set the heavens in place,
<br>
when he marked out the horizon
<br>
on the face of the deep,
<br>
when he established the clouds above
<br>
and fixed securely the fountains of the deep,
<br>
when he gave the sea its boundary
<br>
so the waters would not overstep his command,
<br>
and when he marked out the foundations of the earth.
<br>
Then I was the craftsman at his side.
<br>
I was filled with delight day after day,
<br>
rejoicing in his whole world
<br>
and delighting in mankind....</blockquote>
<P>
Some commentators have tried to tie this personification of wisdom
to the idea of Christ as divine &quot;Word&quot; [Gk. <I>logos</I>].
Unfortunately for this theory, the genders of the words in question
get in the way. The gender of the word &quot;wisdom&quot; is feminine,
and is therefore personified as a woman. This makes a direct identification
of &quot;wisdom&quot; with &quot;Christ&quot; virtually impossible.
<P>
Other commentators have pictured &quot;wisdom&quot; as a created
being, like an angel; better have been those who argue that the
personification of wisdom in Proverbs 8 is simply a literary device,
without objective reality.
<P>
However, if the Holy Spirit is feminine, then the identification
is relatively easy: Genesis 1:2 pictures the Spirit of God hovering
over the deep, active in creating the world, just as Proverbs
describes. Both the Old and New Testament connect the idea of
teaching and imparting wisdom with the function of the Holy Spirit
(Ex. 31:3; 35:31; Acts 6:3; Ephesians 1:17; Luke 12:12; and John
14:25-26).
<UL>
<LI>The third benefit of recognizing the femininity of the Holy
Spirit is that it explains the subservient role that the Spirit
plays. The Bible seems to indicate that the Spirit does not speak
for itself or about itself; rather the Spirit only speaks what
it hears. The Spirit is said to have come into the world to glorify
Christ (See John 16:13-14 and Acts 13:2). In contrast, it should
be noted that the Scripture represents both the Father and Son
speaking from and of themselves.
<LI>Finally, a feminine Holy Spirit, with a Father and Son as
the rest of the Trinity, may help explain why the family is the
basic unit of human society.

The angel answered, &quot;The Holy Spirit will come upon you,
and the power of the Most
<P>
High will overshadow you. So the holy one to be born will be called
the Son of
<P>
God. (Luke 1:35)
<UL>
<LI>The Holy Spirit was the author of Scripture
</UL>

<P>
Matthew 5:17, 2 Timothy 3:16; 2 Pet. 1:21, Act. 2:16
<UL>
<LI>The Holy Spirit is the interpreter of Scripture
</UL>

<P>
1 Corinthians 2:10-14, Ephesians 1:17
<P>
On the day of Pentecost the Holy Spirit gave birth to the Church
as a body of living members of which Christ is the risen, exalted
and living Head. (Acts 2:1-4). The foundation of the Church is
the death and resurrection of Christ. (1 Corinthians 12:12-27;
Ephesians 1:20-23; 2:15-16). The &quot;new man&quot; is the Church.
<P>
The Holy Spirit possessed and indwelt the church as the temple
of God. The Holy Spirit indwells the whole church and individual
believers simultaneously (Ephesians 2:19-22; Romans 8:1, 11; John
14:17; 2 Corinthians 1:22).
<P>
<B>What Does the Holy Spirit Do Now?</B> 
<P>
The Holy Spirit confers gifts and graces upon the Church for life,
fruitfulness and service (John 6:63). The Lord's life is brought
to us by the Holy Spirit. (Romans 8:2). The life of Christ is
&quot;the law of the Spirit&quot; (Galatians 5:22-23). The Holy
Spirit is the fruitbearer; the word &quot;fruit&quot; is singular,
not plural.
<P>
The Holy Spirit imparts anointing, illumination, and guidance
for the Church (2 Corinthians 1:21; 1 John 2:20, 27; Rom 8:14).
The Holy Spirit's strategic relationship to the understanding
of the truth. The Holy Spirit is the One who seals and anoints
(associated with sealing). The Holy Spirit sets apart the child
of God for the ministry of God.
<P>
The Holy Spirit presides over and directs the Church into the
will and plan of God. This explains apostolic ministry in missions
(Acts. 13:1-3; 15:28; 20:28; 1 Corinthians 12:8-11).
<P>
The Holy Spirit baptizes the believer into the Body of Christ
(Matthew 16:18, Acts 1:4-5, 2:3, 2:47, 11:15; 1 Corinthians 12:13;
6:15-17; Ephesians 2:16; 4:4-5, 16; 5:30-32; Colossians 1:24;
2:19; Galatians 3:27).
<P>
<I><B>Pentacost </B></I>
<P>
<blockquote>On one occasion, while he was eating with them, he gave them this
command: &quot;Do not leave Jerusalem, but wait for the gift my
Father promised, which you have heard me speak about. For John
baptized with water, but in a few days you will be baptized with
the Holy Spirit.&quot; (Acts 1:4-5)
<P>
But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you;
and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and
Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.&quot; (Acts 1:8)
<P>
When the day of Pentecost came, they were all together in one
place. Suddenly a sound like the blowing of a violent wind came
from heaven and filled the whole house where they were sitting.
They saw what seemed to be tongues of fire that separated and
came to rest on each of them. All of them were filled with the
Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit
enabled them. Now there were staying in Jerusalem God-fearing
Jews from every nation under heaven. (Acts 2:1-5)</blockquote>
<P>
<I><B>Convicts the World</B></I> 
<P>
<blockquote>But I tell you the truth: It is for your good that I am going
away. Unless I go away, the Counselor will not come to you; but
if I go, I will send him to you. When he comes, he will convict
the world of guilt in regard to sin and righteousness and judgment:
in regard to sin, because men do not believe in me; in regard
to righteousness, because I am going to the Father, where you
can see me no longer; and in regard to judgment, because the prince
of this world now stands condemned. (John 16:7-11)</blockquote>
<P>
The Holy Spirit reveals the truth of the Gospel and brings people
to God. That such is necessary is clear from statements such as
Romans 3:10-18 (see also: 1 Corinthians 2:14, Romans 8:5-7, 2
Corinthians 4:4, Ephesians 4:18)
<P>
<blockquote>As it is written: &quot;There is no one righteous, not even one;
there is no one who understands, no one who seeks God. All have
turned away, they have together become worthless; there is no
one who does good, not even one.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Their throats are open graves; their tongues practice deceit.&quot;
&quot;The poison of vipers is on their lips.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Their feet are swift to shed blood; ruin and misery mark
their ways, and the way of peace they do not know.&quot;
<P>
&quot;There is no fear of God before their eyes.&quot;</blockquote>
<P>
The Holy Spirit makes use of the Bible to reach people with the
message of the gospel. Without the Word, conversion is unlikely.
Consider the statement Abraham made to the rich man after he begged
him to send Lazarus back from the dead to his family:
<P>
<blockquote>&quot;He answered, 'Then I beg you, father, send Lazarus to my
father's house, for I have five brothers. Let him warn them, so
that they will not also come to this place of torment.'
<P>
&quot;Abraham replied, 'They have Moses and the Prophets; let
them listen to them.'
<P>
&quot;'No, father Abraham,' he said, 'but if someone from the
dead goes to them, they will repent.'
<P>
&quot;He said to him, 'If they do not listen to Moses and the
Prophets, they will not be convinced even if someone rises from
the dead.'&quot; (Luke 16:27-31)</blockquote>
<P>
Consider also Romans 1:16, 10:14-17, and Psalm 119:105. Apart
from a biblical ministry there is no Gospel.
<P>
Salvation depends upon faith in Christ. Righteousness is available
only through Christ and judgment comes upon the one without Christ.
God, has, however, revealed himself to some extent to the entire
world, whether they have heard the Gospel message from the Bible
or not. This general revelation, and general call to the human
race to repent and turn to God is referred to sometimes as &quot;common&quot;
grace. This is clear from Paul's words in Romans 1:17-32:
<P>
<blockquote>For in the gospel a righteousness from God is revealed, a righteousness
that is by faith from first to last, just as it is written: &quot;The
righteous will live by faith.&quot;
<P>
The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the
godlessness and wickedness of men who suppress the truth by their
wickedness, since what may be known about God is plain to them,
because God has made it plain to them. For since the creation
of the world God's invisible qualities-his eternal power and divine
nature-have been clearly seen, being understood from what has
been made, so that men are without excuse.
<P>
For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God
nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their
foolish hearts were darkened. Although they claimed to be wise,
they became fools and exchanged the glory of the immortal God
for images made to look like mortal man and birds and animals
and reptiles.
<P>
Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts
to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one
another. They exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped
and served created things rather than the Creator-who is forever
praised. Amen.
<P>
Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their
women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same
way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were
inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts
with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for
their perversion.
<P>
Furthermore, since they did not think it worthwhile to retain
the knowledge of God, he gave them over to a depraved mind, to
do what ought not to be done. They have become filled with every
kind of wickedness, evil, greed and depravity. They are full of
envy, murder, strife, deceit and malice. They are gossips, slanderers,
God-haters, insolent, arrogant and boastful; they invent ways
of doing evil; they disobey their parents; they are senseless,
faithless, heartless, ruthless. Although they know God's righteous
decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only
continue to do these very things but also approve of those who
practice them.</blockquote>
<P>
This is also reflected in what Psalm 19:1-4a:
<P>
<blockquote>The heavens declare the glory of God; 
<br>
the skies proclaim the work of his hands.
<br>
Day after day they pour forth speech;
<br>
night after night they display knowledge.
<br>
There is no speech or language where their voice is not heard.

<br>
Their voice goes out into all the earth, 
<br>
their words to the ends of the world.</blockquote><P>
<HR>

<P>
There are serious limitations to common grace, or what is called
general revelation. It is not efficacious knowledge of the Gospel.
It does not necessitate salvation in the heart. It involves the
general call (Matthew 22:14) &quot;Many are called, but few chosen.&quot;
(see also Romans 1:32, Matthew 9:13, 13:20 and Hebrews 6:4). It
is not equivalent to the believer's illumination generally, but
is restricted to the Gospel. It provides none of the normal Christian
experiences which are the fruit of the spirit. It involved general
phenomena, from the universal fear of God in general ignorance
to the brink of salvation with full information.
<P>
It should be kept in mind, too, that no one can have an excuse.
Essentially, if an individual fails to respond to the light or
the call that God has given generally in the universe at large,
then God is not obligated to give any additional light or information.
Like the relatives of the rich man in torment, if they won't listen
to the Bible, then why would they listen to a dead man raised
to life? If an individual doesn't respond in faith to what he
can see of God's goodness and power in the creation, then why
would God feel obligated to give any more information?
<P>
<blockquote>When he comes, he will convict the world of guilt in regard to
sin and righteousness and judgment (John 16:8)</blockquote>
<P>
Common grace is not sufficient to save, but it is sufficient to
condemn. Ryrie illustrated it this way: you offer a man a hundred
dollars, but he refuses to take it. This is your basis for refusing
to offer him any more.
<P>
The light of God is visible to all; if a person rejects the light
of natural revelation, then why would God bother to give him special
revelation?
<P>
Common grace is a ministry of the Holy Spirit that reveals the
truth of God to humanity wherever and whenever given in any form.
<P>
Arminians would say that everyone has enough grace to accept Christ,
if they want to. Calvinists, in contrast, would say that common
grace is sufficient only to render human beings inexcusable for
their unbelief (Romans 1:16).
<P>
Efficacious grace is given to a person when the Lord brings that
one to himself. It is the ministry of the Holy Spirit which is
certainly effectual in revealing the Gospel and in leading to
saving faith. (Ephesians 2:8-9). Efficacious grace secures the
salvation of the one who has been chosen by God. It is the instantaneous
work of God empowering the human will and inclining the human
heart to faith in Christ. It is irresistable (Romans 9:19 and
John 3:8). Once God has determined that a person will belong to
him, that person will no longer be able to resist the call.
<P>
<I><B>Indwells Believers (and Anoints) </B></I>
<P>
<blockquote>But when he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he will guide you into
all truth. He will not speak on his own; he will speak only what
he hears, and he will tell you what is yet to come. He will bring
glory to me by taking from what is mine and making it known to
you. All that belongs to the Father is mine. That is why I said
the Spirit will take from what is mine and make it known to you.
(John 16:13-15)
<P>
You, however, are controlled not by the sinful nature but by the
Spirit, if the Spirit of God lives in you. And if anyone does
not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Christ. But
if Christ is in you, your body is dead because of sin, yet your
spirit is alive because of righteousness. And if the Spirit of
him who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you, he who raised
Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies
through his Spirit, who lives in you. (Romans 8:9-11)</blockquote>
<P>
Anointing is the initial act of indwelling; two other words come
to mind with this concept: baptism and filling. In a careful study
of the two terms, there seems little difference between filling
and the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Both seem to be initial acts
of God upon believers that unite them with Christ. It is something
that occures at salvation, but it also seems to be an ongoing
process. Some people make a distinction between baptism and filling.
Baptism in such thinking, is what occures at salvation, when a
person becomes a Christian. Filling can be a daily occurrence,
and involves surrender and openess to the will of God. Others
talk about salvation as one experience, and baptism as a secondary
experience, when a person recieves a spiritual gift, usually,
in the minds of those with this theological persuasion, the gift
of tongues.
<P>
However, it is clear from scripture that an individual must have
the Holy Spirit in order to be a Christian. Consider Romans 8:9
<P>
<blockquote>You, however, are controlled not by the sinful nature but by the
Spirit, if the Spirit of God lives in you. And if anyone does
not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Christ.</blockquote>
<P>
<I><B>Gives Us Union With Christ</B></I> 
<P>
If we have been united with him like this in his death, we will
certainly also be united with him in his resurrection. (Romans
6:5)
<P>
Romans 6:5. The phrase &quot;in Christ&quot; with its equivalents
such as &quot;in Him&quot; &quot;in Whom&quot; &quot;in Christ
Jesus&quot; and so on appear in the New Testament no less than
130 times. It is found twelve times in the first chapter of Ephesians
alone. Union with Christ is very closely associated with the doctrines
of 1) regeneration and 2) the indwelling of the Holy Spirit.
<P>
Union with Christ is achieved by the baptism of the Holy Spirit.
1 Corinthians 12:12-13 discusses the way in which believers are
made members of the church which is Christ's body. Neither the
church nor the baptizing of the Spirit were known prior to the
death of Christ. In Romans 6:3-6 the placing of believers in Christ
is mentioned and union with Christ is plainly the issue in verse
5. Water baptism is in view as a figure of the words &quot;in
the likeness of his death&quot; (vs. 5)
<P>
Union with Christ is inseparable from the doctrine of adoption.
Romans 8:15 speaks of &quot;the Spirit of adoption&quot; which
we interpret to mean &quot;the Spirit Who Adopts&quot;. The text
thus means that the Holy Spirit places believers in the church
as mature and responsible sons. At the rapture and resurrection,
Christians will receive the final benefit of adoption, which is
the resurrected body (Romans 8:23). Galatians 4:5 and Ephesians
1:5 support the concept of this age enjoying a position of responsible
adult sons.
<P>
Union with Christ is identified as a new Creation. 2 Corinthians
5:17 and Galatians 6:15 refer to the unique believer in this age
who is &quot;in Christ&quot;. Both passages are positional and
speak of the Risen Christ and His members. Resurrection is in
view in Romans 8:23.
<P>
Union with Christ is the motive for Christian living. The figures
of marriage (Romans 7:4; Ephesians 5:32), the vine and the branches
(John 15:1-8), the Head and the body (Colossians 1:18, 234; 2:6-7),
etc. indicate that the believer is to cultivate Christlikeness
(2 Corinthians 3:18; 2 Peter 3:18; 1 John 3:1-3) on the premise
that we should live what we are in Christ. There may be no more
sublime truth to be embraced than that of which our Lord spoke
in John 14:20. &quot;At that day (i.e. Penetcost) you shall know
that I am in my Father, and you are in me, and I am in you.&quot;
This is the very heart of the doctrine of union with Christ.
<P>
<I><B>The Filling of the Holy Spirit</B></I> 
<P>
&quot;From the viewpoint of practice and experience, the filling
with the Spirit is the most important aspect of the doctrine of
the Holy Spirit&quot; according to Ryrie. (Ephesians 5:18, Acts.
2:4, 33; Acts. 4:8, 31; 6:3; 13:9)
<P>
Filling is experiential truth. It is not the promise of salvation
but of Christian living. The other ministires of the Spriit (efficacious
grace, regeneration, indwelling and anointing, sealing and baptism)
are commonly called positional truth. This ministry involves practical
living.
<P>
Propositional truth is one of the basic distinctions between law
and grace (Romans 9:30-10:4).
<P>
What are some prohibitions and admonition of the Spirit-filled
life? We are told to &quot;grieve not&quot; the Holy Spirit in
Ephesians 4:30. This is dealing in terms of love, not anger. The
issue is sin in the Christian's life, or the entertaining of sin
in the believer's heart. The remedy is confession (1 John 1:9)
<P>
Some scriptures dealing with Sin in a believer's life include
John 13:1-15, 1 John 1:5-10, 1 Corinthians 11:31-34, Hebrews 12:1-4,
Psalm 51:1-10, Luke 15:1-32, and 2 Corinthians 7:7-10. It is important
to keep in mind that these are not legalistic dos and don'ts.
Rather, the nature of a Christian's life, who has the indwelling
Spirit of God, will be one where such behavior will be minimal,
precisely because it grieves the Holy Spirit. Where the non-Christian
may have a conscience, the Christian now has God inside him or
her. Talk about feeling bad when you sin! A Christian who sins
is very unhappy because of the indwelling Holy Spirit.
<P>
In a similary vein, the Christian is told to &quot;quench not&quot;
the Holy Spirit in 1 Thessalonians 5:19. This doesn't mean to
extinguish, but rather &quot;to stifle&quot; or &quot;to suppress&quot;.
The issue and answer is yieldedness to the will of God (Ephesians
5:15-17)
<P>
Two strategic Scriptures: Romans 12:1-2 and Romans 6:1-14 (this
is almost a commentary on 1 Thes. 5:19 - &quot;continue in sin&quot;
has the sense of `the sin nature' as opposed to being now in the
Spirit.)
<P>
We are also told to &quot;walk in the Spirit&quot; in such passages
as Galatians 5:16-25, Ephesians 5:15-18 (see also 2:10, 4:2),
and Romans 8:1-4 (see also Romans 6:4). A Christian who tries
to resist the Spirit will not ultimately be successful; that is,
sooner or later, the Spirit will come to dominate. Secondly, walking
in the Spirit, not grieving the Spirit, and not quenching the
Spirit are the normal and happiest conditions of the human life
who has been converted to Christ.
<P>
Having God living inside us has some inevitable consequences.
What are these results of the filling of the Spirit? Many positive
things: we are in the process of sanctification (Galatians 5:22-23,
John 15:1-5, Romans 8:4, and 1 John 3:1-3). Not that we are sinless
now, but that is the process that God has us involved with. The
Holy Spirit spends a lifetime teaching us (1 John 2:27 and 1 Corinthians
2:9-3:2), giving us guidance (Genesis 24:27, Romans 8:14, Galatians
5:18, Exodus 13:17-18, Psalm 103:7, and Proverbs 3:5-6), and giving
us assurance (Romans 8:16, Galatians 4:6, 1 John 3:24 and 4:13).
The Holy Spirit allows us to worship God in Spirit and in truth
(Ephesians 5:18-20 and John 4:24); the Holy Spirit makes our prayers
possible and meaningful (Romans 8:26), and empowers us for service
(John 7:38-39 and Ephesians 2:10, among others).
<P>
<I><B>Regenerates</B></I> 
<P>
The Holy Spirit is the one responsible for our regeneration or
our conversion. We are born of God (John 1:12, 13; the Father
is the author of regeneration; cf. 1 John 4:7; 5:1, 4, 12, 18;
3:9; 2:29). We are born anew, again, or from above according to
John 3:3-5; 2 Corinthians 3:6 argues that &quot;the Spirit gives
life&quot;. The Holy Spirit is the personal agent.
<P>
1 Peter 1:23 tells us that in Christ we are not of corruptible
seed
<P>
What is involved in regeneration? The Holy Spirit imparts a new
nature which involves eternal life (2 Peter 1:4). It is not just
a quickening of the old nature (Ephesians 2:3; 4:24; Phil. 1:6;
Colossians 2:13; 2 Corinthians 5:17)
<P>
Differences exist between nature and personality. God takes us,
not simply our nature. Upon rebirth, we keep our own nature, the
seed of Adam, and we receive the life of Christ (including Christ
Himself) and become the residence of the Holy Spirit. &quot;Making
alive&quot; doesn't mean transforming our nature. We partake of
the divine nature. Ephesians 2:10 indicates that it is not an
improvement but a creation.
<P>
There are three things involved in regeneration:
<P>
1. New birth (John 3:3-8)
<P>
2. Resurrection (Romans 6:13; Ephesians 2:5; John 5:21; 2 Corinthians
5:17)
<P>
3. Creation (Ephesians 2:10; 4:24; 2 Corinthians 5:17)
<P>
There are three persons involved in regeneration: the Father (John
5:21 and James 1:17), the Son (John 5:21and 2 Corinthians 5:17),
and the Holy Spirit (John 3:5 and Titus 3:5).
<P>
<I><B>Seals </B></I>
<P>
The Holy Spirit is said to seal us to the day of redemption. (see
2 Corinthians 1:21-22, Ephesians 1:13-14 and Ephesians 4:30).
<P>
<I><B>Fruit</B></I> 
<P>
But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness,
goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. Against such
things there is no law. (Galatians 5:22-23)
<P>
<I><B>Gifts</B></I> 
<P>
<blockquote>For by the grace given me I say to every one of you: Do not think
of yourself more highly than you ought, but rather think of yourself
with sober judgment, in accordance with the measure of faith God
has given you. Just as each of us has one body with many members,
and these members do not all have the same function, so in Christ
we who are many form one body, and each member belongs to all
the others. We have different gifts, according to the grace given
us. If a man's gift is prophesying, let him use it in proportion
to his faith. If it is serving, let him serve; if it is teaching,
let him teach; if it is encouraging, let him encourage; if it
is contributing to the needs of others, let him give generously;
if it is leadership, let him govern diligently; if it is showing
mercy, let him do it cheerfully. (Romans 12:3-8)
<P>
Now about spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want you to be ignorant.
You know that when you were pagans, somehow or other you were
influenced and led astray to mute idols. Therefore I tell you
that no one who is speaking by the Spirit of God says, &quot;Jesus
be cursed,&quot; and no one can say, &quot;Jesus is Lord,&quot;
except by the Holy Spirit. There are different kinds of gifts,
but the same Spirit. There are different kinds of service, but
the same Lord. There are different kinds of working, but the same
God works all of them in all men. Now to each one the manifestation
of the Spirit is given for the common good. To one there is given
through the Spirit the message of wisdom, to another the message
of knowledge by means of the same Spirit, to another faith by
the same Spirit, to another gifts of healing by that one Spirit,
to another miraculous powers, to another prophecy, to another
distinguishing between spirits, to another speaking in different
kinds of tongues, and to still another the interpretation of tongues.
All these are the work of one and the same Spirit, and he gives
them to each one, just as he determines.
<P>
The body is a unit, though it is made up of many parts; and though
all its parts are many, they form one body. So it is with Christ.
For we were all baptized by one Spirit into one body-whether Jews
or Greeks, slave or free - and we were all given the one Spirit
to drink.</blockquote>

<P>
<blockquote>Now the body is not made up of one part but of many. If the foot
should say, &quot;Because I am not a hand, I do not belong to
the body,&quot; it would not for that reason cease to be part
of the body. And if the ear should say, &quot;Because I am not
an eye, I do not belong to the body,&quot; it would not for that
reason cease to be part of the body. If the whole body were an
eye, where would the sense of hearing be? If the whole body were
an ear, where would the sense of smell be? But in fact God has
arranged the parts in the body, every one of them, just as he
wanted them to be. If they were all one part, where would the
body be? As it is, there are many parts, but one body.
<P>
The eye cannot say to the hand, &quot;I don't need you!&quot;
And the head cannot say to the feet, &quot;I don't need you!&quot;
On the contrary, those parts of the body that seem to be weaker
are indispensable, and the parts that we think are less honorable
we treat with special honor. And the parts that are unpresentable
are treated with special modesty, while our presentable parts
need no special treatment. But God has combined the members of
the body and has given greater honor to the parts that lacked
it, so that there should be no division in the body, but that
its parts should have equal concern for each other. If one part
suffers, every part suffers with it; if one part is honored, every
part rejoices with it.
<P>
Now you are the body of Christ, and each one of you is a part
of it. And in the church God has appointed first of all apostles,
second prophets, third teachers, then workers of miracles, also
those having gifts of healing, those able to help others, those
with gifts of administration, and those speaking in different
kinds of tongues. Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all
teachers? Do all work miracles? Do all have gifts of healing?
Do all speak in tongues ? Do all interpret? But eagerly desire
the greater gifts.
<P>
And now I will show you the most excellent way.
<P>
If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love,
I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal. If I have the
gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge,
and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but have not love,
I am nothing. If I give all I possess to the poor and surrender
my body to the flames, but have not love, I gain nothing.
<P>
Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast,
it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is
not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not
delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects,
always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.
<P>
Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease;
where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is
knowledge, it will pass away. For we know in part and we prophesy
in part, but when perfection comes, the imperfect disappears.
When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child,
I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put childish ways
behind me. Now we see but a poor reflection as in a mirror; then
we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know
fully, even as I am fully known.
<P>
And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest
of these is love.
<P>
Follow the way of love and eagerly desire spiritual gifts, especially
the gift of prophecy. For anyone who speaks in a tongue does not
speak to men but to God. Indeed, no one understands him; he utters
mysteries with his spirit. But everyone who prophesies speaks
to men for their strengthening, encouragement and comfort. He
who speaks in a tongue edifies himself, but he who prophesies
edifies the church. I would like every one of you to speak in
tongues, but I would rather have you prophesy. He who prophesies
is greater than one who speaks in tongues, unless he interprets,
so that the church may be edified.
<P>
Now, brothers, if I come to you and speak in tongues, what good
will I be to you, unless I bring you some revelation or knowledge
or prophecy or word of instruction? Even in the case of lifeless
things that make sounds, such as the flute or harp, how will anyone
know what tune is being played unless there is a distinction in
the notes? Again, if the trumpet does not sound a clear call,
who will get ready for battle? So it is with you. Unless you speak
intelligible words with your tongue, how will anyone know what
you are saying? You will just be speaking into the air. Undoubtedly
there are all sorts of languages in the world, yet none of them
is without meaning. If then I do not grasp the meaning of what
someone is saying, I am a foreigner to the speaker, and he is
a foreigner to me. So it is with you. Since you are eager to have
spiritual gifts, try to excel in gifts that build up the church.
<P>
For this reason anyone who speaks in a tongue should pray that
he may interpret what he says. For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit
prays, but my mind is unfruitful. So what shall I do? I will pray
with my spirit, but I will also pray with my mind; I will sing
with my spirit, but I will also sing with my mind. If you are
praising God with your spirit, how can one who finds himself among
those who do not understand say &quot;Amen&quot; to your thanksgiving,
since he does not know what you are saying? You may be giving
thanks well enough, but the other man is not edified.
<P>
I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you. But
in the church I would rather speak five intelligible words to
instruct others than ten thousand words in a tongue.
<P>
Brothers, stop thinking like children. In regard to evil be infants,
but in your thinking be adults. In the Law it is written:
<P>
<blockquote>&quot;Through men of strange tongues
<br>
and through the lips of foreigners
<br>
I will speak to this people,
<br>
but even then they will not listen to me,&quot; says the Lord.</blockquote>
<P>
Tongues, then, are a sign, not for believers but for unbelievers;
prophecy, however, is for believers, not for unbelievers. So if
the whole church comes together and everyone speaks in tongues,
and some who do not understand or some unbelievers come in, will
they not say that you are out of your mind? But if an unbeliever
or someone who does not understand comes in while everybody is
prophesying, he will be convinced by all that he is a sinner and
will be judged by all, and the secrets of his heart will be laid
bare. So he will fall down and worship God, exclaiming, &quot;God
is really among you!&quot;
<P>
What then shall we say, brothers? When you come together, everyone
has a hymn, or a word of instruction, a revelation, a tongue or
an interpretation. All of these must be done for the strengthening
of the church. If anyone speaks in a tongue, two-or at the most
three - should speak, one at a time, and someone must interpret.
If there is no interpreter, the speaker should keep quiet in the
church and speak to himself and God.
<P>
Two or three prophets should speak, and the others should weigh
carefully what is said. And if a revelation comes to someone who
is sitting down, the first speaker should stop. For you can all
prophesy in turn so that everyone may be instructed and encouraged.
The spirits of prophets are subject to the control of prophets.
For God is not a God of disorder but of peace.
<P>
As in all the congregations of the saints, women should remain
silent in the churches. They are not allowed to speak, but must
be in submission, as the Law says. If they want to inquire about
something, they should ask their own husbands at home; for it
is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church.
<P>
Did the word of God originate with you? Or are you the only people
it has reached? If anybody thinks he is a prophet or spiritually
gifted, let him acknowledge that what I am writing to you is the
Lord's command. If he ignores this, he himself will be ignored.
<P>
Therefore, my brothers, be eager to prophesy, and do not forbid
speaking in tongues. But everything should be done in a fitting
and orderly way. (1 Corinthians 12-14)
<P>
God also testified to it by signs, wonders and various miracles,
and gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his will.
(Hebrews 2:4)
<P>
It was he who gave some to be apostles, some to be prophets, some
to be evangelists, and some to be pastors and teachers, to prepare
God's people for works of service, so that the body of Christ
may be built up until we all reach unity in the faith and in the
knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the
whole measure of the fullness of Christ.
<P>
Then we will no longer be infants, tossed back and forth by the
waves, and blown here and there by every wind of teaching and
by the cunning and craftiness of men in their deceitful scheming.
Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will in all things grow
up into him who is the Head, that is, Christ. From him the whole
body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows
and builds itself up in love, as each part does its work. (Ephesians
4:11-16)
<P>
For in him you have been enriched in every way-in all your speaking
and in all your knowledge - because our testimony about Christ
was confirmed in you. Therefore you do not lack any spiritual
gift as you eagerly wait for our Lord Jesus Christ to be revealed.
(1 Corinthians 1:5-7)
<P>
Above all, love each other deeply, because love covers over a
multitude of sins. Offer hospitality to one another without grumbling.
Each one should use whatever gift he has received to serve others,
faithfully administering God's grace in its various forms. If
anyone speaks, he should do it as one speaking the very words
of God. If anyone serves, he should do it with the strength God
provides, so that in all things God may be praised through Jesus
Christ. To him be the glory and the power for ever and ever. Amen.
(1 Peter 4:8-11)</blockquote>
<P>
1Cor 14 indicates that tongues were to be regulated. Considering
the context, some have suggested that the &quot;speaking&quot;
of women (in 34) is related to speaking in tongues.
<P>
The one basic position that unites all pentacostles is their odd
belief that &quot;the baptism of the Holy Spirit&quot; is a distinct
experience which all believers may and should have following conversion.
The biblical point of view is that the baptism of the Holy Spirit
is the moment of conversion and tongues, rather than a sign of
the baptism, are merely one of at least fifteen other possible
gifts that a person might get.
<P>
Some people image that Apostleship, prophecy, miracles, healing
and tongues were temporary gifts that ceased functioning after
the apostolic age. Why? Primarily in reaction to the excesses
and abuses in some churches. Rather than seeking to argue for
the appropriate use of the gifts of tongues, it is easier to simply
forbid them. This is remarkably similar to the position of first
century Judaism, which sought to protect the law by building hedges
around it.
<P>
That is, in order to prevent the breaking of a law in the Bible,
the ancient Rabbis devised added laws, that if kept, would make
it impossible to even come close to violating the scriptural prohibition.
So, for instance, the Jewish people, to this day, do not pronounce
God's name, Yahweh. Instead, whenever they come upon it in the
Bible, they say &quot;adonai&quot; or &quot;ha-shem&quot;, meaning,
respectively, &quot;lord&quot; and &quot;the name.&quot; By never
pronouncing God's name, they are assured of never violating the
commandment prohibiting the taking of God's name in vain.
<P>
Likewise, the kosher regulation to keep milk and meat products
completely separate, and to never consume a meal with both items
in attendance, goes back to the concern not to violate Exodus
23:19, Exodus 34:26, and Deuteronomy 14:21:
<P>
<blockquote>Bring the best of the firstfruits of your soil to the house of
the LORD your God. &quot;Do not cook a young goat in its mother's
milk.&quot; (Exodus 23:19)</blockquote>
<P>
It is far easier just to toss out the possibility to tongues,
than to struggle with their proper application and use. Unfortunately,
the single passage used to try to argue that tongues no longer
exist, 1 Corinthians 13:8, seems useable only if you've decided
in advance that that is the intent; one must, in my opinion, twist
the text to get it to indicate that tongues would cease before
the second coming of Christ - especially when one considers that
in the very next chapter Paul discusses their proper application
and use, and makes the profound statement, hard for those who
believe tongues are wrong to get around:
<P>
<blockquote>Therefore, my brothers, be eager to prophesy, and do not forbid
speaking in tongues. (1 Corinthians 14:39).</blockquote>
<P>
The caveat, of course, follows in the next verse: &quot;But everything
should be done in a fitting and orderly way.&quot; The only reason
for desiring the end of one of God's gifts is because it is unliked
and makes some people uncomfortable, especially since it is so
commonly abused. Frankly, I suspect that most instances of tongues
speaking has little if anything to do with God's Holy Spirit and
everything to do with peer pressure, pride, and emotional hype.
