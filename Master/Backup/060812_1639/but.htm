life as an example of this. If it were not for my wife and I meeting, if it were
not for the fact that we are both infertile, if it were not for the fact that
we went through some unpleasantness at a certain college in Newhall,
California, which set us up for moving to Lancaster, California, we would not
have found out about Hannah's Foster Finding agency, and we would not have
wound up in the middle of December 1993 with a tiny, scared, and neglected 8
pound, 4 month old coming into our home and lives, nor would the next two
little baby girls who came in 1996 have wound up with us either.<span

is more to our suffering than just that, but that is an obvious and clear cut
example of what the hand of God working in two lives managed to accomplish, and
the importance of the suffering that we endured.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>And my life is not unique in this regard; most Christians, who
have gone through hard times, can look back and say with certainty that there
was a purpose to the agony they experienced.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>And if nothing else, we have the perfect example in the life of Jesus
himself: leaving behind a perfect environment, absolute power, complete
control, infinite knowledge and experience, to become a baby, born in a stable,
growing up in a dirty, pre-industrial society, leading a handful of men in long
peripatetic walks about a rather hilly country, doing good, only to be betrayed
by one of his best friends and executed in one of the most painful ways
imaginable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And yet we know how the
story ends, and we understand clearly the enormous benefit that his suffering
produced.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It was worth it to him, even
as he was uncomfortable going through it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>We are called upon to imitate Christ, to consider his way of life.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We can see the same pattern of unpleasant
and uncomfortable circumstances in person after person in the Bible, and yet,
from our perspective in our more comfortable situations, we recognize the
necessity and value of what they experienced.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

am.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I have gained fuel for creative
expression; my future novels will be informed, colored, impacted, themed, and
built upon what I have been through. Would the current novel I’m working on
become what it will be, will future novels, perhaps yet unthought or imagined,
exist only because of the last couple of years of my life?<span

artists, poets, writers, musicians, and they have lives that are not always

answer: &quot;He was bombing the crap out of Nazi Germany.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>We may
legitimately wonder why he didn't just snap his fingers and end it
instantly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>But then again, when has he
ever done that?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It took ten plagues
over at least a year to get the Israelites out of Egypt.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And even then, the Egyptians weren't so
impressed that it prevented them from pursuing the Israelites to the Red
Sea.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And then, another forty years
passed before the Israelites began the conquest of Palestine -- a conquest that
took another few years of long, hard and bloody fighting --<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>and was far from complete by the end of
Joshua's life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
Holocaust would be a more serious challenge to the existence of God only if
Hitler had won.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He didn't.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>lost</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The Bible
gives us the hope that God will ultimately triumph and good will prevail.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We ask why God doesn't do something about
all the evil in the world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>But that
overlooks the simple fact that he has done, and continues to do something about
it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Every day.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We're just too impatient.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>So why
didn't God just kill Hitler when he was a soldier on the field of battle in
World War I?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Or better yet, why didn't
Hitler succumb to his childhood illnesses?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Yet,
consider all the soldiers who do die in war, and all the children who do die
young.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And when these sad events
transpire, we moan, &quot;Where's God?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>How could God let that innocent die?&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>So God is damned if he does, and damned if he doesn't.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
question of why doesn't God do something about evil is actually, &quot;Why
doesn't God solve it the way I think would be best.&quot;<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It is a disagreement over tactics.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
following fable may also help us as we consider the problem of evil: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“It is
quite clear that there can be no such thing as the Owner,” said the old dog. He
had perched himself on the edge of the chair and surveyed the pups below them.
“Consider the obvi­ous fact of the existence of the Veterinarian.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The little
pups shivered in fear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“Is there
anything positive that might be said about the Veterinarian?” asked the old
dog.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“Perhaps it
is to teach us something?” squeaked one little pup.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The old dog
laughed. “What possible thing can you learn from being jabbed and prodded and
tormented in that little cage? That you don’t like being poked? I could have
told you that without the experience.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“Perhaps
free will has something to do with it?” suggested another little pup.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Again, the old dog laughed. “We assume that the Owner is
all-knowing and all-powerful and that on top of that he loves us and cares for
us.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“We do
receive food every day,” pointed out another small pup.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“Then why
is there the suffering of the Veterinarian?” demanded the old dog. “If the
Owner was all-knowing and all-powerful, couldn’t he keep us from having to
endure such suffer­ing?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“Well
certainly,” agreed the pups.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“Then why
doesn’t he? If he loved us, wouldn’t he keep the Veterinarian away? In fact,
why is there even a Veterinarian at all? It is obvious that the existence of
the Veterinarian is in­compatible with the existence of the Owner. Either that,
or the Owner is not powerful, or else the Owner is not good. There is no way of
reconciling the existence of the Owner in the traditional sense with the
obvious reality of the Veterinarian.”</p>

style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>It is absolutely impossible for the
dogs to ever understand why the Veterinarian is neces­sary, or that the
Veterinarian is actually an element in the Owner’s love for them. Certainly
this is not a perfect analogy, but just as the Veterinarian is nothing but
horrible for a dog, perhaps the why of the existence of evil, the reality of
suffering, and all that entails is simply beyond our com­prehension. That it
seems so “obviously” incompatible with the nature of God or even the exis­tence
of God does not mean that it necessarily is. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Evil is an
intractable problem.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It is very
difficult to solve, given the allowance of freedom.<span style="mso-spacerun:

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>How do you avoid censorship and protect
children at the same time?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In a very
small way, this helps illustrate the sort of dilemma facing God when we think
about the importance of freedom and the inevitability freedom gives for
individuals to make appalling choices.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Finally, in
relation to the question of evil and the difficulty some think it creates for
simultaneously allowing the existence of a good, all-powerful deity: if there

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b><i><h3>The Complaint of Jacob</i> by R.P. Nettelhorst</h3></b>  
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jacob’s life was not a particularly easy one and his family life, both growing up, and then as an adult was certainly what would fit the modern definition of being “dysfunctional.”  <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So, to say the least, Jacob was not at all happy.  The one true love of his life was dead.  Joseph, his favorite, the oldest son of his beloved, had been dead for twenty-five years.  And now Simeon had been taken from him, and this monster in Egypt was demanding the last link he had to his dead lover.  Beside himself with grief, we find his reaction in Genesis 42:36 where it all comes down to this:<p>
<blockquote>
Their father Jacob said to them, "You have deprived me of my children. Joseph is no more and Simeon is no more, and now you want to take Benjamin. Everything is against me!" 
</blockquote><p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And certainly it was the case that the circumstances of his life, from his perspective, from the perspective of his sons standing around him, made his complaint fully reasonable and perfectly understandable.
And yet, the fascinating thing about his words, for those of us reading the story, is that we know that he couldn’t be more wrong, despite the fact that his words seemed so obviously true to Jacob – unassailably true, in fact.  But we the readers of this little episode, know something that Jacob doesn’t: we know that Joseph is not only not dead, but he is second in command in Egypt, the most powerful and most wealthy nation on the planet at that time.  We also know that there’s no way for poor Jacob to know that.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So the reality of Jacob’s existence is that everything could hardly be better.  His favorite son has done very well for himself, thank you.  Good job, and great future, with money to burn.   Poor Jacob simply doesn’t know this yet.  His perception, his perspective of reality, is incorrect.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And we, the readers, can do nothing to alleviate Jacob’s suffering just now. And God didn’t do anything about it either.  It’ll be another year before Jacob learns the truth of what his life is really like.  For twenty-five years he mourned for someone who was not dead at all.  He bemoans his fate as a miserable one, though his family is absolutely powerful and prosperous.  But he doesn’t know any of that; in fact, he has no way of knowing any of that.

<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;September 11, 2001 was thus an exceptionally bad day (to say the least) and raised numerous questions in the minds of many people about the nature of existence, about the goodness of God, about what it is really, that God wants and expects out of all of us.  How do we live in a world where this sort of thing can happen?  How do we face the crises of life, both small and great?  Is there some key to life, some playbook we can get, some list we can follow, some formula we can memorize that will get us through life in one piece, with ourselves and our families living productive and prosperous lives?  What does Jacob's complaint tell us about our relationship to God and the world?

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b><i><h3>John of the Apocalypse</i> by R.P. Nettelhorst</h3></b>  

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If everything in your life went wrong, wouldn’t it be nice if Jesus came and told you why? “Why doesn’t God do something?” It was a question heavy on John’s mind. He had seen all his companions bleed and die; thousands of his compatriots had been slaughtered by a brutal tyranny. It seemed such an odd way for God to treat his most faithful servants. John was just a lonely old man exiled for his beliefs on the island of Patmos. And then Jesus unexpectedly showed up with good news and an explanation.
