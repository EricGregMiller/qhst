Quartz Hill School of Theology is an academic institution designed
to train believers for more effective ministry, both in and out

God, indwelt by the Holy Spirit, not needing any human intermediary
to reach God and competent to judge spiritual matters for him
or herself.

which is associated with the Southern Baptist Convention.
<P>
