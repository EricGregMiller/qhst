<h1><I>How to Read the Bible for All Its Worth: A Guide to Understanding
the Bible</I></h1> by Gordon D. Fee and Douglas Stuart. Grand Rapids:
Zondervan. 1993.  265 pages.  paper. $14.99<HR>

<P>
 This book is being used as a required text in courses we teach
here at Quartz Hill School of Theology, specifically the Bible
Summary course, which is a required by all students.  The book
deals with the issue of how to understand, the Bible.  Although
anyone can understand the Bible, it is easy to make thoughtless
and foolish mistakes in reading it, and this little book can be
a big help in aiding the non-scholar so that he or she does not
make silly errors.  As some wag once wrote, common sense is none
too common; this book attempts to inject a little bit back into
how folks read their Bibles.

 As the authors point out:
<P>
<blockquote> The first reason one needs to learn <I>how</I> to interpret is
that, whether one likes it or not, every reader is at the same
time an interpreter.  That is, most of us assume as we read that
we also understand what we read.  We also tend to think that <I>our
understanding</I> is the same thing as the Holy Spirit's or human
author's <I>intent</I>.  However, we invariably bring to the text
all that we are, with all of our experiences, culture, and prior
understandings of words and ideas.  Sometimes what we bring to
the text, unintentionally to be sure, leads us astray, or else
causes us to read all kinds of foreign ideas into the text. (p.
14)</blockquote>
<P>
 The book is broken down into convenient chapters which give the
reader the basic tools for interpretation, some of the pitfalls
to avoid, and then explains some of the special needs of the various
sorts of material or literary genres that go into making up the
scripture.  The reader must learn to distinguish between poetry
and prose, and learn how to understand both. 
<P>
 As the authors point out:
<P>
 
<blockquote>
 Anyone who has tried, for example, to read through Leviticus,
Jeremiah, or Proverbs, as over against 1 Samuel or Acts, knows
full well that there are many difference.  One can get bogged
down in Leviticus, and who has not felt the frustration of completing
the reading of Isaiah or Jeremiah and then wondering what the
&quot;plot&quot; was?  In contrast, 1 Samuel and the Acts are
especially readable.  We hope to help the reader appreciate these
differences so that he or she can read intelligently and profitably
the nonnarrative parts of the Bible.</blockquote>
<P>
 It is as big a mistake to allegorize something that should be
taken at face value as it is to literalize something that should
be understood as metaphor.  Fee and Stuart have done a fine job
in presenting the basics of reading and understanding the Bible.
 Their book is a short, well-written and easy to understand guide
to basic Bible interpretation.<P>
