<H3><CENTER>You can take any class you want, do all the work,
and you don't have to pay us a dime! </CENTER></H3>

<P>
Of course, if you don't pay, then you won't get a grade, you won't
get any credit, and you won't get any technical help: that is,
we won't answer any questions you might have, and you won't get
any tests to check the progress of your education.
<P>
So, like shareware, if you like it, if it's useful, then why not
pay for it? It's the right thing to do.
<P>
<I>Registration and Cost</I> 
<P>
Registration and payment must be made to receive credit for a
course, though a course may be taken for free for no credit. To
register for the course, e-mail us your name and address.

We will respond with registration materials. Return them to us
with your check or money order made out to <B>Quartz Hill School

<P>
After you register, you will be sent your tests; it will then
be your responsibility to find a proctor (someone to administer
and chaparone) the tests while you take them. This may be your
minister or some other professional, such as a school teacher.
<P>
<I>Credit</I>

units if you register and pass a course. Quartz Hill School of
Theology is recognized by the Association of Christian Schools
International and is authorized to grant CEUs in Bible. <B>IMPORTANT: The school

issue ahead of time with any other institutions to which you may
be planning on transferring.</B><P>

Too often, by simply splitting it into Old and New Testaments,
the unity of the Bible is lost. Consequently, the Bible Survey
courses follow the pattern and classifications of the Hebrew Bible
for the Old Testament, and a new organization for the New Testament.
Each course below is designed to be completed in a single quarter
(ten weeks). Three quarter units or five CEU's may be gained for
each course taken.

(Prerequisite: A knowledge of Hebrew and Greek is essential) This course will introduce the student to the theory and practice of
the textual criticism of the Old and New Testaments.  Textual
criticism is the science which seeks to establish the text which
most closely resembles the original text of a document.  In particular,
Old Testament text criticism attempts to assemble and evaluate
the various readings of the Hebrew text in order to come as close
as possible to what was originally written. 
<P>
Likewise New Testament textual criticism strives to do the same
for the Greek text of the New Testament.  In addition, text criticism
also seeks to understand the history and transmission of the text.
