something to the statement that &quot;The Israelites were not Jews!&quot; That
is, neither were the Judahites <u>J-e-w-s</u>! The people who call themselves <u>J-e-w-s</u>
today are an entirely different race of people from Abraham, Isaac, Jakob, and
the patriarchs of the original 12 Tribes. This fact is also borne out today in
the fact that the people who call themselves <u>J-e-w-s</u> today do not
resemble the White (1 Samuel 17.42 &amp; Psalms 51.7), light-haired, light-eyed
Israelites of old; and genetic studies show that the majority of them are more
genetically kin to the Asiatic Mongoloid than to the Adamic people whom God

the world.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Your friend claims that the
Israelites of the Bible were white, light-haired, light eyed, which means,
assuming I’m following his argument, that based on what Jews look like today
(and all Jews look alike, huh?) that these people claiming to be Jews today
can’t possibly be telling the truth, since they don’t look like that.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And what scriptural passages does your
friend give to demonstrate the appearance of the ancient Israelites?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>1 Samuel 17:42 and Psalm 51:7.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>But I am mystified, since neither of these
passages describes what ancient Israelites looked like:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>So in 1 Samuel, we find out that
Saul thought David unimpressive, that he was just a good-looking little mamma’s
boy as far as he could tell.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I’m not
sure how ruddy translates into telling us what color skin, hair and eyes David
might have had.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And then the passage in
Psalm 51 is even more nonsensical, since David is asking God to forgive him for
committing adultery and murder, using the same imagery as we find in Isaiah
1:18.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And even if you choose to ignore
the context and point of David’s words, I can’t even begin to fathom how one
could get anything from it about what the Israelites looked like.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>In any case, I was puzzled
initially as to what point your friend Phineas Rhinehart was trying to make
with insisting on translating the Greek word <i>Ioudaios</i> as Judahite rather
than Jew.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After all, as Shakespeare
said, a rose would smell as sweet, by any other name.<span style="mso-spacerun:

margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Translators have taken it upon
themselves to <u>translate</u> or <u>transliterate</u> at their leisure, aiding
Satan's great deception by convincing people that those who today call
themselves &quot;Jews&quot; are actually of the same seed-line as the Lord
Jesus Christ! It is an abominable thought!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Well, I’ve got bad news for your
friend. That “abominable thought” is reality: Jesus was a Jew; the people who
call themselves Jews today are descended from Abraham and they are related to
Jesus.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Paul himself argues that case rather
clearly in Romans<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>9:1-5:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

for the sake of my brothers, those of my own race, the people of Israel. Theirs
is the adoption as sons; theirs the divine glory, the covenants, the receiving
of the law, the temple worship and the promises.<span style="mso-spacerun:

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Notice also what he says later in
Romans 11, especially this point in 11:28-32:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span style='mso-bidi-language:HE'>As
far as the gospel is concerned, they are enemies on your account; but as far as
election is concerned, they are loved on account of the patriarchs, for God's
gifts and his call are irrevocable. Just as you who were at one time
disobedient to God have now received mercy as a result of their disobedience,
so they too have now become disobedient in order that they too may now receive
mercy as a result of God's mercy to you. For God has bound all men over to
disobedience so that he may have mercy on them all.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The whole argument over the meaning
of this individual word <i>Ioudaios</i> ignores something that your author
mentions at the very end of his paper: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBlockText>“Proper translation can only be carried out by specific
methods, by the study of words and phrases in their specific and general
contexts, by the study of the particular author and his normal usage of the word
or phrase, by the word or phrase’s extrabiblical usage, and etc.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>So there is
merely a long list of passages in which your author claims that the word Jew
must be replaced with the word Judahite or Judean (and his decision for
translating it as Judahite or Judean seems to be based on which best fits his
anti-Semitic bias), since the biblical people cannot be the same people at all
as the people who today call themselves Jews.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>And why are the Jews of today not the people of the Bible?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Apparently because he has now chosen to call
the people in the Bible Judahites instead of Jews.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Therefore, since the term in the Bible is now different than this
modern designation that’s being used, these people are now proven not to be the
same as the biblical people.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Does this
argument sound a bit circular to you?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Tell me:
how many legs does a horse have?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Four,
right?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Now, for the sake of argument,
lets say that we call the tail of a horse a leg.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>So, given that, how many legs does a horse have?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Five?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Nope.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He still only has
four.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Just because you’ve decided to
call his tail a leg has no bearing on reality. A horse has only four legs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, removing the word “Jew” from the Bible and replacing it
with the word “Judahite” doesn’t much prove a thing as far as I can see,
anymore than choosing to call a rose a thorn bush now means that roses don’t
smell sweet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>And then
there is another inconsistency. 1 Thessalonians 2:14-15 is used to prove that
the Judeans killed Jesus and therefore deserve to be persecuted; and yet, at
the same time, the author tries to prove that the Judeans and Judahites of the
Bible are not the same people as the Jews today.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Sorry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>One cannot have it
both ways. If the Jews of today are not the <i>Ioudaios</i> of the New
Testament, then 1 Thessalonians 2:14-15 cannot be talking about them, can
it?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Of course, the passage is being
taken out of context if one imagines that this passage is justification for
hating the Jewish people.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There’s the
little matter of what Paul argues in Romans 11 to consider, after all, which
may alter one’s understanding just a hair of what he might mean here in 1
Thessalonians.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>You might
notice as you read through the New Testament that Paul uses Jew and Israelite
indiscriminately.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>For example, in
Romans 11:1 Paul writes:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBlockText style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='mso-bidi-language:HE'>I ask then: Did God reject his people? By no
means! I am an Israelite myself, a descendant of Abraham, from the tribe of
Benjamin.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>What is really interesting is what
he then says in Acts 22:3:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBlockText style='mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='mso-bidi-language:HE'>&quot;I am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but
brought up in this city. Under Gamaliel I was thoroughly trained in the law of
our fathers and was just as zealous for God as any of you are today.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>If you notice, Paul uses that Greek
word <i>Ioudaios</i> -- you know, the one that your friend wants to translate
in his idiosyncratic way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Paul claims
to be one, just as in Romans 11:1 he claimed to be a Benjamite.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>So let’s see: Paul is not descended from the
Tribe of Judah.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And he very clearly is
not an inhabitant of Judea, either.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>So
what can we make of this?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Maybe that
your friend is mistaken and that the word Jew is a general term for Israelite?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Notice also
Acts 2, where we are told that a bunch of Jews have gathered together for
Pentecost, and that they are from all over the place; and what does Peter
do?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In Acts 2:22 he addresses them all
as “Men of Israel.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Oh, and then in
2:23 he says that these men of Israel, together with “wicked men” (that is, the
Romans, who actually carried out the execution itself) put Jesus to death.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Think back to that passage in 1
Thessalonians 2:14-15; only Judeans did this?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>But here it says it was “men of Israel”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Of course,
I suppose since the anti-Semites wish to refer to Jews as “Christ killers” that
we should just ignore the fact that the Romans are the ones who actually killed
him; and we should also ignore the fact that, according to Luke 23:34, Jesus
prayed and asked his Father, “forgive them, for they know not what they
do.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He must have been delirious,
right?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Jesus really wants us to hate
them and never forgive them, right?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>That’s what he really meant, huh?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Ah, and
then we should mention something from the Old Testament, just in passing, as we
think about the use of the word Jew.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If
we look at Esther 2:5 it reads this way:</p>

margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:
none'><span style='mso-bidi-language:HE'>Now there was in the citadel of Susa a
Jew of the tribe of Benjamin, named Mordecai son of Jair, the son of Shimei,
the son of Kish,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>I suppose the author was just
confused and didn’t really mean to tell us that Modecai, of the tribe of
Benjamin, was a Jew, since that wouldn’t be accurate, huh?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>And simply changing the word from
Jew to Judahite doesn’t change reality, I’m afraid, any more than calling his
tail a leg suddenly gives a horse five legs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>It is simply an attempt to justify hatred of the Jewish people by
attempting to obscure the fact that the people who are called Jews are the same
people that gave us the Bible and Jesus.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>If one can argue that they really aren’t descended from Abraham, if they
really aren’t Jewish at all, if the Anglo-Saxons are the actual descendents of
Israel, then hatred of the Jews doesn’t violate Genesis 12:1-3 (and other
scriptures).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>And you need to face up to what
this is all about: hatred of a specific group of people because they are that
group of people.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>You are not
successfully sugar coating this.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This
is racism, pure and simple.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If you
chose to hate the Jews, then again, understand very clearly that you are
violating the central point and theme of the Bible: loving God, and loving your
neighbor as yourself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And again, if you
claim to love God, whom you haven’t seen, but hate your neighbor, whom you
have, how can the love of God really be in you?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>It tires me to see the

replacement?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If that were the case,
machine translations would actually make sense.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>I must say that your friend’s use of Strong’s concordance as the
basis for his argument makes me suspicious of his linguistic abilities.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Most scholars I know, myself included, don’t
use Strong’s when we translate, nor do we base our arguments on what
definitions appear in Strong’s dictionary.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>There are a few other materials we might use, like the actual Greek and
Hebrew texts, and oh, perhaps the major lexicons and such.</p>

wrote is “a brilliant piece of scholarly work”.<span style="mso-spacerun:

write things like “<u>J-e-w</u>” and “<u>J-e-w-s</u>”, putting hyphens between
the letters of a common word and underlining it every time instead of just
writing it out normally; they don’t write sections of their paper with red
letters, and they don’t descend to disgusting ridicule like this:</p>

we are to believe that Judah's offspring are <u>J-e-w-s</u>. If that
translation is proper, then in order to be consistent, the offspring of the
tribe of Ephraim, instead of becoming Ephraimites, should become <u>Eews</u>!
Benjamin's offspring should be known as <u>Bews</u> instead of Benjamites!
Instead of Levites, Levi's offspring should become <u>Lews</u>! Simeon's
children would become <u>Sews</u> instead of Simeonites! And Zebulunites would
become <u>Zews</u>!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>And then there is this quoting of 1
John 2:22-23 as if John’s statement, that anyone who denies that Jesus is the
Messiah is a liar and the antichrist, should be applied strictly and solely to
the Jews and their supporters:</p>

be followers of Jesus, but actually aren’t.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

might not even have <i>heard</i> of him at all, one way or the other.<span
