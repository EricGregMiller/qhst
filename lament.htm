<B>The Book of Lamentations</B> 
<P>
<B>I. Title</B> 
<P>
In Hebrew, the title of the book is <I>'ekah</I>, which means
&quot;How&quot;. It is the first word in the book. In the Babylonian
Talmud and other early Jewish writings, the book is referred to
as <I>qinot</I>, which is equivalent to the English word &quot;Lamentations&quot;.
The title in the Greek Septuagint, <I>threnoi</I> and the Latin
Vulgate <I>threni</I> is a translation of the Hebrew name <I>qinot</I>.
It is not uncommon for manuscripts and printed editions to add
the phrase &quot;of Jeremiah&quot; or &quot;of Jeremiah the prophet&quot;.

<B>II. Author and Setting</B> 
<ADDRESS>
A. Author
</ADDRESS>

<P>
Despite the common tradition and the appendations to the title,
the actual author of this short book is unknown. Certainly it
is possible that Jeremiah is the author, though nowhere in the
book itself is the author explicitly identified. However, the
book was apparently written by an eyewitness to the destruction
of the city of Jerusalem by the Babylonians in 586 BC, and the
vocabulary is consistent with that setting and time.
<P>
2 Chronicles 35:25 speaks of Jeremiah singing a lament over Josiah,
who died in 609 BC, and that this lament was written in the book
of Laments. However, there is nothing in the book of Lamentations
that can be construed as referring to the death of Josiah, and
so this reference in 2 Chronicles cannot refer to the biblical
book of Lamentations.
<P>
If the book actually was written by Jeremiah, it seems odd that
in the Hebrew cannon it would be separated from the other book
that bears his name.
<P>
Moreover, there are certain phrases that seem out of character
for Jeremiah to be uttering: for instance in 4:17 the writer laments
that &quot;Moreover, our eyes failed, looking in vain for help;
from our towers we watched for a nation that could not save us.&quot;
This seems contradictory to Jeremiah's rather strident hostility
toward reliance on foreign help. (cf. Jeremiah 2:18 and 37:5-10).
<P>
However, those who believe Jeremiah was the author find no incompatibility
between such phrases and the prophet's authorship.

B. Setting
</ADDRESS>

<P>
Apparently it was composed shortly after the destruction of Jerusalem
and the temple by Nebuchadnezzar. Read 2 Kings 25:8-12 for background.

C. Literary Matters
</ADDRESS>

<P>
It is interesting to notice that the five poems that make up the
book of Lamentations are acrostics -- that is, the successive
verses in some way are shaped by the Hebrew alphabet. Chapters
one and two are relatively simple, in which each stanza has three
lines. The first word of each stanza begins with a successive
letter of the Hebrew alphabet. Chapter four has twenty- two stanzas
of two lines, each of which begins with a successive letter of
the alphabet. Chapter three is more elaborate, in that the stanzas
have three lines, and each line begins with the same letter of
the Hebrew alphabet. Therefore, the first stanza has three lines,
each beginning with <I>aleph</I>; the second stanza has three
lines, each beginning with <I>beth</I>, and so forth.
<P>
The fifth chapter of Lamentations is not an acrostic in the strict
sense, but interestingly enough, it is written in twenty-two lines,
which corresponds to the number of letters in the Hebrew alphabet.
