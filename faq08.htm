<center><h1><B>8. Is Masturbation a Sin?</B></h1></center>
<P>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The only mention of masturbation in the Bible would possibly be
Lev.  15:16-18, 32-33; 22:4 and Deut. 23:10-11.  It is interesting
to notice that none of these passages refer to the emission of
semen as a sin.  In fact, such an emission has fewer consequences than a woman's
menstruation.  <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I would conclude, therefore, that masturbation
is not a sin and is no more regulated in the Bible than relieving
oneself or menstruating.  This is unsurprising, since the overwhelming
majority of human beings do masturbate at some point in their
lives (and the rest, someone once said, are lying); if it was a sin, then, it seems
to me, it would have been mentioned.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thus, I tell people if they don't feel guilty about doing it,
then it is not a problem. On the other hand, if they <i>do</i> feel guilty, then perhaps
they shouldn't.  The principles of Romans 14 come into play: on
matters of individual conscience, if the conscience is not clear, then for that individual it <i>is</i> a sin.
