<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<P>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Epistle to the Romans is, historically speaking, the most
significant text in the Bible.  It was the foundation stone of
Augustine's theology.  It was the bedrock of Luther's reform.
 It was the text of choice among the dialectical theologians of
the early 20th century.  It continues to speak to Christians of
every age and every circumstance.
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The lectures which follow are designed to address the Greek text
of the book.  The notes following the verses are textual in nature.
 For the theological significance of the book and its introductory
matters the student is referred to the commentary by K&auml;semann.
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In textual studies certian manuscripts are more significant than
others.  Following is a list of  Uncial manuscripts that have
been consulted in this textual investigation (along with others).
 This list is merely representative and not exhaustive.  Its purpose
here is to give the student some idea of the wide attestation
of the text of Romans: P10, P26, P27, P31, P40, P46, P61, <FONT FACE="SPTiberian">)</FONT>, C,
048, 0172, 0209, 0219, 0220, 0221.
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the text that follows, the textual base is the edition of
Westcott and Hort.  The student is required to collate (compare)
this text with the text of Nestle-Aland 27.  To do this the student
need merely compare, word for word, the text found following and
the text printed in Nestle, noting all variations, no matter how
small.  I do no comment on every variant in what follows; only
the more significant.  But, again, the student is required to
note <I>every</I> variant.
