<B>The Book of Malachi</B> 
<P>
<B>I. Title</B> 
<P>
The title is the same in Hebrew as it is in the English and Greek
translations. Malachi is not likely the name of the author of
the book; it means simply &quot;my messenger&quot; and occurs
in Malachi 1:1 and 3:1; in three one it is simply translated,
instead of being treated like a proper name.
<P>
<B>II. Author and Setting</B> 
<ADDRESS>
A. Author
</ADDRESS>

<P>
Based on Mark 1:2-3, Malachi was actually written by the prophet
Isaiah.  See the discussion on <A HREF="zecharia.htm">Zechariah</A>
for more explanation.
<P>
Isaiah was the son of Amoz. Nothing is known about his father,
Amoz, beyond his name. Isaiah mentions two sons in the book of
Isaiah: Maher- shalal-hash-baz, which means &quot;Hasten spoil,
quick booty&quot; and She'ar-Yashub, which means &quot;a remnant
shall remain&quot;. Isaiah prophesied mainly in Jerusalem. Based
on his vocabulary usage and style, it seems clear that Isaiah
was very well educated. According to Jewish tradition found in
the Mishna, Manasseh stuck Isaiah in a hollow tree and then sawed
him in half as punishment for opposing him (cf. Hebrews 11:37).
<ADDRESS>
B. Historical Setting
</ADDRESS>

<P>
Isaiah received prophesies and committed them to writing over
the years 740 to 690 BC. At the same time he was prophesying in
Judah, Amos and Hosea were busy in the Northern Kingdom of Israel;
Micah was writing in the south. Isaiah's prophetic work was composed
during the reigns of the following kings (see 2 Kings 15:8-21:18):
<P>
<B>Judah / Israel</B> 
<P>
Uzziah (Azariah) 792-740 / Jehoash 798-782
<P>
Jotham 750-732 / Jereboam II 793-753
<P>
Zechariah 753
<P>
Shallum 752
<P>
Menahem 752-742
<P>
Pekah 752-732
<P>
Pekahiah 742-740
<P>
Hoshea 732-723
<P>
Ahaz 735-715 (ISRAEL TAKEN CAPTIVE)
<P>
Hezekiah 715-686
<P>
Manasseh 696-642
<ADDRESS>
C. Political Situation
</ADDRESS>

<P>
1. Assyria was gaining momentum and strength in the west as a
major world power. In Isaiah's lifetime, the Northern Kingdom
of Israel, as a separate political entity, came to an end. Tiglath-Pileser
III invaded Gilead and the Northern Kingdom in 734; its capital,
Samaria, finally fell between 724- 722 BC.
<P>
2. Sennacherib invaded Judah, the Southern Kingdom, in 701 BC.
<ADDRESS>
D. Spiritual Situation
</ADDRESS>

<P>
Degeneracy and official sanction of idolatry in Judah during the
reigns of Ahaz and Manasseh only encouraged an already existing
problem. Although Hezekiah instituted reforms, both the common
people, as well as the upper classes, continued to be attracted
to false gods.
<ADDRESS>
E. Economic Situation
</ADDRESS>

<P>
Isaiah lived during a period of great prosperity, especially at
the beginning of his ministry. However, this prosperity was concentrated
in the upper classes, who had a tendency to be stingy and oppressive
in handling their wealth.
