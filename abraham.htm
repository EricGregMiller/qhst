<B>ABRAHAM</B> 
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Throughout the Old Testament, and especially the New Testament,
the name of Abraham stands for the representative man of faith.
Look at Romans 4:<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather, discovered
in this matter? If, in fact, Abraham was justified by works, he
had something to boast about--but not before God.  What does the
Scripture say?<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE><p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now when a man works, his wages are not credited to him as a gift,
but as an obligation. However, to the man who does not work but
trusts God who justifies the wicked, his faith is credited as
righteousness.  David says the same thing when he speaks of the
blessedness of the man to whom God credits righteousness apart
from works: <p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;Blessed are they <BR>
whose transgressions are forgiven, <BR>
whose sins are covered. <BR>
Blessed is the man <BR>
whose sin the Lord will never count against him.&quot; 
</BLOCKQUOTE><p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Is this blessedness only for the circumcised, or also for the
uncircumcised? We have been saying that Abraham's faith was credited
to him as righteousness.  Under what circumstances was it credited?
Was it after he was circumcised, or before? It was not after,
but before!  And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal
of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So then, he is the father of all who believe but have not been
circumcised, in order that righteousness might be credited to
them.  And he is also the father of the circumcised who not only
are circumcised but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith
that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised. 
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was not through law that Abraham and his offspring received
the promise that he would be heir of the world, but through the
righteousness that comes by faith.  For if those who live by law
are heirs, faith has no value and the promise is worthless,  because
law brings wrath. And where there is no law there is no transgression.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Therefore, the promise comes by faith, so that it may be by grace
and may be guaranteed to all Abraham's offspring--not only to
those who are of the law but also to those who are of the faith
of Abraham. He is the father of us all.  As it is written: &quot;I
have made you a father of many nations.&quot; He is our father
in the sight of God, in whom he believed--the God who gives life
to the dead and calls things that are not as though they were.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Against all hope, Abraham in hope believed and so became the father
of many nations, just as it had been said to him, &quot;So shall
your offspring be.&quot;  Without weakening in his faith, he faced
the fact that his body was as good as dead--since he was about
a hundred years old--and that Sarah's womb was also dead.  Yet
he did not waver through unbelief regarding the promise of God,
but was strengthened in his faith and gave glory to God, being
fully persuaded that God had power to do what he had promised.
 This is why &quot;it was credited to him as righteousness.&quot;
 The words &quot;it was credited to him&quot; were written not
for him alone, but also for us, to whom God will credit righteousness--for
us who believe in him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead.
 He was delivered over to death for our sins and was raised to
life for our justification.

<blockquote><h3><b><I>I. Abraham in the frame of contemporary history:</I></b></h3></blockquote> 
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Despite the discovery of numerous inscriptions in the Ancient
Near East, we have no references to the patriarch Abraham outside
the biblical accounts.  In fact, it is difficult for most scholars
to even affix a precise date for his life. 
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Generally, though, scholars place Abraham's migration from Ur
somewhere between 1900 and 1750 BC.  Here are some factors to
consider in arriving at a date:
<P>
<B> A. The Biblical Date of Abraham's Migration from Ur.</B> 
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;According to scattered chronological notices given mainly in the
books of Genesis and Exodus, Abraham left Mesopotamia (Haran)
on his way to Palestine about 645 years before the Israelites
left Egypt.  This figure is made up of the actual patriarchal
period (Abraham-Jacob) consisting of 215 years, plus the Egyptian
sojourn which lasted 430 years. 
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The period of 215 years as the duration of the patriarchal period
in Palestine is arrived at from the following biblical data: 
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;According to Genesis 12:4, Abraham was seventy-five years old
when he left Haran.  According to Genesis 21:5, he was &quot;one
hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born unto him.&quot;
 Since Isaac was &quot;sixty years old&quot; when Jacob was born
(Genesis 25:26) and Jacob was &quot;a hundred and thirty years
old&quot; when he stood before the Pharaho of Egypt (Genesis 47:9),
the total is found by adding 25 years for Abraham, 60 years for
Isaac, and 130 years for Jacob, giving 215 years as the length
of the period from Abraham's arrival in the country until Jacob's
exit from it.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;According to Exodus 12:40-41, the entire period of Israel's sojourn
in Egypt was 430 years.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The LXX at this point reads 215 years for the Egyptian sojourn,
so that is a possible variance in our dating.  But compare Genesis
15:13 and Acts 7:6.  Of course, the 400 years might be constructed
by adding together the patriarchal period and the 215 years of
captivity as given by the LXX. 
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If we go with the Hebrew text, however, the patriarchs spent about
215 years in Canaan, and the Israelites 430 years in Egypt.  Abraham,
accordingly, entered Canaan 645 years before the Exodus (or 415
if we follow the LXX). <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If we accept the synchronism of 1 Kings 6:1, which places the
Exodus 480 years before the fourth year of Solomon's reign (which
we know to be about 961 BC), we have a date of the Exodus in 1441
BC.  That would place Abraham's entrance into Canaan at 2086 BC,
and his birth at 2161 BC, since he was seventy-five years old
when he left Haran for Canaan (Genesis 12:4).  The Patriarchal
period, then, would extend from 2086 BC to 1871 BC, and the Egyptian
sojourn from 1871 to 1441 BC.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If we reject the synchronism of 1 Kings 6:1 and read the 480 as
being short hand for twelve generations (12x40 = 480), then we
can perhaps argue that a generation more realistically is only
twenty years, so that puts the Exodus at about 1290 BC.  Thus,
Abraham then entered Palestine about 1935 BC, he was born about
2010 BC.  If we use the LXX dates for the Egyptian sojourn, then
Abraham entered Palestine about 1720 and was born about 1795.
<P>
<B> B. Ur</B>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Going with the Early dates, Abraham was born under the new Sumero-Akkadian
Empire of Ur-Nammu, the founder of the Third Dynasty of Ur (c.
2135-2025 BC).  Ur-Nammu took the title &quot;King of Sumer and
Akkad&quot;; his mightiest work was the erection of the great
ziggurat at Ur, which remains the best preserved of all monuments
of this type.  The Hebrew patriarch accordingly would have emigrated
from the famous city when it was just entering its heyday of power
and prestige, with a dynasty that lasted over a century.  He would,
moreover, be leaving Haran for Canaan when his native city had
reached the height of its influence in southern Mesopotamia. 
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The patriarchal age, in Palestine, would, on the other hand, witness
numerous smaller Elamite and Amorite states in Mesopotamia with
Elamite princes at Isin and Larsa, and Amorites at Eshnunna, who
between 2100 and 1800 BC took over the heritage of the Third Dynasty
of Ur after its collapse and the subsequent destruction of the
capital city, Ur. <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Egypt, during the patriarchal period in Palestine was powerful;
it was the time of the strong Middle Kingdom, under the Twelth
Dynasty (2000-1780 BC).  Joseph became prime minister of, and
Jacob stood before, one of the powerful pharaohs of this dynasty
(Amenemes I-IV or Senworsret I-III). 
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Israel, moreover, was in Egypt during the Hyksos period of foreign
domination (1780-1546 BC), was oppressed by the great Thutmose
III (1482-1450 BC) of the New Kingdom (18th dynasty) and left
the country of Egypt during the reign of Amenhotep II (1450-1425
BC). 
<P>
<B>Ur in the Abrahamic Era. </B>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Old Testatment is quite clear in its statement that Abraham's
home was originally in lower Mesopotamia, specifically the city
of Ur, and that he subsequently emigrated to Haran in upper Mesopotamia
on his way to Canaan (Gen. 11:28-31; 12:1-4; 15:7; Neh. 9:7).
 Singularly enough, Abraham's native city is referred to not simply
as Ur in the Old Testament (Gen. 11:31, etc.) but Ur of the Chaldees.
 The qualifying phrase &quot;of the Chaldees&quot; is not an anachronism
as many critics hold, but simply a later gloss to explain to a
subsequent age, when Ur and its location had vanished, that the
city was located in southern Babylonia. 
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The polytheistic eastern ancestry of the Hebrews is indicated
in Joshua 24:2.  There is the story told in the Talmud, of when
little Abraham was six or seven, his father left him in charge
of his idol shop while he went out to conduct some business. 
When his father got home, he discovered to his horror that all
the idols had been smashed, but one -- the big one in the center,
who was holding a stick in its hands. 
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Abraham, what have you done?&quot; demanded his father.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I?  Nothing.  The Big idol got angry and smashed all the
little idols.&quot; 
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Don't take me for a fool, son.  Idols don't get up and walk
around, they don't breathe, they don't eat and they don't move
-- and they certainly can't smash anything.&quot; 
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Then why do you bother worshipping them?&quot; 
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This idolatrous environment out of which the Hebrew patriarchs
came has been illuminated by the excavations at Ur.  Until 1854
the site was completely unknown, as far as it being the location
of the ancint city of Ur.  The Arabs called the spot al Muqayyar,
&quot;the mound of Bitumin&quot;.  In that year of 1854, J.E.
Taylor conducted some simple excavations there which yeilded cylinders
stating that Nabonidus of Babylon (556-539 BC) had there restored
the ancient ziggurat of Ur-Nammu.  Further excavations by H.R.
Hall in 1918 and notably by C.L. Wolley from 1922-1934, have made
Ur one of the best-known ancient sites of souther Babylonia and
have revealed that it was one of the largest and wealthiest cities
of that area, particularly at the time biblical chronology suggests
Abraham left it with his father. 
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The ziggurat of Ur-Nammu of Abraham's day was probably erected
on top of a smaller structure which may have been as old as the
reign of Mes-Anne-padda of the First Dynasty of Ur (c. 2800-2600
BC).  But its upper part was the work of Nabonidus.  The bulk
of the great artificial mountain, however, had been constructed
by Ur-Nammu, and his name and title were discovered stamped on
the bricks.  The tower was a solid mass of brickwork, 200 feet
long, 150 feet wide and about 70 feet high.  The facing, covering
the inner core of unbaked brick, consisted of baked brick set
in btumen, eight feet in thickness. 
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The ziggurat was thus a mountain of brickwork, a &quot;high place&quot;
or artificial hill made by men who had once worshipped gods on
mountain tops -- or so it is supposed.  Finding nothing of the
sort of this flat alluvial plain, they had set to work to build
one.  The called it &quot;the hill of heaven&quot; or the &quot;mountain
of God&quot;.  They planted trees and shrubs on its stages, in
imitation of the real hills of their native home.  The whole design
was a masterpiece, the lines of the walls being built on calculated
curves to give the appearance of lightness and strength. 
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Originally the shrine of Nannar, the moon god, stood on the upermost
stage, for Ur was dedicated to this deity.  Numerous other gods
were worshipped in Babylonia, but at Ur Nannar was supreme.  Other
deities might have their temples, but at Ur a whole quarter of
the city was set apart for him.  He was called &quot;the Exalted
Lord&quot;, the &quot;crown of Heaven and Earth&quot;, &quot;the
Beautiful Lord who Shines in Heaven&quot;, and similar epithets.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The city walls enclosed a rough oval comprising an area some two
and a half miles in circuit.  Within this tract in the the northwest
part, was a second enclosure, consisting of a rectangular space
about four hundred yards in lenghth and approximately two hundred
yards in width.  This was the TEMENOS or sacred area of Nannar.
 Originally it was a platform raised above the general level of
the town.  But gradually it had been dwarfed by the  constant
rise of the residential district, where dilapidation and reconstriction
upon preceding debris and ruins were much more common than in
the carefully kept temple enclosure. 
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The great wall that encircled the sacred precinct rose high above
its surroundings and set off the TEMENOS as a holy place. 
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nannar was not only the god of Ur, but also he was its king. 
So it was fitting that his house should be the city's ultimate
stronghold.  It was indeed designed as an inner fortress, but
it was nonetheless the temple of the moon good.  Moreover, the
walled platform or temenos was the moon god's terrace and on it
stood also the ziggurat, the chief splendor of the city and the
center of its cult.  On its uppermost stage was the shrine of
Nannar containing the statue of the god and his bedchamber. 
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In front of the ziggurat, set between its stairways, were twin
temples, the day houses of the moon god and his consort, the goddess
Nin-Gal, in which were the shrines of the lesser gods who formed
their retinue.  Abutting these were the sacred kitchens where
the daily food of the gods (eaten by their eartly representatives)
offered in connection with their worship, was prepared. 
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In front of the ziggurat and on a lower level was a large open
court surrounded by many chambers, which was a sort of market
place where the populous of the city and surrounding country brought
their gifts and paid thier taxes to the moon god, for Nannar was
the great landlord of his people.  He owned their farms, their
shops, and their wealth.  Their gifts and payments were in kind,
and were recorded on wet clay tablets and deposited in the archives
of the temple. <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The ziggurat and the open court at its base however, did not take
up all the area of the TEMENOS.  On one side of the court arose
another temple called &quot;the House of Great Plenty&quot;. 
This was the harem, as it were, of the moon god.  Here, in twin
shrines, one devoted to Nannar and the other to his spouse, a
secret ritual was conducted.  In the adjacent apartments were
housed the priestess-prostitutes.  The House of great Pleanty
(what we would call a Whore House) faced the Sacred Way, a broad
thoroughfare running through the TEMENOS from northeast to southeast.
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Sumerian Temple was much more than a place of &quot;worship&quot;.
 The sacred area of Ur with its multitudinous activities was like
a monastery in the Middle Ages.  Arranged around a building called
&quot;the Great House of Tablets&quot; were factories, workshops,
and offices.  In a theocratic state the moon god was king as well
as god.  He needed civil servants as well as priests.  Much of
the activity in the TEMENOS was devoted to the secular business
of the priesthood and doubtless the worship of Nannar at Ur, like
the worship of Caesar Augustus at Rome, was a demonstration of
loyalty to the state rather than the expression of religious need.
 But that did not diminish its importance.  &quot;We have to think
of Ur in Abraham's time as dominated by a cult the essense of
which was its material magnificence, a cult absolutely inseparable
from the city.&quot;
<P>
<blockquote><h3><I><b>II. Abraham at Haran and in Canaan.</b></I></h3> </blockquote>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Despite the remarkable discoveries made in the course of the systematic
excavations at Ur, especially the royal tombs, no direct evidence
has been found of Abraham's residence there, and such evidence
could scarecely be expected, since Ur was very large and Terah
and his sons inconspicuous citizens who emigrated from it.  However,
the case is quite different in the region of Haran to which the
patriarch went.  In this region of northwest Mesopotamia there
is unmistakable evidence of the extended Hebrew residence in the
vicinity of the Balikh and Habur rivers, two tributaries of the
Euphrates east of the great bend south of ancient Carchemish.
<P>
<B>A. Abraham's Sojourn at Haran:</B> 
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The town of Haran (Gen. 11:31; 12:5) is still in existence on
the Balikh River sixty miles west of Tell Halaf.  It was a flourishing
city in the nineteenth and eighteenth centuries BC, as is known
from frequent references to it in cuneiform sources.  The name
appears in Assyrian documents as Harranu (road) likely because
here the trade route from Damascus joined the highway from Nineveh
to Carchemish.  Sinularly enough, like Ur, Abraham's birthplace,
it was also the seat of worship of the moon god from very ancient
times.  Whether Terah chose Haran as a place to settle because
he had not broken with his idolatry, or perhaps from commercial
reasons, can, of course, only be guessed at. <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The city of Nahor, which was Rebekkah's home (Gen. 24:10), occurs
often as Nakhur in the Mari tablets, discovered in 1935 and dating
from the eighteenth century BC.  To judge from the Mari references
and Assyrian records of the seventh century BC, where Nahor occurs
as Til-Nakhiri (the Mound of Nahor), it seems to have been located
in the Balikh Valley below Haran.  Beside the definite location
of the patriarchal cities Haran and Nahor in northwestern Mesopotamia,
hardly less clear indications of Hebrew residence in this region
appear in the names of Abraha's forefathers, which correspond
tothe names of towns near Haran: Serug (Assyrian Sarugi), Nahor,
and Terah (Til Turakhi, &quot;Mound of Terah&quot;, inAssyrian
times).  Other immediate ancestors and relatives of Abraham listed
in Genesis 11:10-30 have left traces in this territory, called
Paddan-Aram (Aramaic <I>paddana</I>, the field or plain of Aram)
in Genesis 25:20, 26:6-7, and so on.  Reu also corresponds to
later names of towns in the Middle-Euphrates valley.  Peleg, for
example, recalls later Paliga on the Euphrates, just above the
mouth of the Habur.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Beside definite geographical links between the Hebrew patriarchs
and their earlier residence in northwest Mesopotamia, a number
of the early patriarchal narratives indicate a formative influence
from this region.  Terah not only died in Haran (Gen. 11:31-32)
from which city Abram then migrated to Canaan (Gen. 12:4), but
a wife for Isaac was fetched from &quot;the city of Nahor&quot;
(Gen. 24:10).  Jacob fled to Haran (Gen. 27:43) from Esau's wrath,
and he lived in Paddan-Aram at least twenty years while in Laban's
employ (Gen. 29:1-31:55).
<P>
<B>B. Abraham in Canaan.</B> 
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At the age of seventy-five and after the death of Terah, Abraham
left Haran and came into Canaan (Gen. 12:4-5).  In this age Palestine
was still thinly poplulated.  Linguistically the bulk of its inhabitants
belonged to the same family as the Hebrews, though their racial
composition and cultural traditions were different.  Virtually
all the Canaanite towns were then located in the Coastal Plain,
the Plain of Esdraelon, and the Valley of the Jordan and of the
Dead Sea. <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As Albright wrote, <p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The hill country was in the main still unoccupied by sendentary
population, so the biblical tradition is absolutely correct in
making the patriarchs wander over the hills of central Palestine
and the dry lands of the south, where there was still pleanty
of room for them.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This general stituation which prevailed in the Middle Bronze
Age (c. 2200-1550 BC) in Palestine is in thorough agreement with
the semi-nomadic life of the patriarchs as pictured in the Genesis
narratives.  On the other hand it is completely out of perspective
for a later period, particularly after 1200 BC, and its origin
as a late invention would be most difficult to explain. 
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the Bronze Age the mountains of Palestine were heavily forested
on the watershed ridge and the western slope, so that there was
little arable land.  Cisterns, moreover, had not then come into
general use.  Consequently there were no settlements except where
good springs are located just under a low hill, suitable for defense,
with meadows or valleys near at hand, to insure a supply of food.
 Between such fortiefied towns, most of which were located on
the watershed ridge or near it, there was plenty of room for semi-nomadic
tribes, whose existence is attested by the remains of Middle and
Late Bronze Age pottery in cemeteries whihc were too far from
towns to have been used by the sedentary population. 
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It is significant, too, in this connection that the topographical
allusions in the patriarchal stories fit the archaelogical indications
of the Middle Bronze Age (c. 2200-1550 BC) extremely well.  In
fact, so many corroberations of detail have come to light in the
last several decades that &quot;most competent scholars have given
up the old critical theory according to which the stories of the
patriarchs are mostly retrojections from the time of the Dual
Monarchy (9th-8th c. BC).  For instance, places which appear in
connection with the movements of the patriarchs are not the towns
and holy sites of later periods, such as Mizpah or Gibeahk, but
are nearly all known from recent archaelogical explorations to
have been inhabited in the patriarchal age, such as Shechem, Bethel,
Dothan, Gerar, Jerusalem (Salem) and Bersheba.  Hebron, however,
as a city, was not in existence in Abraham's day.  It was not
founded until &quot;seven years before Zoan in Egypt&quot; (Num.
13:22), that is, about 1700 BC.  Earlier, the site was called
Mamre, and the mention of Hebron (Gen. 13:18, 23:19) is an explanatory
note by Moses (or later editor) to indicate where Mamre was. 
<P>
<B>Sodom and Gomorrah</B>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The five cities of the plain (circle) of the Jordan -- Sodom,
Gomorrah, Admah, Zeboiim and Zoar, also belong to the early patriarchal
age.  The biblical notice that the district of the Jordan, where
these cities were located, was exceedingly fertile and well-peopled
around 2065 BC, but that not long afterwards was abandoned, are
in full accord with the archaeological facts.  It is now known
that these cities were situated in the Vale of Siddim (Gen. 14:3),
and it used to be believed that this was the area at the southern
end of the Dead Sea, now covered with water.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the September/October 1980 issue of <I>Biblical Archaeology
Review</I>, it was reported that Walter E. Rast of Valparaiso
University in Valparaiso, Indiana and R. Thomas Schaub of the
University of Pennsylvania, were excavating two sites near the
eastern shore of the Dead Sea in Jordan, which they believe are
prime candidates for the Biblical cities destroyed because of
their wickedness. 
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The principle site is a place called Bab edh-Dhra, less than one
mile east of the Lisan, the tongue-like peninsula that protrudes
into the Dead Sea on the eastern shore.  While surveying the area
around Bab edh-Dhra, Rast and Schaub discovered the second site,
Numeira, in 1973.  Even without excavation, the archaeologists
could see that the site had been burned.  Spongy charcoal was
all over the ground and could be scooped up by hand.  Pottery
sherds found on the site's surface easily dated Numeira to the
Early Bronze Age (c. 3200-2200 BC), the same period that Bab edh-Drah
was inhabited. 
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Located seven miles south of Bab edh-Dhra, Numeira is a mere two-acre
site.  Excavations have revealed a number of domestic installations
and the existence of some local industry including winemaking.
 The preservation of a large batch of grapes with skins still
on -- found in what may have been a winery -- seems almost miraculous.
 The remains of a tower from which the inhabitants could have
been warned of approaching danger was also uncovered: a flight
of plaster lined stairs leading to the upper part of the tower
was preserved. 
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In their systematic survey of the area, Rast and Schaub also found
three other sites -- all showing signs of habitation during the
Early Bronze Age -- strung along a line south of Bab edh-Dhra
and Numeira.  These three sites, Safi, Feifa, and Khanazir, like
Bab edh-Dhra and Numeira, overlook the Southern Ghor, the circular
plain or flatland along the southeast shore of the Dead Sea. 
these other three sites have yet to be excavated, however. 
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That there are five, and only five sites located in the Dead Sea
area -- each located near a flowing spring; that all five date
to the same archaeological period -- the Early Bronze Age; and
that there is no other evidence of occupation in the area until
the Roman period over 2000 years later, is not without significance.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Before their destruction, Sodom and Gomorrah had been part of
a coalition of five cities which had rebelled against their overlord.
 The rebellion was suppressed and Lot, who lived in Sodom, was
taken captive.  When Abram heard this, he took an army of 318
men, rescued Lot and defeated the armies that previously had fought
agains the coalition of five cities (Gen. 14). 
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;These five biblical cities are generally referred to as the Cities
of the Plain.  In addition to Sodom and Gomorrah, they are Admah,
Zeboiim, and Bella (or Zoar): Gen. 14:2.  Geographical references
in Genesis 14 seem to suggest that the five cities were located
in the Dead Sea area (14:3). 
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Many people, even W.F. Albright, have speculated that the shallow,
southern end of the Dead Sea was once dry land and that Sodom
and Gomorrah might have been located there. 
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In recent years the level of the Dead Sea has dropped considerably
because of the water that has been drained from the Jordan River
to the north, whicch empties into the Dead Sea.  During the summer
of 1979, a large part of the Dead Sea's southern basin became
exposed.  Rast and Schaub took the opportunity to examine and
explore the southern floor of the Dead Sea.  Their conclusion:
&quot;The south end (of the Dead Sea) could not have contained
cities at any time during the historical period, at least from
3000 BC onward.&quot;  According to these archaeologists, &quot;This
area would have been not only an improbable, but also an impossible
area in which to establish a city.&quot; 
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The town of Bab edh-Dhra was destroyed at the end of the Early
Bronze III period (about 2400 BC), apparently.  The foundations
of some of the buildings were buried under tons of rubble.  Beneath
the rubble, there is clear evidence of a fiery conflagration.
 Some Early Bronze IV structures were also found, perhaps built
by those who destroyed the Early Bronze III city.   And then,
nothing. 
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At the other three sites, Safi, Feifa, and Khanazir, there have
been no excavations.  An interesting sidelight about Safi is its
identification on a famous mosaic map in Madab, an hour's drive
away.  The Madab map was found on the floor of a 6th century AD
Byzantine churhc.  On it, Safi is identified as Zoar, one of the
five Cities of the Plain. <BR>
The unexcavated town of Feifa appears to be very similar to Bab
edh-Dhra.  Even surface evidence reflects the fact that the city
was destroyed in a fiery disaster.  Spongy charcoal can still
be scooped from the surface by hand, just like at Numeira. 
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fifth site, Khanazir, is at the extreme southern end of the
Ghor, just before entering the Arabah, the great valley that extends
from the Ghor to the gulf of Aqabah in the Red Sea.  Although
a wall clearly encircled the site -- it is difficult to tell more
without excavation. 
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There is much to be learned from these sites, still.  The possibilities
are especially intriguing because of the recent heated debate
as to whether towns named Sodom, Gomorrah, Zoar, and perhaps other
Cities of the Plain are mentioned in the Ebla tablets, which also
date from the mid-third millenium. 
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This lends support to an early date for Abraham, rather than a
late date.  In fact, if the dating of these sites is accurate,
it is possible that Abraham must be dated to an even earlier time
than the biblical data would at first suggest.
<P>
<B>THE PATRIARCHAL NARRATIVES AND ARCHAEOLOGY</B> 
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As a result of archaeological research, particularly that of the
last six or seven decades, a large quantity of inscriptional material
is now available to scholars, which has an importan bearing on
the patriarchal age. 
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This material is of the greatest importance.  The bulk is not
yet published (archaeologists are notoriously slow about publishing),
but what has been published and analyzed has had a mementous role
in dealing a fatal blow to radical critical theories and in complelling
a greater respect for the historical worth of the patriarchal
naratives.  This is not to say that the new material has in some
way proved the accuracy of the Old Testament narratives (they
don't need that), but they have furnished a great deal of background
material, showing that the stories in Genesis fit into the background
of that age, and that customs which appear in the stories were
customs which prevailed in the world in which the patriarchs found
themselves.
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B> 1. Abraham and the Discoveries at Nuzi:</B> 
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nuzi was excavated between 1925 and 1941.  It is located southeast
of Nineveh, not far from modern Kirkuk, and it has yielded several
thousand documents.  These tablets provide numerous illustations
of the customs which figure in the patriarchal narratives.  The
people of Nuzi (or Nuzu) were Hurrians (the Horites of the KJV)
Old Testament. 
<P>
<B>ADOPTION</B>:<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At Nuzi, a childless couple frequently adopted
a freeborn person or a slave to look after them when they grew
old, bury them when they died, and inherit their property.  Abraham,
who had no prospect of any children of his own, refers to Eliezer
as his heir, and calls him &quot;son of my house&quot;, that is,
his heir presumptive; look at Gen. 15:2:<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But Abram said, &quot;O Sovereign LORD, what can you give me since
I remain childless and the one who will inherit my estate (literally
&quot;son of aquisition of my house is he&quot;) is Eliezer of
Damascus?&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Presumably Abraham had legally adopted this slave in accordance
with prevailing custom, to the mutual advantage of both.  But
the divine word to Abram is &quot;this man will not be your heir&quot;
(Gen. 15:4).  If he was a legally adopted heir, how could his
rights be set aside as long as he fulfilled his filial duties?
 The Nuzi texts give the answer.  There, provision is made that
if the adopter should afterward beget a son of his own, the adopted
son must yield to him the place of the chief heir. 
<P>
<B>MARRIAGE LAWS:</B>  
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nuzi marital customs illustrate Sarah's action in giving her Egyptian
servant Hagar to her husband as her substitute when she despaired
of becoming a mother herself (Gen. 16:1-16).  Later, Rachel follows
the same course with her servant Bilhah and her example is followed
by Leah, but for a different reason (Gen. 30:3, 9).  Nuzi marriage
regulations stipulate that if a wife is barren, she must furnish
her husband with a slave wife. 
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Later, when Sarah had herself given birth to Isaac, and demanded
that Hagar and her child should be expelled and disinherited,
the patriarchs reluctance to comply with her demand is readily
understandable in the light of common practice at Nuzi.  There,
the law provides that in the event the slave wife should bear
a son, that son must not be expelled.  It is clear, in the light
of Nuzian parallels, why Abram was reluctant to agree to Sarah's
illegal demand, and doubtless would have refused to do so, had
not God overridden the human law. 
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This points out how God was working with Abram, teaching him to
trust him, and also teaching him that God's law takes precedence
over human law, and that God will not always operate within human
expectations.  God says, &quot;you will have an heir&quot;, so
he adopts his slave, thinnking he has fulfilled God's will.  Then
God makes it clear that was not what he meant, that the heir would
be a son born to him.  Then he takes Hagar and has a son through
him and God has to come and say, no that's not waht I meant either.
 People never expect miracles. 
<P>
<B>RIGHTS OF PRIMOGENITURE:</B>  
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Esau's sale of his birthright (Gen. 25:27-34) is also illustrated.
 At Nuzi, a legal arrangement existed whereby the privileges of
the firstborn were transferred to another. 
<P>
<B>THE TERAPHIM (IDOLS):</B>  
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Rachel's theft of Laban's teraphim (Gen. 31:34) is much better
understood in the light of the Nuzi evidence.  Apparently the
possession of these household gods implied leadership of the family
and in the case of a married daughter, assured her husband the
right to the property of her father.  Since Laban evidently had
sons of his own when Jacob left for Canaan, they alone had the
right to their father's gods, and the theft of these idols by
Rachel was a serious offence (Gen. 31:19, 30, 35), aimed at preserving
for her husband the chief title to Laban's estate. <BR>
It is of the greatest importance to note that in these cases customs
are interwoved in the narratives which do not recur in the Old
Testament in later periods.  Concerning the patriarchal stories,
H.H. Rowley wrote:<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Their accurate reflection of social conditions in the patriarchal
age and in some parts of the Mesopotamia from which the patriarchs
are said to have come many centuries before the present documents
were composed is striking.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But the fact that the patriarchal narratives correctly reflect
customs that would long since have become obsolete in the age
when the critics content these documents were first reduced to
writing (9th-8th c. BC) is only &quot;striking&quot; under such
an artificial theory of their composition. <BR>
Taking them as authentic documents written in the Mosaic Age (15th
c. BC), such authenticity of local color and detail is perfectly
natural and what one would expect, with divine revelation.  Yet,
despite artificial theories of composition which are still almost
universally foisted upon the patriarchal narratives, their increasing
archaeological vindication is forcing scholars to treat them with
more respect than used to be the case until quite recently.
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B>2. Abraham and Mari</B> 
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The ancient city of Mari on the middle Euphrates is represented
today by Tell Hariri about seven miles north of modern Abou Kemal.
Excavations undertaken there since 1933 by Andre Parrot and others
have brought to light more than twenty thousand tablets from the
archives of the royal palace and uncovered a temple of Ishtar
and a Ziggurat.  In the time of Abram (c. 2100 BC) Mari was one
of the most flourishing and brilliant cities of the Mesopotamian
world, and the patriarch and his father Terah probably passed
through thise petropolis on their way to Haran.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The large number of the tablets discovered present diplomatic
correstpondence teween Zimri-Lim, the last king of Mari, with
his ambassadors and agents and with Hammurappi, the king of Babylon
(c. 1728-1685 BC). 
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Abraham's migration from Ur, according to the Biblical chronology,
however, took place some four hundred years before the period
of the Mari letters and the reign of Zimri-Lim.  At this time
&quot;the region about Haran was probably under the control of
Mari.&quot;  The city of Nahor (Genesis 24:10) is mentioned quite
frequently in the Mari letters. <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the light of the interesting fact that Abram is the first person
in the Bible to bear the name Hebrew (<I>`ibri</I>) (Genesis 14:13),
the occurrence of the term &quot;Habiru&quot; in the Mari letters
(eighteenth century BC) and earlier in the Cappadocian texts (nineteenth
century BC) as well as in the later Nuzi, Hittite, Amarna and
Ugaritic texts (15th-14th centuries BC) is significant, since
the philological equation Hebrew - Habiru seems not unreasonable.
 The wide occurance of the term Habiru shows that the term &quot;is
not an ethnic designation, for the Habiru of these various texts
are of mixed racial origin, including both Semitic and non-Semitic
elements, but its fundamental meaning seems to be 'wanderers',
'those who pass from place to place.'&quot; 
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Placing the Habiru in a much wider context as a result of archeological
discoveries is not an embarrssment to the Biblical representations.
 Eber as an ancestor of the Hebrews (Gen. 11:16f.) included more
than Abraham and his descendants through Isaac and Jacob.  Some
of his posterity were evidently left in Babylonia when Terah migrated
with his family, and some were left in northern Mesopotamia when
Abram migrated from Haran.
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B> 3. Names:</B> 
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The name Abram has been found in Mesopotamia in the second millenium
BC under the forms Abamrama (A-ba-am-ra-ma; A-ba-ra-ma) and Abamram
(A-ba-am-ra-am).  This shows that it was actually a name in use
at an early date.  The name Ya`qub'el &quot;May El protect&quot;
occurs not only as a place name in Palestine in the fifteenth
century BC (Thutmose III's list), but also as Yahgubil (Ya-ah-gu-ub-il)
in tablets of the eighteenth century BC from Chagar Bazar in northern
Mesopotamia.  The name is obviously very similar to the name Jacob
(Ya`aqov). 
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Both Isaac and Jacob are abbreviated thophorous names whose full
form would be Yitshaq-'el and Ya`aqub'el, and belong to types
known in the environment from which the early Hebrews came.  Similarly,
names closely resembling the shortened forms Laban and Joseph
appear in documents of the nineteenth century BC.
