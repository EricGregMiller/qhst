<h1><b>Solomon</b></h1>
<P>
 David had subdued neighboring nations which showed themselves
hostile to the Israelite monarchy, so that Solomon's long rule
of forty years was threatened by no formidable enemies and became
celebrated as an era of almost unbroken peace.  David named his
son Solomon (Hebrew, <I>Shlomo</I>), signifying &quot;peaceable&quot;,
perhaps in anticipation or at least hope for the tranquility of
his son's reign.
<P>
 The wide exten of David's conquests (2 Samuel 8:1-18) and the
greatness of Solomon's empire are emphatically indicated in the
biblical notices (1 Kings 4:21).  Yet in the light of the great
empires of Assyria on the Euphrates, the Hittites on the Halys
and Egypt on the Nile, which had existed during centuries of Old
Testament history, nothing would seem more unlikely than that
such a splendid and sprawling kingdom as Solomon's would have
been built up or maintained.  yet archeological discoveries plainly
show that precisely during this period from about 1100 to 900
BC the power of all of these great nations was providentially
either in eclipse or abeyance, so that Solomon could rule with
the splendor and wisdom divinely promised him (1 Kings 3:13).
<P>
 Against the city state of Hamath on the Orontes River in the
extreme north of his kingdom, a very insigniicant power in comparison
to the great Assyrian, Hittite and Egyptian empires, Solomon went
to war.  He was obliged to do so to secure this portion of his
frontier.  Accordingly, he took Hamath and built store cities
in this region (2 Chron. 8:3, 4).
<P>
 Excavations and discoveries at the ancient location of Hamath,
120 miles north of Damascus, have demonstrated that the city had
a long and interesting occupation, particularly as a Hittite center,
as evidenced by the recovery of a large number of Hittite inscriptions
from this site as early as 1871.  Toi, its king in the time of
David, established ties of friendship with Israel, and congratulated
David on his defeat of Hadadezer of Zobah, a common enemy (2 Samuel
8:9, 10:1).
<P>
 Rezon of Damascus (1 Kings 11:23-25) and Hadad the Edomite (1
Kings 11:14-22) were also enemies of Solomon, but neither was
strong enough to cause serious trouble to the rich and powerful
Israelite monarch.  However, Rezon, in seizing Damascus and making
it a center of Aramaean might, laid the foundations of a strong
power that was to prove a deadly antagnoist to the Northern Kingdom
for a century and a half after Solomon's death and the break-up
of the United Monarchy.
<P>
 To hold Damascus in check, Solomon fortified Hazor, evidently
to control the crossing of the upper Jordan, and built cities
for his horsemen and chariots in the Lebanon region (1 kings 9:15,
19).  He was also compelled to guard the road south past Edom
to Ezion-geber to prevent interruption in the flow of copper and
other wares from his key port on the Red Sea by the unfriendly
Hadad, who had returned from Egypt to plague the Israelite monarch.
 Outside of these difficulites, Solomon's relations with neighboring
kings were amicable.  As a result he was able to devote himself
to the organization of his kingdom and to the cultivation of the
arts of peace, activities which brought an unprecedented era of
prosperity to his realm.
<P>
<B>The Remarkable Prosperity of the Solomonic Era</B>
<P>
 The rapid expansion of Israel's economic life under Solomon was
due to a number of reasons, among which the political was of great
importance.  Either by treaties of friendship or subjugation David
had extended the sphere of Israel's influence so that by the time
Solomon succeeded to the throne the nation possessed a vast potential
for expanding trade and inflow of tribute.  Solomon, displaying
political and administrative wisdom like his father, showed himself
equal to taking full advantage of the unparalleled opportunity
for economic expansion that presented itself to him, and &quot;in
his relations with other peoples...maintained his father's policy.&quot;
<P>
<B>Solomon's Foreign Diplomacy.</B>  Israel's great commercial
king carefully cultivated the ties of friendship which had existed
between Israel and the important maritive kingdom of Tyre and
which had great economic advantages.  In addition he preserved
at least the outward loyalty of subject peoples, except those
of Damascus and Edom in the latter part of his long reign when
decadence in his adminstration had set in. The outward loyalty
of subject peoples as accomplished largely by royal marriages,
which bound his satellites to him, but lead to grave religious
evils (1 Kings 11:1-8).  Foremost among these royal alliances
was that with Egypt, which was cemented by his marriage to the
daughter of the reigning Pharaoh (1 Kings 3:1-2).  This ruler
possessed considerable power, since he was able to claim and partially
enforce authority over Palestine.
<P>
 The important and strategic Canaanite city of Gezer in the Shephelah
near the Maritime Plain, with an occupational history going back
to about 3000 BC, is said to have revolted against Pharaoh, and
after being destroyed, to have been handed over to Solomon as
a dowry with Pharaoh's daughter when she was given in marriage
to the Hebrew king (1 Kings 9:16).  The excavated ruins of the
site confirm the statement of the book of Kings and show that
Solomon did not actually rebuild the city, but errected a fortress
on a neighboring site (1 Kings 9:17).
<P>
<B>Solomon's Domestic Economy. </B> Within his own realm the Israelite
monarch took important administrative steps both to further prosperity
and to siphon a considerable portion of the vastly augmented national
income into the royal treasury to finance his luxurious style
of living and his ambitious building and commercial ventures.
 His division of the country into 12 districts, which to a large
extent ignored the old tribal boundaries (1 Kings 4:7-20), is
specifically mentioned and must have been only the skeleton of
a highly efficient organization, presided over by important officals,
two of whom were married to daughters of Solomon.
<P>
 One of the main sources of the enormous revenue required to support
Solomon's splendid reign was direct taxation in the form of money,
goods, or unpaid labor furnished for his vast building projects.
 Weighed silver was the medium os exchange, if money was employed,
since coins did not come into use until centuries later.   But
archeological evidence points to the fact that money was not common
and that the Israelite paid his taxes in staple produce of the
land, such as wheat, wine and oil.  Even as late as the ninth
century BC, the tribute rendered to Israel by Mesha of Moab, of
archeological fame, whose stele was discovered in 1868, was paid
in lambs and wool, products of a pastoral country (2 Kings 3:4).
<P>
 Besides taxes in money and produce, Solomon required large donations
of free labor from the remnants of the original non-Israelite
inhabitants of the land, whom he pressed into practical slavery
(1 Kings 9:20-21).  He also raised a special levy from &quot;all
Israel&quot; apparently for the construction of the temple (1
Kings 5:13-18).
<P>
<B>Solomon's Commercial Expansion.</B>  Another important source
of revenue for the royal treasurery was from the king's remarkable
expansion of industry.  He is renowned as &quot;the first great
commercial king of Israel.&quot;  Taking full advantage of peculiarly
favorable conditions which existed both by land and by sea, he
expanded trade to a remarkable degree.  The domestication of the
Arabian camel from the twelth century BC onward, as Albright has
noted, brough with it a tremendous increase in nomadic mobility.
 Caravans could now travel through deserts whose sources of water
might be two or three days apart.  There is ample archeological
evidence that by Solomon's time caravan trade between the Fertile
Crescent and south Arabia was already well-developed.
<P>
 Solomon's control of the frontier districts of Zobah, Damascus,
hauran, Ammon, Moab and Edom meant that he monopolized the entire
cravan trade between Arabia and Mesopotamia from the Red Sea to
Palmyra (&quot;Tadmor&quot;, 2 Chron. 8:4), an oasis 140 miles
northeast of Damascus, which he built (1 Kings 9:18).  By thus
exercising control over virtually all the trade routes both to
the east and the west of the Jordan, the Israelite monarch was
able substantially to increase the revenue flowing into the royal
coffers by exacting tolls from the merchants passing through his
territories (1 Kings 10:15).
<P>
<B>Trade in Horses and Chariots.</B>  This prosperous enterprise,
developed by Israel's industrially minded monarch and made possible
because of his control of the trade routes between Asia Minor,
Mesopotamia, and Egypt, is recounted in what had been an enigmatic
passage in 1 Kings 10:28-29:
<P>
 Solomon's horses were imported from Egypt and Kue -- the royal
merchants purchaced them from Kue.  They imported a chariot from
Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for a hundred
and fifty.  They also exported them to all the kings of the Hittites
and of the Arameans.
<P>
 Instead of Kue at this point, the KJV has &quot;linen yarn&quot;,
and the American Revised Version of 1901 had &quot;droves.&quot;
 The NIV, the NASB, and the New Scofield have the right translation:
Kue or Qwh.  Qwh, according to the Assyrian records, is Cilicia,
the country between the Taurus Mountains and the Mediterranean
Sea in Asia Minor.
<P>
 This reading of the text would make Solomon the commercial middleman
between Egypt and Asia Minor, having a complete monopoly on the
horse and chariot trade, four Cilician horses being exchanged
for one Egyptian chariot.
<P>
<B>Construction of Chariot Cities.</B>  Solomon is said to have
built up a powerful standing army of chariotry (1 Kings 4:26),
which was stationed in a number of chariot cities, among which
Jerusalem, Hazor, Megiddo and Gezer are mentioned (1 Kings 9:15-19).
 &quot;Solomon accumulated chariots and horses; he had fourteen
hundred chariots and twelve thousands horses, which he kept in
the chairot cities and also with him in Jerusalem.&quot; (1 Kings
10:26).
<P>
 Archeological excavations at Megiddo, Hazor and Gezer have illustrated
the biblical notices of Solomon's building operations there. 
Especially at Megiddo, the great thirteen acre mound in the Valley
of Esdraelon and the headquarters of Solomon's fifth administrative
district, notable discovereis dating from the Solomonic era have
been made.  A group of stables, capable of housing at least 450
horses and a hundred fifty chariots, have been uncovered.  The
plan and mode of construction of these buildings are definitely
Solomonic.  There has been some doubt expressed recently in the
literature as to whether these are really stables or if they are
actually storerooms of some sort.
<P>
 Similar groups of stables (or whatever they might be) from Solomon's
time at Hazor and Tell el Hesi had other evidence of Solomon's
splendor and military power.  The biblical evideence, substantiated
by archeology, is that Solomon was the first king of Israel to
employ horses and chariots in fighting.  David had &quot;hamstrung
all the chariot horses&quot; (2 Sam. 8:4).  But compare Deut.
17:16.  Notice the difference in attitutde between David and Solomon!
 Cf. 2 Sam. 12:5-6 and Exodus 22:1 for the story of the sheep
and the penalty.
<P>
<B>Voyages to Ophir.</B>  Solomon's navy and his maritime trading
projects in collaboration with Hiram of Tyre constitute another
source of his proverbial prosperity. 
<P>
 King Solomon also built ships at Ezion Geber, which is near Elath
in Edom, on the shore of the Red Sea.  And Hiram sent his men
-- sailors who knew the sea -- to serve in the fleet with Solomon's
men.  They sailed to Ophir and brought back 420 talents of gold,
which the delevered to King Solomon. (1 Kings 9:26-28).
<P>
 The king had a fleet of trading ships at sea along with the ships
of Hiram.  Once every three years it returned carrying gold, silver
and ivory, and apes and baboons. (1 Kings 10:22)
<P>
 It should be noted that the word translated &quot;baboons&quot;
is rare, and it is unclear precisely what is intended.  Some older
translations have &quot;peacocks&quot; instead.
<P>
 The phrase translated &quot;trading ships&quot; (Hebrew <I>'oni
tarshish</I>) in older translations is rendered simple &quot;Ships
of Tarshish&quot;.  The newer rendering is the consequence of
the light brought from early Phoenician trading activities in
the Mediterranean.  Another way of rendering the phrase would
be &quot;smelting&quot; or &quot;refining ships&quot;, since these
were the ships hauling smelted ores from the mining towns in Sardinia
and Spain.  Although such colonizing and commercial activity previous
to the eigth century BC was commonly denied the Phoenicians by
writers on the history and arecheology of the western Mediterranean
world until relatively recently, inscriptions recovered from Nora
and Bosa in Sardinia prove that as early as the ninth century
BC Phoenicians were colonizing and trading in the western Mediterranean.
 One of these inscriptions from Nora contains the name Tarshish
immediately before the name Sardinia, evidently indicating that
the Phoenician name of Nora was Tarshish, meaning &quot;the Refinery.&quot;
<P>
 The name &quot;Tarshish&quot; also occurs in an inscription of
Esarhaddon, king of Assyria in the seventh century BC and refers
to a Phoenician land at the opposite end of the Mediterranean
from the island of Cyprus.  In the light of the archeological
evidence available there is not the least reason to doubt that
at the time of Hiram I of Tyre (c. 969-936 BC) Phoenician commerce
was already widespread in the Mediterranean, and that Tyrian seamen
were able to assist Solomon in building his fleet and in furnishing
the skill to operate it.
<P>
<B>Copper Mining and Refining.</B>  Archeology not only attests
the historical reasonableness of the fact that Phoenician seamen
and artisans aided Solomon in building and operating his fleet
in the Red Sea, but cllearly illustrates an additional point.
 Phoenician technicians built the seaport of Ezeion-geber for
him.  An important copper smeltery discovered there by Nelson
Glueck (1938-1940), the first ever found, was certainly the work
of Phoenician craftsmen who were widely experinenced in the art
of setting up copper furnaces and refineries at the smelting settlements
in Sardinia and in Spain (the later Tartessus) which were called
Tarshish, after which the ships specially equipped for transporting
such ore and metal cargoes were called Tarshish ships. 
<P>
 The construction of the copper refinery at ancient Ezion-geber
(modern Tell el-Kheleifeh) is unusually good, as Glueck has noted,
and points to practical knowledge and skill which were the result
of long experience.  The inescapable conclusion is that Hiram's
technicians, who were experts in the business, were responsible
for the construction of the refinery and that it dated from the
tenth century BC and was rebuilt at various later periods.  Tell
el-Kheleifeh was, therefore, a Tarshish, or metal refinery like
the Phoenician stations of the same name in Sardinia and Spain.
<P>
 The discovery of the copper refinery at Tell el-Kheleifeh illustrates
the brief but important biblical reference to copper smelting
and casting in the Jordan Valley (1 Kings 7:46) and points to
another prolific sources of Solomon's wealth.  As Glueck says,
it was Solomon &quot;who was the first one who placed the mining
industry in the Wadi Arabah upon a really national scale.&quot;
 As a result, copper became the king's principlal export and his
merchants' main stock in trade.  Putting out from Ezion-geber
laden with smelted ore, his fleet brought back in exchange otehr
valuable goods obtainable in Arabian ports or from the nearby
coasts of Africa.
<P>
<B>The Visit From the Queen of Sheba. </B> Solomon's ships plied
the Red Sea.  His caravans penetrated far into Arabia.  In his
wide commercial outreach he must have been doing business with,
and at the same time necessarily competing with, the famous Queen
of Sheba.  Her strenuous journey (1 Kings 10) to Jerusalem by
camel, traversing over twelve hundred miles of inhospitable terrain,
almost certainly was dictated by business reasons as well as by
the pleasure of seeing Solomon's splendor and hearing his wisdom.
<P>
 The visit must have involved delimitation of spheres of interest
and the arrangement of trade treaties which regulated the equitable
exchange of the products of Arabia for the products of Palestine
and particularly the copper of the Wadi Arabah.  The Queen's diplomatic
visit and conversations with the Israelite monarch were evidently
highly successful (1 Kings 10:1, 2, 10, 13).
<P>
 Although the Queen of Sheba of the Solomonic era has not been
attested as yet in South-Arabian inscriptions, there is no valid
reason for denying the historicity of either her or her visit
to the Israelite monarch.  It is true that the oldest inscriptions
of Saba (Sheba) reach back only to the seventh or eighth century
BC and Assyrian inscriptions do not begin to mention names of
Sabean kings until toward the end of the eighth century BC.  However,
there is no warrant to doubt that Sheba was an important kingdom
or tribal confedderacy two or three centuries earlier.  Nor is
there any reason to dismiss the whole account of the Queen's visit
&quot;as a romantic tale,&quot; as generally used to be done.
 Although queens played little part in the later history of South
Arabia, they ruled large tribal confederacies in North Arabia
from the ninth to the seventh centuries BC, as the cuneiform inscriptions
relate.
<P>
<B>Solomon's Matrimonial Alliances.</B>  To insure the future
peace and security of his realm, Solomon yielded to the custom
of the times and made many domestic alliances with subject races
and tribes by marrying foreign women.  From the Amarna Letters
of the 14th century BC and numerous other sources, there is ample
illustration of this practice of royal intermarriage for political
and other reasons.  Kings of Egypt, for example, gave their daughters
in marriage to the kings of the Hittites and the princes of Mitanni
in the 14th and 13th centuries BC.  Ahab of the royal house of
Omri married into the royal house of Tyre in the 9th century BC.
<P>
 Instead of securing the kingdom, this evil expedient led to spiritual
decline and idolatry, and the eventual disruption of the nation.
 It was a disaster both nationally and personally.  Of the many
deities to which his foreign wives turned his heart, perhaps the
best known in the ancient world was Ashtoreth, called &quot;the
Abomination of the Sidonians&quot; in 1 Kings 11:5, 33.  She was
a fertility goddess, known as Astarte among the Greeks, and Ishtar
in Babylon.  Worshipping this goddess usually meant having sex
with prostitutes in her temple.  In addition to being a fertility
deity, she was also a goddess of war in Babylon and Assyria. 
Her picture appears on a seal impression found at Bethel, where
her name is given in hieroglyphic characters.
<P>
<B>Solomon's Temple</B>
<P>
 Archeology has furnished testimony that Solomon's building and
industrial activities were even more extensive than might be concluded
from the vivid account in the Book of Kings.  There is, however,
evidence to substantiate the biblical notices that Israel's king
drew heavily upon Phoenician skill not only in his maritime ventures,
but particularly in the construction of the magnificent temple
at Jerusalem and other buildings.  Excavations by Albright at
Gibeah (Tell el-Ful), the site of Saul's capital, have revealed
the strength but extreme crudity of the royal buildings in comparison
to the architectural skill displayed at Solomonic Megiddo and
required by the temple and royal palace at Jerusalem.
<P>
 At the time of David and Solomon, both of whom maintained ties
of amity with hiram I of Tyre (c. 969-936 BC), southern Phoenicia
was consolidated under one king who ruled at Tyre, but who bore
the official title of &quot;King of the Sidonians&quot;.  From
the twelfth to the seventh centuries BC, Tyre and Sidon existed
as one political entity.  Only before and after this period were
there two separate states, so that Hiram was a rich and powerful
ruler, in winning and maintaining whose friendship Solomon gave
a demonstration of his proverbial wisdom.  Moreover, the name
Hiram (or Ahiram) was a common Phoenician royal name, as is attested
by the inscriptions, notably that found on the sarcophagus of
Ahiram at Byblus (Biblical Gebel: Psalm 83:7; Ezekiel 27:9), discovered
in 1923-24 by a French expedition under M. Montet and dating probably
from the 11th century BC.
<P>
<B>The Plan of the Temple.</B>  The numerous archeological finds
in the ANE have cast a lot of light on the construction of the
temple in Jerusalem, although that temple itself has been utterly
destroyed.  It is now known that the plan of the edifice was characteristically
Phoenician, as would be expected since it was builty by an architect
from Tyre (1 Kings 7:13-15).  Similar ground plans of sactuaries
of the general period (1200 to 900 BC) have been excavated in
northern Syria, especially by the University of Chicago at Tell
Tainat in 1936, and the findings have demonstrated that the specifications
of the Solomonic structure outlined in 1 Kings 6-7 are pre-Greek
and authentic for the tenth century BC and not to be denied historical
genuiness or assigned to the period of the Hellenic influence
after the sixth century BC, as some critics were accustomed to
do.
<P>
 Like Solomon's temple the shrine at Tell Tainat was rectangular,
with three rooms, a portico with two columns in front, a main
hall, and a cella or shrine with a raised platform.  It was two-thirds
as long as Solomon's temple and was in all likelihood lined with
cedar.
<P>
 The proto-Aeolic pilaster capital was extensively used in Solomon's
temple, and examples of this construction have been discovered
at Megiddo, Samaria, at Shechem, in Moab and near Jerusalem, dating
from before 1000 BC, or as at Megiddo, from the eighth century
BC.  The decorations of the temple, such as lillies, palmettes,
and cherubim, were likewise characteristically Syro-Phoenician,
the latter being a winged lion with human head -- that is, a winged
sphinx.  This hybrid animal, however, was not a Solomonic innovation,
but was inherited from the tabernacle and appears hundreds of
times in the iconography of western Asia between 1800 and 600
BC.  Many representations are found with a deity or king seated
on a throne supported by two cherubim.  In Israel, Yahweh and
his throne -- both invisible -- were smilarly supported by symbolic
cherubim (but cf. Ezekiel 1:4-14 and 10:15).
<P>
<B>Jachin and Boaz.</B>  Like the north Syrian shrine at Tell
Tainat Solomon's ediface had two columns which stood in the portico.
 Such pillars flanking the main entrance of a temple were common
in the first millenium BC in Syria, Phoenicia, and Cyprus.  The
spread eastward to Assyria where they are to be found in Sargon's
temples at Khorsabad (late third century BC) and westward to the
Phoenician colonies in the western Mediterranean.  In Solomon's
temple, following a common Near Eastern custom, they bore the
distinctive names &quot;Jachin&quot; and &quot;Boaz&quot;.  It
has been convincingly demonstrated that the names of the two columns
represented the first words of dynastic oracles hich were inscribed
on them.  The &quot;Jachin&quot; formula may have been something
like &quot;Yahweh will establish (Hebrew <I>yakin</I>) your throne
forever&quot; and the &quot;Boaz&quot; oracle may have run something
like &quot;In Yahweh is the king's strength&quot; (Hebrew <I>boaz</I>).
<P>
 Jachin and Boaz have been frequently interpreted as sacred obelisks,
like those which stood beside the great Egyptia temples at Heliopolis
and Thebes, or beside the temple of Melcarth at Tyre, and it is
possible, of course, that Solomon might make concessions to the
architectural fads of his day.  Sometimes they have been viewed
as stylized trees or again as cosmic pillars, like the pillars
of Hercules.  Robertson Smith suggested, years ago, that they
might be gigantic cressets or fire altars.
<P>
 W.F. Albright adopted Robertson Smith's essential view that Jachin
and Boaz were huge cressets or fire altars, using proof from the
painted tombs of Marisa in southern Palestine, where similar incense
burners appear.  Corroborating evidence is also drawn from the
Egyptian Djed Pillar, a sacred emblem of Osiris, which bears certain
similarities to these collumns.  Most important, Albright stressed
that each of the shafts of the two pillars is clearly said to
be crowned with a <I>gullah</I> -- that is, an oil basin of a
lampstand (1 Kings 7:41; cf. Zechariah 4:3).
<P>
 Thus, following Phoenician models, these incense stands apparently
illuminated the facade of the temple in Jerusalem.
<P>
<B>The Furnishings of the Temple.</B>  Archeology has also shed
light on the equipment of the temple, which in part, at least,
was modelled after Syro-Phoenician copies, and which in turn went
back to much earlier items from Mesopotamia.  The altar of burnt
offering, for instance, from the measurements of that in Ezekiel's
temple (Ezekiel 43:13-17), which was certainly the same shape
as Solomon's altar, if not the same size, was a miniature temple-tower
(Akkadian, <I>zigguratu</I>), after which it was partly designed.
 Ezekiel's description of this altar is important and exceedingly
interesting from an archeological point of view because it preserves
some of the current terminology which used to be applied to its
various parts.
<P>
 According to Ezekiel's account the foundation was called, symbolically,
&quot;the bosom of the earth&quot; (<I>heq ha-aretz</I>, Ezek.
43:14) and the top &quot;the mountain of God&quot; (<I>har 'el</I>,
Ezekiel 43:15-16).  Both of these expressions are literal translations
of the corresponding Akkadian terms for the base and summit of
the common staged temple-tower or ziggurat of the ancient Babylonian
world, as is known from cuneiform tablets.  In this connection,
a further striking parallel appears in the fact that the summit
of the <I>ziqquratu</I> (lit., &quot;mountain peak&quot;), like
the Hebrew altar of burnt offering (Exodus 27:2; Ezekiel 43:15),
was also ornamented with four horns, as is known from inscriptions
and monumental representations.
<P>
 It is interesting to notice in addition that the word for &quot;temple&quot;
in Hebrew (<I>hekal</I>) had been taken over by the Canaanites
from the non-Semitic Sumerians, the precursors of the semitic
Babylonians in the lower Tigris-Euphrates Valley, at least a millenium
and a half earlier.  Such borrowings are common as in the case
of the cherubim and other features both of the tabernacle and
temple, and do not in the least imply that the Hebrews attached
any pagan significance whatever to them.  In fact, as in the tabernacles
where every item of construction and equipment was divinely ordered,
each detail was at the same time divinely invested with a meaning
consonant with the worship of the one true God and endowed with
a rich symbolism typical of the coming future Messianic Redeemer.
<P>
 However, Solomon went far beyond the chaste divinely ordered
simplicity of the tabernacle and its symbolic ritual and furniture.
 An instance of this is not only furnished by the twin obelisks
gracing the threshold of the temple, but also by the great copper
sea set on twelve bulls, and oriented toward the four quarters
of the compass, a new feature in the sanctuary court (1 Kings
7:23-26).  This immense basin, taking the place of the laver of
the tabernacle, was ornately decorated with bunches of flowers
in high relief and served, as did its simple precursor, for ceremonial
washings.  In the name given to it by Solomon (sea) and in its
construction, both doubtless the result of Syro-Phoenician influence,
clear cosmic significance is apparent.
<P>
 In the ANE, the &quot;sea&quot; was universally recognized as
possessing cosmic significance, and in name and function Solomon's
&quot;molten sea&quot; can scarcely be separated from the Mesopotamian
&quot;sea&quot; <I>Apsu</I>, a term used both as the designation
of the suberranean fresh water ocean, the source of all life and
fertility, and as the name of a basin of holy water set up in
the temple.  Moreover, these various cosmic sources of water were
conceived in mythological terms as dragons both in Akkadian (<I>Apsu</I>
and <I>Tiamat</I>), Canaanite (&quot;sea&quot;, <I>yammu</I> and
&quot;river&quot; <I>nahar</I>) and in Biblical Hebrew (&quot;sea&quot;
<I>yam</I>, and &quot;rivers&quot; <I>neharoth</I>).  The term
&quot;sea&quot;, meaning the source of life among the Syrians
and Phoenicians, came to denote the Mediterranean, the main source
of Canaanite livelihood, as in Mesopotamia, it had denoted the
putative subterranean source of the great life-giving rivers of
that land.
<P>
 The relation of the &quot;sea&quot; to the portable lavers that
Solomon made (1 Kings 7:38), which correspond to Phoenician portable
lavers found on the island of Cyprus, was similar to that between
the &quot;sea&quot; (<I>Apsu</I>) and &quot;the portable basins
of water&quot; (<I>egubbe</I>) in Babylonian temples.
<P>
 Some would suggest that inn going beyond the divinely ordered
simplicity of the tabernacle, the temple with its elaborate organization
and its heavy indebtedness to Syro-Phoenician religious architecture
and practice presented the peril of religious syncretism, which
was to manifest itself in intermittant conflict between religious
assimilators and separatists in subequent centuries.  
<P>
 On the other hand, considering the lack of criticism in the biblical
account of the building of the temple, the fact that building
a temple in place of the tabernacle was God's intent, and the
obvious blessing of Yahweh upon the finished product then and
later, it is perhaps better to recognize simply a translation
of ancient forms into an approach more comprehensible to the times
of Solomon, just as changes in a language require the updating
of ancient texts or new translations.  After all, somewhere between
two and four hundred years had passed since the tabernacle's design
had been established; culture and history had marched on; changes
were necessary and not inappropriate.  After all, we do not today
use the same songs in church that our forbears of even two hundred
years ago used; we have added sound systems and adopted different
instruments, even.  We don't talk the same way, either.  A constant
reinvention, to keep the old truths from becoming cliches, is
necessary and not despicable, simply because conventions change.
 How we worship God is not as important as <I>that</I> we worship
God, and the how inevitably changes.
<P>
 After all, we no longer worship God in a temple at all; regardless
of the theological reasons, practically speaking, since there
is neither temple nor tabernacle, and since appropriate priests
cannot be identified, there is no way to still worship God by
sacrificing animals.
<P>
 It should also be noticed that there is another shift in the
shape of the temple, when one considers the description Ezekiel
gives of the temple that is apparently yet to be.  It looks neither
like Solomon's temple, nor the temple that followed after the
Exile, nor the renovated temple ornamented by Herod the Great.
