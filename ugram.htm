<h4> Syllabus</h4></center>

<P>
1. This course is designed to give the student a basic understanding of the Ugaritic Language.<P>

<P>
2. In order to accomplish this goal the student will be required to read the assignments in the course and to do the required exercises. <P>

<P>
3. The Textbooks for this course are Stanislav Segert’s “A Basic Grammar of the Ugaritic Language” and “The Cuneiform Alphabetic Texts” by M. Dietrich.<P>

<P>
4. At the conclusion of the course the student will be given a passage to translate.  This translation will compose 50% of the students grade for the course; the other 50% coming from the assignments.  One technical note- Because most students will not have a Ugaritic font on their computer, the texts will be transliterated for the exercises.  The only time the actual cuneiform characters will be used is in the first lesson when the alphabet is learned.<P>
