<center><h1><B>When God is One of Us</B> </h1>
<P>
<B>by Rick Curtis</B> </center>
<P>
In preparation for this work I was confronted with so many differing
opinions and ideas that truly sought to explain what a theophany
was that this work soon became a blessing as God opened up new
understanding to me about who he is and how he works. This work
will both seek to explain what a theophany is in understandable
terms and back my conclusions with a substantial amount of hard
evidence. Issues will be weighed enabling an earnest student of
God's word to formulate their own opinion. To claim some definitive
answer as to what theophanies are would be both proud and illogical,
for that reason this paper will be more of an intense investigation
of the evidence. The reader should not however think that my opinions
will not be present within the body of this work, for they will.
The best place to start, perhaps, is with an attempt to define
what a theophany is.
<P>
<B>DEFINITION</B> 
<P>
A traditional evangelical definition will suffice for now. As
the reader will see, it is my opinion that this definition, although
close, falls short of being concise. Once we define what a theophany
is in semi-clear terms, we can then investigate and eventually
come to the definition which I feel best summarizes all the evidence
at the conclusion of this work. I feel this is a necessary course
of action so the reader will see the subtle but important differences
in my definition. The traditional, evangelical definition is best
made by <I>Nelson's Bible Dictionary</I> which states, <I>&quot;any
direct, visual manifestation of the presence of God.&quot;</I>
Below, please note the list of other definitions, grouped by category,
and a summary of each category. Traditional evangelical definitions
are the definitions we will build upon for this paper. The other
definitions are listed for the reader's investigation, review,
and ultimate acceptance or dismissal.
<P>
<B>TRADITIONAL:</B> 
<P>
<I>A manifestation of God in some empirical form.</I> 
<P>
Charles Augustus Briggs in his work, Inspiration, Authority &amp;
Criticism in the Thought of Charles Augustus Briggs writes<I>,
&quot;The means which God employed to disclose Himself to man
was theophany. It was theophany which distinguished Biblical History
from all other history. And it was theophany which was the guarantee
that the contents of scripture were genuine revelation rather
than human religious speculation. God took the initiative and
personally revealed Himself to man. In these encounters God assumed
various forms: fire, cloud, angel, man and occasionally a disembodied
voice. The form by which God disclosed Himself was not important.
The fact at issue was that the one to whom God revealed Himself
recognized Him as physically present. God did not intend for these
forms to be mistaken for an &quot;inerrant representation of the
invisible God.&quot; </I>
<P>
<B>TRADITIONAL (adding auditory):</B> 
<P>
<I>A theological term used to refer to either a visible or auditory
manifestation of God.</I> 
<P>
The only difference in this definition is the addition of the
word &quot;auditory&quot;. The auditory qualifier is a minority
view and thus will not be expanded on below as we investigate
each area of manifestation.
<P>
<B>NON - CHRISTIAN and LIBERAL:</B> 
<P>
<I>A theophany is a moment of unexpected insight</I>.
<P>
This definition would seek to define every incredible revelation
of man as a theophany. God has created us with unique abilities
of thought and reason. To relegate any new thought or inspiration
to do something great as a theophany, I feel, mistakes who God
created us to be. to shed more light on this definition we could
quote, as above, David E. Bumbaugh: <I>&quot;Musicians -- at least
from the time of Mozart -- have sometimes reported that compositions
appeared unexpectedly in their minds, demanding that they be put
down on paper. It is as if a power not one's self suddenly takes
over the mental process, puts reality together in a new way which
transforms understanding and demands expression.&quot;</I> 
<P>
<B>EASTERN (panentheistic):</B> 
<P>
<I>A theophany is [a] manifestation or appearance of a deity or
of the gods to man.</I> 
<P>
Johannes Scotus Erigena, a 9th Century Christian philosopher stated
<I>&quot;. . . every visible and invisible creature can be called
a theophany, that is, a divine apparition.&quot; </I>The major
problem with this definition is that if one accepts it, they must
then believe that every rock, tree, animal, person, demon, insect,
etc. is a manifestation of God. Interestingly enough, Johannes
Scotus Erigena is considered a <I>Christian</I> philosopher. This
process of thought leads to many other errors, namely a traditional
hiduistic view. If all is a piece of God, how can we then eat
an animal, chop down a tree, step on a spider. This IS quite a
dilemma which inevitably leads to ultimate pacifism. Many religions
are pacifist to their detriment. The eighteenth century Quakers,
having founded Pennsylvania, gave over all control of it rather
than opt/vote for war. Today, Quakers are still extreme pacifists.
I am in no way insinuating that Quakers hold to this view of theophany,
only making a point about pacifism. An eventual outgrowth of a
belief in this definition of theophany.
<P>
<B>PSYCHEDELIC:</B> 
<P>
<I>A manifestation of God due to psychedelic drugs.</I> 
<P>
Huston Smith, Ph.D. in his paper Psychedelic Theophanies and the
Religious Life states, <I>&quot;The psychedelic experience can
be religious. Subjects often say it is, and their reports can
read like accounts of classic theophanies.&quot;</I> [9/b] Obviously,
we will not investigate this definition within this work. It is
here simply for a complete overview of theophanies. Yet, many
religions use psychedelic drugs as their main avenue to contact
the &quot;spirit world&quot; in much the same way others use mind
altering meditation. These practices are inherently non-Christian,
therefore, will not be considered in the body of this work.
<P>
<B>THE QUALIFIER:</B> 
<P>
Although it could be argued that theophanies consist of human,
angelic, non-human and auditory interaction between God and man,
most scholars gravitate toward a visual qualifier. The etymology
itself (theophany) means &quot;an appearance of God&quot;. There
are scholars who would seek to include audible, verbal communication
with God under the definition of theophany, for this work we shall
not.
<P>
<B>HUMAN (ANTHROPOMORPHIC):</B> 
<P>
<blockquote><B>Explanation of Three Types</B></blockquote>
<P>
In several instances, the appearance of God was in corporeal form.
A tangible, audible form which interacted with man. One could
make the case for the incarnation of Christ as being &quot;the
ultimate theophany&quot;, and this will be discussed further on.
God's choice to reveal himself in corporeal form tended to be
for reasons of fellowship or blessing, whether it was God's imparting
of a blessing as in Gen. 32: 24-30 <I>(below)</I>, or for fellowship,
these are by far the most spectacular of Theophanies.<HR>

<P>
<blockquote><I>24 So Jacob was left alone, and a man wrestled with him till
daybreak. 25 When the man saw that he could not overpower him,
he touched the socket of Jacob's hip so that his hip was wrenched
as he wrestled with the man. 26 Then the man said, &quot;Let me
go, for it is daybreak.&quot; But Jacob replied, &quot;I will
not let you go unless you bless me.&quot; 27 The man asked him,
&quot;What is your name?&quot; &quot;Jacob,&quot; he answered.
28 Then the man said, &quot;Your name will no longer be Jacob,
but Israel, because you have struggled with God and with men and
have overcome.&quot; 29 Jacob said, &quot;Please tell me your
name.&quot; But he replied, &quot;Why do you ask my name?&quot;
Then he blessed him there. 30 So Jacob called the place Peniel,
saying, &quot;It is because I saw God face to face, and yet my
life was spared.&quot;(NIV)</I></blockquote><HR>

<P>
By fellowship, I refer to the passages of scripture where we see
God interacting with his creation in intimate, specific ways.
These appearances model a friendship between God and his creation
and resoundingly announce the abounding love our creator has for
us individually.
<P>
The Bible tells us that Enoch walked with God (Gen 5:24);
<P>
<blockquote><I>24 Enoch walked with God; then he was no more, because God
took him away. (NIV)</I> </blockquote>
<P>
Noah also had similar fellowship with God (Gen 6:9);
<P>
<blockquote><I>9 This is the account of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, blameless
among the people of his time, and he walked with God. (NIV)</I></blockquote>

<P>
God can be seen using corporeal form for the announcing of his
promise to Sarah (Gen 18:10)
<P>
<blockquote><I>10 Then the LORD said, &quot;I will surely return to you about
this time next year, and Sarah your wife will have a son.&quot;
Now Sarah was listening at the entrance to the tent, which was
behind him. (NIV)</I> </blockquote>
<P>
Interestingly, we really don't see the appearance of God in corporeal
form for anything other than what would be considered blessing.
To our benefit perhaps, I know that I would prefer the audible
chastisement of the Lord as opposed to the visual. It has been
suggested that a possible exception to this is the account of
the expulsion from the Garden of Eden. Although from the text
it appears that it was audible for the text makes no reference
of God appearing and the passage repeatedly says they (Adam and
Eve) heard... (Gen 3:8-24).
<P>
<B>ANGELIC:</B> 
<P>
The most frequent theophanies were angelic appearances of God.
By angelic, I mean God's word refers to the appearance as &quot;the
angel of the Lord&quot;. Clearly this reference to &quot;the angel
of the Lord&quot; refers to the Lord himself. The examples sighted
below will make that abundantly clear. For example, consider Exodus
23:20-23;
<P>
<blockquote><I>20 &quot;See, I am sending an angel ahead of you to guard you
along the way and to bring you to the place I have prepared. 21
Pay attention to him and listen to what he says. Do not rebel
against him; he will not forgive your rebellion, since my Name
is in him. 22 If you listen carefully to what he says and do all
that I say, I will be an enemy to your enemies and will oppose
those who oppose you. 23 My angel will go ahead of you and bring
you into the land of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Canaanites,
Hivites and Jebusites, and I will wipe them out. (NIV)</I> </blockquote>
<P>
The apparent difficulty with this passage is the third person
reference to &quot;the angel of the Lord&quot; by God himself.
This difficulty dissolves when understood in the greater scope
of scriptural passages. A recurring theme that we see is that
the angelic presence appears, speaks of God's will. The hearer
answers, God changes his speech from third person to a personal
&quot;I the LORD...&quot; Please see the example below (Jud 6:11-16)
being careful to notice the transition taking place;
<P>
<blockquote><I>11 The angel of the LORD came and sat down under the oak in
Ophrah that belonged to Joash the Abiezrite, where his son Gideon
was threshing wheat in a winepress to keep it from the Midianites.
12 When the angel of the LORD appeared to Gideon, he said, &quot;The
LORD is with you, mighty warrior.&quot; 13 &quot;But sir,&quot;
Gideon replied, &quot;if the LORD is with us, why has all this
happened to us? Where are all his wonders that our fathers told
us about when they said, 'Did not the LORD bring us up out of
Egypt?' But now the LORD has abandoned us and put us into the
hand of Midian.&quot; 14 The LORD turned to him and said, &quot;Go
in the strength you have and save Israel out of Midian's hand.
Am I not sending you?&quot; 15 &quot;But Lord,&quot; Gideon asked,
&quot;how can I save Israel? My clan is the weakest in Manasseh,
and I am the least in my family.&quot; 16 The LORD answered, &quot;I
will be with you, and you will strike down all the Midianites
together.&quot; (NIV)</I> </blockquote>
<P>
<B>NON HUMAN: </B>
<P>
Extremely common in the text of scripture is the non-human theophany.
These are the theophanies we thrilled to as children. We wondered
within ourselves how the God which we were coming to understand
could dwell within a burning bush. How God could float above the
people of Israel in a cloud by day and a pillar of flame by night.
Consider Exodus 3:1-6;
<P>
<blockquote><I>1 Now Moses was tending the flock of Jethro his father-in-law,
the priest of Midian, and he led the flock to the far side of
the desert and came to Horeb, the mountain of God. 2 There the
angel of the LORD appeared to him in flames of fire from within
a bush. Moses saw that though the bush was on fire it did not
burn up. 3 So Moses thought, &quot;I will go over and see this
strange sight-- why the bush does not burn up.&quot; 4 When the
LORD saw that he had gone over to look, God called to him from
within the bush, &quot;Moses! Moses!&quot; And Moses said, &quot;Here
I am.&quot; 5 &quot;Do not come any closer,&quot; God said. &quot;Take
off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy
ground.&quot; 6 Then he said, &quot;I am the God of your father,
the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.&quot;
At this, Moses hid his face, because he was afraid to look at
God. (NIV)</I> </blockquote>
<P>
<B>PATTERN FOR TIMES APPEARANCES WERE MADE</B> 
<P>
There is a definable pattern to when we see theophanies taking
place: The establishment of a covenant, the calling of a prophet,
and every major advance in revelation. The purpose / resulting
effect of the theophany was to impress the recipients and to authenticate
the revelation that was given. Charles Augustus Briggs, in his
work Messianic Prophesy states:
<P>
<blockquote><I>&quot;Theophanies initiated Biblical prophecy and were present
at every advance in revelation. The theophanies of God in the
Old Testament formed a great series of divine disclosures culminating
in the Incarnation. They were the &quot;divine seals to the roll
of Hebrew prophecy, sealing every page with an objective divine
verification and authentication.&quot;</I> </blockquote>
<P>
<B>LITERARY FORM OF A THEOPHANY</B> 
<P>
J.K. Kuntz, in his book <I>The Self Revelation of God</I>, makes
a case for an interesting study of the literary form of a Theophany.
He sights the passage in Genesis 26: 23-25 as a very typical example.
Although this pattern is very common, we should not lock a theophany
into this sequence of events. Theophanies sometimes occur without
given items from Kuntz's list.
<P>
<blockquote><I>23 From there he went up to Beersheba. 24 That night the LORD
appeared to him and said, &quot;I am the God of your father Abraham.
Do not be afraid, for I am with you; I will bless you and will
increase the number of your descendants for the sake of my servant
Abraham.&quot; 25 Isaac built an altar there and called on the
name of the LORD. There he pitched his tent, and there his servants
dug a well. (NIV)</I> </blockquote>
<P>
Kuntz calls attention to the following form;
<UL>
<LI>Introduction <I>(Yahweh appeared)</I> 
<LI>Divine Self Assertion<I> (I AM the God of...)</I> 
<LI>Quelling of Human Fear <I>(fear not...)</I>

<LI><I>hieros logos</I> or Holy Word <I>(I will bless you...)</I>

<P>
<B>HISTORICAL CHURCH BELIEFS AS TO WHOm</B> 
<P>
The very early church really hadn't reasoned out this problem,
and quite honestly probably hadn't even considered it. It wasn't
until the time of Saint Justin that it was pondered. Justin lived
from somewhere around 100AD to 165AD. From his time on it has
been generally accepted that theophanies are the preincarnate
logos, Jesus Christ. There are a select few who would argue for
the Father so we will briefly touch on this idea in the next section.
<P>
<B>THE CASE FOR THE FATHER:</B> 
<P>
The case for the Father: Although the abundance of the evidence
points toward theophanies being the preincarnate logos, there
are those who insist it is the Father. The major problem with
this view is that it is a defensive one. The position needs chip
away at each piece of evidence that clearly points to Christ.
The position in and of itself has no definitive &quot;offensive&quot;
passages. This position would claim that in cases where the scripture
states &quot;no man can see God and live&quot; (paraphrase mine),
that the trinity is being referred to. Thus no man can look upon
the shekinah glory of God (trinity) and live, but one should be
able to survive the encounter with just the Father. This position
has little scriptural support, unlike the case for Christ. Also
the scripture says:
<P>
<blockquote><I>1 John 6:46 Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he
which is of God, he hath seen the Father. [KJV]</I> </blockquote>
<P>
<B>THE CASE FOR THE SON:</B> 
<P>
The case for Christ: It seems very likely that the theophanies
which we see in the Old Testament are Jesus Christ, the second
person of the trinity, the preincarnate logos. While true, this
argument is based on purely a logical progression of ideas, it
is no less valid.
<P>
<B>The Bible is very clear in that no man has seen God:</B> 
<UL>
<LI><blockquote><I>Who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which
no man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see:
to whom be honour and power everlasting. Amen. (1 Tim 6:16) </I></blockquote>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><I><blockquote>No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another,
God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us. (1 John 4:12)</I></blockquote>

</UL>

<UL>
<LI><blockquote><I>Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he which is
of God, he hath seen the Father. (1 John 6:46)</I> </blockquote>
</UL>

<P>
<B>Also, if we should see Him we would perish:</B> 
<P>
<blockquote><I>And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no
man see me, and live. (Exo 33:20)</I> </blockquote>
<P>
<B>That God is spirit:</B> 
<P>
<blockquote><I>God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him
in spirit and in truth. (John 4:24)</I> </blockquote>
<P>
<B>Yet, we are told of men seeing God and living:</B> 
<P>
<blockquote><I>24 So Jacob was left alone, and a man wrestled with him till
daybreak. 25 When the man saw that he could not overpower him,
he touched the socket of Jacob's hip so that his hip was wrenched
as he wrestled with the man. 26 Then the man said, &quot;Let me
go, for it is daybreak.&quot; But Jacob replied, &quot;I will
not let you go unless you bless me.&quot; 27 The man asked him,
&quot;What is your name?&quot; &quot;Jacob,&quot; he answered.
28 Then the man said, &quot;Your name will no longer be Jacob,
but Israel, because you have struggled with God and with men and
have overcome.&quot; 29 Jacob said, &quot;Please tell me your
name.&quot; But he replied, &quot;Why do you ask my name?&quot;
Then he blessed him there. 30 So Jacob called the place Peniel,
saying, <B>&quot;It is because I saw God face to face, and yet
my life was spared.&quot; </B>(NIV) (Bold Mine)</I> </blockquote>
<P>
This leaves us a logical problem unless we speculate that the
preincarnate Christ is the one making the appearances to man.
It is He who wrestled with Jacob, He that was the fire of the
burning bush, He who went before the armies of Israel. After all,
we are told in the New Testament t<B>hat Christ revealed the Father:</B>

<P>
<blockquote><I>No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which
is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him. (John 1:18)</blockquote>
</I>
<P>
<B>Christ himself said:</B> 
<P>
<blockquote><I>I and my Father are one. (John 10:30)</I> </blockquote>
<P>
<blockquote><I>Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and
yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath
seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Show us the Father?
10 Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father
in me? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself:
but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works. 11 Believe
me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe
me for the very works' sake. 12 Verily, verily, I say unto you,
He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also;
and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my
Father. 13 And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I
do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. 14 If ye shall
ask any thing in my name, I will do it. (John 14:9-14)</I> </blockquote>
<P>
How else can this by understood than as Christ. Another interesting
fact in support of this position is that once we saw Christ, who
revealed the Father, and he was lifted up, theophanies ceased.
The ultimate revelation of who God is was made so no further theophany
was needed. Also, consider the following passages:
<P>
<blockquote><I>Gen 16:13 And she called the name of the LORD that spake unto
her, Thou God seest me: for she said, Have I also here looked
after him that seeth me? 14 Wherefore the well was called Beerlahairoi;
behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered. 15 And Hagar bare Abram
a son: and Abram called his son's name, which Hagar bare, Ishmael.
16 And Abram was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bare
Ishmael to Abram. 17:1 And when Abram was ninety years old and
nine, the<B> LORD appeared to Abram</B>, and said unto him, <B>I
am the Almighty God</B>; walk before me, and be thou perfect.
2 And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply
thee exceedingly. 3 And Abram fell on his face:<B> and God talked
with him</B>, saying, [KJV] [Bold Mine]</I> 
<P>
<I>Judges 6: 11 <B>The angel of the LORD came</B> and sat down
under the oak in Ophrah that belonged to Joash the Abiezrite,
where his son Gideon was threshing wheat in a winepress to keep
it from the Midianites. 12 When <B>the angel of the LORD appeared
to Gideon</B>, he said, &quot;The LORD is with you, mighty warrior.&quot;
13 &quot;But sir,&quot; Gideon replied, &quot;if the LORD is with
us, why has all this happened to us? Where are all his wonders
that our fathers told us about when they said, 'Did not the LORD
bring us up out of Egypt?' But now the LORD has abandoned us and
put us into the hand of Midian.&quot; 14 The LORD turned to him
and said, &quot;Go in the strength you have and save Israel out
of Midian's hand. Am I not sending you?&quot; 15 &quot;But Lord,&quot;
Gideon asked, &quot;how can I save Israel? My clan is the weakest
in Manasseh, and I am the least in my family.&quot; 16 <B>The
LORD answered</B>, &quot;I will be with you, and you will strike
down all the Midianites together.&quot; (NIV) [Bold Mine]</I>

<P>
<I>Judges 13: 21 But the angel of the LORD did no more appear
to Manoah and to his wife. <B>Then Manoah knew that he was an
angel of the LORD</B>. 22 And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall
surely die, because<B> we have seen God</B>. [KJV] [Bold Mine]</I></blockquote>

<P>
These passages refer to the above passages:
<P>
<blockquote><I>See, I am sending an angel ahead of you to guard you along
the way and to bring you to the place I have prepared. Pay attention
to him and listen to what he says. Do not rebel against him; he
will not forgive your rebellion, since my Name is in him. If you
listen carefully to what he says and do all that I say, I will
be an enemy to your enemies and will oppose those who oppose you.
My angel will go ahead of you and bring you into the land of the
Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Canaanites, Hivites and Jebusites,
and I will wipe them out. (Exodus 23: 20-23) (NIV)</I> 
<P>
<I>Therefore now go, lead the people unto the place of which I
have spoken unto thee: behold, mine Angel shall go before thee:
nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon
them. (Exo 32:34)</I> </blockquote>
<P>
In the later two passages we see God the Father referring to the
Angel of the Lord in the above passages as a different person.
Yet in the prior three passages they are called God. This necessitates
that the person refereed to as God in the prior passages, while
as God, is different than the person of the Father, thus the Son.
<P>
<B>EXTRAORDINARY CASES OF THEOPHANY</B> 
<P>
<blockquote><I>And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld
his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full
of grace and truth. John bare witness of him, and cried, saying,
This was he of whom I spake, He that cometh after me is preferred
before me: for he was before me. And of his fulness have all we
received, and grace for grace. For the law was given by Moses,
but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ. No man hath seen God
at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the
Father, he hath declared him. (John 1:14 -18)</I> </blockquote>
<P>
The incarnation of Christ could and should be considered the ultimate
theophany. It is the last theophany humanity will encounter until
the return of Christ which will be the <I>theophany par excellence
</I>and the last with which humanity will have to do.
<P>
<blockquote><I>For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout,
with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and
the dead in Christ shall rise first: 17 Then we which are alive
and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds,
to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the
Lord. 18 Wherefore comfort one another with these words. (1 Thes
4:16-18)</I> </blockquote>
<P>
Conclusion
<P>
I think it is abundantly clear from scripture that the theophanies
of the Old Testament are clearly the preincarnate Christ. It is,
in my opinion, the only satisfactory conclusion we can make given
the evidence. Yet, as with other non-essential doctrines of our
faith, we are free on this subject to believe as we desire without
fear of committing some unpardonable sin.

As for my revised definition of a theophany: <I><B>A theophany
is a visual manifestation of God by, through, and in the Son.
</B></I>Thus &quot;if you have seen me you have seen the Father&quot;.
<P>
For this reason I wouldn't define theophanies, as some do, as
Christophanies. Where practically this is true, It leads one to
a less complete idea of what a theophany is. I think more is being
revealed than simply the presence of Christ although Christ is
the agent by which it is being revealed. We are, I believe, seeing
a glimpse into the shekinah glory of God in a theophany.
<UL>
<LI><I>Why wouldn't God show himself?</I> Probably because we
are so ready to make an idol of physical things that God knew
if we had an image of Him to dwell on, we probably would. We would
probably be seeing the object instead of consentrating on the
real thing. Look what we do with a crucifix!
<LI><I>Are all instances of theophany Christ?</I> I wouldn't argue
this point too strongly. It may be argued that the non-human appearances
of the glory of God, or the auditory ones, could be the Father.
This idea eliminates the difficulty of seeing God and perishing.
Although I would tend to see Christ as the agent by which God
worked in <I>all</I> cases, I wouldn't say dogmatically that this
is the case. This is another reason I shy away from using the
term Christophany.
