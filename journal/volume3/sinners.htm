&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The four Gospels tell us a great deal about Jesus and His dealings
with the Scribes of the Pharisees (and note, not scribes AND Pharisees).
They also tell us a great deal about His relationship with His
somewhat slow-of-wit disciples. (Now I don't mean to impugn the
disciples- but if you read the Gospels with at least one eye open
you discover that the disciples were singularly dense!). And the
Gospels also tell us! a great deal about Jesus and his work among
sinners. It is this last group that I am presently concerned with;
for I think that it is this group which is most like modern Americans.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There are, in fact, not many religious professionals today. At
least not as many per capita as lived in first century Palestine;
for that is what the Pharisees were. They were a group of men
dedicated, utterly, to the law and its fulfillment. And, in modern
America, there are not many disciples of Jesus floating around.
We may proclaim ourselves to be a Christian nation, but this is
hardly so in fact- for the very words Jesus uttered and which
were later collected in the &quot;Sermon on the Mount&quot; are
simply not adhered to by many Americans at all. (One thinks, for
instance, of the dictum; turn the other cheek. If you can find
one in one thousand among Church members who do this you have
found a treasure!).
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But there are quite a few &quot;sinners&quot; in modern America.
So it b!ehooves us to know what a sinner is and why it was this
particular &quot;people group&quot; which attracted so much of
Jesus' attention and compassion (for the astute reader of the
Gospels will know right away that Jesus had harsh things to say
to both disciples and Pharisees- but nothing of the kind for the
&quot;sinners&quot;!).
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What is a sinner, in the vocabulary of first century Judaism?
A sinner is simply a person who is apathetic to the law and disinterested
in its application to daily life. Thus, then as now, sinners are
folk who simply do not wish to, or try to, live out the fullness
of the will of God.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One can scarce turn a page in the four Gospels without running
smack dab into a sinner/ tax collector/ Samaritan. In Jesus' day
these were the folk looked down upon by the religious and ignored
by the powerful. Yet these are the very folk Jesus hangs out with!
He eats with them. He stays with them when he travels. He cares
about them. And he tried to! get his disciples to do the same
thing. In short, Jesus ministered to those who needed the great
physician. He cared about those who cared nothing for God or about
religious behavior! In doing so he showed them God's undying,
undeserved, love.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Modern American Christianity must recapture its master vision
of ministry. Instead of ministering to the up and coming and well
to do (which most do because they have the money to fund churches)
we should turn our eyes towards the gutters and reach out in the
name of Jesus to the &quot;sinners&quot; of our day; the drug
abusers, the alcoholics, the homosexuals, and the child abusers.
One, when thinking of Jesus, must surely picture him among these
people sharing the love of God rather than sitting in a finely
attired living room sipping tea with the ladies aid society.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who are the sinners? They are the folk who will never have time
for God until they realize that God has time for them. When will
they realize this? When the rather dull-of-wit disciples of Jesus
act like the!ir master instead of the Pharisees. <p>
