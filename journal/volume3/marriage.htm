&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Though there are some cultures in the Ancient Near East which
were matriarchal in structure, Israel's was not one of them. Israel's
family life was dominated by the husband (Pedersen, p. 61). When
a marriage occurred the husband took his wife from her home and
&quot;ruled&quot; over her, following the pattern of Genesis 3:16:
To the woman he said, &quot;I will greatly increase your pangs
in childbearing; in pain you shall bring forth children, yet your
desire shall be for your husband, and he shall rule over you.&quot;
(Preuss, p. 103). Yet the Israelites &quot;never went so far as
the Muhammadan poet who says that mothers of mankind are only
'vessels' which receive the children without leaving any impress
on them&quot; (Pedersen, p. 61).
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Because the husband was the dominant member of the family, he
was given the title of lib (Ba'al) which meant &quot;lord&quot;,
&quot;master of the house&quot;, &quot;leader of the family circle&quot;
and not &quot;master&quot; (which would have been ]da &quot;Adon&quot;)
Compare 2 Kings 5:13, Judges 18:19, and 2 Kings 2:12.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fact that some men remained single was an anomaly in ancient
Israel, as we learn from Jeremiah 16. After all, it &quot;is not
good for the man to be alone&quot;, and a good wife is a gift
from Yahweh (Pro. 18:22; Preuss, p. 104). We have, so far as I
know, no reports of women who are commanded to remain single in
Ancient Israel. Marriage was the norm.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The wife was to be taken from within the larger family circle
(usually at the outset of puberty or around the age of 13) in
order to maintain the purity of the family line; but she could
not be too closely related as is shown by Leviticus 18.
<P>
<blockquote>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You shall not do as they do in the land of Egypt, where you lived,
and you shall not do as they do in the land of Canaan, to which
I am bringing you. You shall not follow their statutes. My ordinances
you shall observe and my statutes you shall keep, following them:
I am the Lord your God. You shall keep my statutes and my ordinances;
by doing so one shall live: I am the Lord.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;None of you shall approach anyone near of kin to uncover nakedness:
I am the Lord.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father, which is the
nakedness of your mother; she is your mother, you shall not uncover
her nakedness. You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father's
wife; it is the nakedness of your father. You shall not uncover
the nakedness of your sister, your father's daughter or your mother's
daughter, whether born at home or born abroad.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You shall not uncover the nakedness of your son's daughter or
of your daughter's daughter, for their nakedness is your own nakedness.
You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father's wife's daughter,
begotten by your father, since she is your sister. You shall not
uncover the nakedness of your father's sister; she is your father's
flesh. You shall not uncover the nakedness of your mother's sister,
for she is your mother's flesh. You shall not uncover the nakedness
of your father's brother, that is, you shall not approach his
wife; she is your aunt. You shall not uncover the nakedness of
your daughter- in-law: she is your son's wife; you shall not uncover
her nakedness. You shall not uncover the nakedness of your brother's
wife; it is your brother's nakedness. You shall not uncover the
nakedness of a woman and her daughter, and you shall not take
her son's daughter or her daughter's daughter to uncover her nakedness;
they are your flesh; it is depravity.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And you shall not take a woman as a rival to her sister, uncovering
her nakedness while her sister is still alive.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You shall not approach a woman to uncover her nakedness while
she is in her menstrual uncleanness.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You shall not have sexual relations with your kinsman's wife,
and defile yourself with her.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You shall not give any of your offspring to sacrifice them to
Molech, and so profane the name of your God: I am the Lord.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You shall not have sexual relations with any animal and defile
yourself with it, nor shall any woman give herself to an animal
to have sexual relations with it: it is perversion.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Do not defile yourselves in any of these ways, for by all these
practices the nations I am casting out before you have defiled
themselves. Thus the land became defiled; and I punished it for
its iniquity, and the land vomited out its inhabitants. But you
shall keep my statutes and my ordinances and commit none of these
abominations, either the citizen or the alien who resides among
you (for the inhabitants of the land, who were before you, committed
all of these abominations, and the land became defiled); otherwise
the land will vomit you out for defiling it, as it vomited out
the nation that was before you. For whoever commits any of these
abominations shall be cut off from their people.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So keep my charge not to commit any of these abominations that
were done before you, and not to defile yourselves by them: I
am the Lord your God.</blockquote>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This text clearly shows that certain relationships are out of
bounds; because the practices described here were practiced by
the Canaanites. And since they worshipped foreign gods the Israelites
were not to imitate them in any respect. Not even their marriage
practices.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thus, in Israel the practice was to marry within the tribe -- and
if that was not possible, then within the larger tribal confederation
(Num 36:10ff). That marriages were often arranged is well known.
Yet these arrangements were not devoid of love (Gen 21:21, Judg
14:3, I Sam 18:17).
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The marriage was official when the betrothal took place. &quot;There
was no religious rite that was performed with the concluding of
the marriage, although there was a feast at the conclusion of
the festivities (Gen 29:27, Judg 14:10)&quot;(Preuss, p. 104).
A betrothed woman was, in the eyes of the people, legally married.
When the marriage itself was consumated the husband received the
wife and the family of the wife received a &quot;dowry&quot; (Pedersen,
p. 68). This payment was made because, as the wife's family had
given their flesh and blood the husband's family was bound to
gives order to maintain balance between the families. The payment
of the rhm (mohar, or &quot;dowry&quot;) was simply compensation
for the loss of the daughter's labor and should not be considered
as a wedding gift (Preuss, p. 104).
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Within the family circle the husband was the &quot;lord&quot;
while the wife was expected to &quot;help&quot; him by providing
the family with children (Pedersen, p. 69). The will of the husband
was binding on the whole family. If the wife wished to express
her wishes in contradistinction to the husband, she had to do
so slyly (as illustrated in the stories of Rebeccah (with Isaac)
and Abigail (with Nabal).
