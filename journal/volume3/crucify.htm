 Years ago Otto Betz wrote an intriguing article titled &quot;Jesus
and the Temple Scroll&quot;.  This article was published in a
book titled <I>Jesus and the Dead Sea Scrolls</I>.  But this book
is not widely available and the article is therefore virtually
unknown among people in the pew.
<P>
  The suggestions made by Betz deserve wider attention, however,
as they shed a great deal of light on a central event of the New
Testament, if not the central event of human existence.
<P>
  Betz begins his article by suggesting that what the New Testament
calls &quot;Herodians&quot; are in fact the Essenes of Qumran.
 He maintains that the Essenes were the favorite religious group
of Herod, and that they enjoyed special status among the people
during the reign of Herod (31- 4 BC).  Because of this he suggests
that the common people called the Essenes &quot;Herodians&quot;.
<P>
    Betz also suggests that these &quot;Herodians&quot; (which
were in fact the Essenes) were violently opposed to the religious
practices of Jesus.  As an example he points to Mark 3, which
reads in part,
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>  Again he entered the synagogue, and a man was there who had
a withered hand.  They watched him to see whether he would cure
him on the Sabbath, so that they might accuse him.    
<P>
 And he said to the man who had the withered hand, &quot;Come
forward.&quot;    
<P>
 Then he said to them, &quot;Is it lawful to do good or to do
harm on the Sabbath, to save life or to kill?&quot; But they were
silent.   He looked around at them with anger; he was grieved
at their hardness of heart and said to the man, &quot;Stretch
out your hand.&quot; He stretched it out, and his hand was restored.
  
<P>
 The Pharisees went out and immediately conspired with the Herodians
against him, how to destroy him.  </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 That they conspired to kill Jesus for this act will be discussed
shortly.  For now we will look at another example of why the Essenes
were so violently opposed to Jesus.  Mark 2:23-28 relates that
 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> One Sabbath he was going through the grainfields; and as they
made their way his disciples began to pluck heads of grain.
<P>
 The Pharisees said to him, &quot;Look, why are they doing what
is not lawful on the Sabbath?&quot;    
<P>
 And he said to them, &quot;Have you never read what David did
when he and his companions were hungry and in need of food?  
He entered the house of God, when Abiathar was high priest, and
ate the bread of the Presence, which it is not lawful for any
but the priests to eat, and he gave some to his companions.&quot;
 Then he said to them, &quot;The Sabbath was made for humankind,
and not humankind for the Sabbath;  so the Son of Man is lord
even of the Sabbath.&quot;  </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 These actions of Jesus, wandering through the field on the Sabbath
and plucking grain, are opposed to the practices of the Essenes
as we learn from the Damascus Document 10.20-21, which says :
  
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(Let no man walk in the field to do his workday business on the
Sabbath.  Let him not walk outside his town more than a 1000 cubits).</BLOCKQUOTE>
   
<P>
 Now what is significant about these actions of Jesus in regards
to the Sabbath is that, according to the Essene (and Pharisaic)
interpretation of Exodus 31:14, these actions are worthy of death.
 
<P>
 Exodus 31:14 says  
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> You shall keep the Sabbath, because it is holy for you; everyone
who profanes it shall be put to death; whoever does any work on
it shall be cut off from among the people.  </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 Betz now proceeds to show that the Temple Scroll is evidence
that the Jews practiced crucifixion against their own people during
the period of Jesus' lifetime.   In particular, column 64 describes
in some detail the Essene understanding of Deuteronomy 21:22-23
which says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> When someone is convicted of a crime punishable by death and
is executed, and you hang him on a tree, fall night upon the tree;
you shall bury him that same day, for anyone hung on a tree is
under God's curse. You must not defile the land that the Lord
your God is giving you for possession.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 The Essene interpretation of this passage is found in the Damascus
Document 64.6-12  
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> Thus you shall eradicate all evil in your midst, and all the
children of Israel shall hear it and fear.  If there were to be
a spy against his people who betrays his people to a foreign nation
or causes evil against his people, you shall crucify him and he
will die.  On the evidence of two witnesses and on the evidence
of three witnesses shall he be executed and they shall crucify
him.  If there were a man with a sin punishable by death and he
escapes amongst the nations and curses his people, the children
of Israel, he also you shall crucify and he shall die.  Their
corpses shall not spend the night on the tree; instead you shall
bury them that day because they are cursed by God and man, those
crucified; thus you shall not defile the land which I give you.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
  Perhaps the question has arisen in the reader's mind at this
point, &quot;what does this have to do with Jesus?&quot;  Well,
the New Testament bears witness to the fact that Jesus was executed
primarily because the Jews were angry at him because of his Sabbath
practices.  This Qumran text bears witness to the fact that crucifixion
was used against those who &quot;defiled&quot; the land; and Sabbath
breaking was defilement!  Such defilers are cursed by God!
<P>
  While it is clear that the Romans in fact crucified Jesus, that
the Jewish leadership participated is also undeniable.  Of course
the actual order was reserved for the Roman prefect.  But Jesus
was handed over for execution <I>after</I> the Jews had decided
that he must be executed.
<P>
    And why was he handed over?  For both his Sabbath activities
and his claim to be the Son of God.  John 19:7 records that the
Jews told Pilate (the prefect):
<P>
  
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> &quot;We have a law, and according to that law he ought to die
because he has claimed to be the Son of God.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 The Jews were concerned that a false claim to messiahship would
result in Roman intervention and the ultimate loss of their land
- and thus the ultimate defilement of the land by the Gentiles.
 In short, the 64th column of the Temple Scroll demonstrates that,
in the first century A.D.,  Sabbath breaking was punishable by
death.  It was for this reason that the &quot;Herodians&quot;
(i.e., the Essenes) and the Pharisees consulted together and decided
to have Jesus killed.
