<B>Was there modern technology before the Flood?</B><HR>

<P>
Were the people before Noah rude savages or had they managed to
build a complex, industrial society?
<P>
It is impossible to answer this question definitively, since the
Bible gives us very little detail about the times before the flood.
But there are a few hints.
<P>
Genesis 4:17-24 records the genealogy of Cain. In 4:22 the author
explains that Tubal-Cain forged all kinds of tools out of bronze
and iron. What is intriguing here is the simple fact that iron
making did not become common in the ancient near east until after
1200 BC. Archaeologically, it is possible to delineate the past
into periods of time based on the sorts of materials out of which
tools were principally made. Thus, in Palestine, the time breaks
down as follows (all dates are BC):<HR>

<P>
Pre-pottery Neolithic A c.8500-7500
<P>
Pre-pottery Neolithic B 7500-6000
<P>
Pottery Neolithic A 6000-5000
<P>
Pottery Neolithic B 5000-4300
<P>
Chalcolithic 4300-3300
<P>
Early Bronze I 3300-3050
<P>
Early Bronze II-III 3050-2300
<P>
Early IV/Middle Bronze I 2300-2000
<P>
Middle Bronze IIA 2000-1800/1750
<P>
Middle Bronze IIB-C 1800/1750-1550
<P>
Late Bronze I 1550-1400
<P>
Late Bronze IIA-B 1400-1200
<P>
Iron IA 1200-1150
<P>
Iron IB 1150-1000
<P>
Iron IIA 1000-925
<P>
Iron IIB 925-720
<P>
Iron IIC 720-586<HR>

<P>
Thus, it is clear that this time line must lie after the flood,
because if the genealogies in Genesis 5 and 10-11 were complete,
then the flood must date to about 2500 BC, putting Tubal-Cain
even earlier than that -- probably still in the stone age according
to archaeological evidence. He shouldn't even have been working
with bronze, let alone iron.
<P>
However, the genealogies in Genesis are demonstrably incomplete;
a flood in 2500 BC contradicts powerful and conclusive archaeological
evidence. There is also the odd fact that Abraham would have been
fifty years old when Noah died, and Shem would have outlived Abraham
-- both highly improbable -- if the genealogies in Genesis 5 and
10-11 are complete.
<P>
This means, therefore, that the flood must date to a period before
8500 BC; how far in the past, it is impossible to be definite
about. However, if Tubal-Cain is any indication, then technological
development prior to the flood was rapid and different from what
we see by the archaeological evidence, which we assume is all
post-flood.
<P>
Conservatively, if there were no gaps in the genealogies of Genesis
5, then there are at least 2000 years between Adam and the time
of Noah. Consider, that these people were living to an average
age of more than 900 and that they were all speaking a single
language. Then consider that the industrial revolution occurred
only in the middle of the 19th century, with the introduction
of the steam engine. How much progress have we made in only about
a hundred and fifty years?
<P>
It seems like a strong possibility, therefore, that the people
before the flood were highly developed technologically, perhaps
even more developed than we are. This is not as fanciful as it
might seem. Consider some of the clues:
<P>
a. No other ships the size of the ark were built until the end
of the 19th century.
<P>
b. The question of how Noah and his family could care for the
million or so species of land animals that would have had to be
on the ark is explainable if they carried the animals as frozen
embryos or if they were carried in some sort of suspended animation.
Otherwise, there would be some difficulty in having enough room
and food to last a full year, to keep all those animals in good
health. While a million animals would fit crowded into tiny cubicles,
without any room to move, it is questionable that they would survive
for a full year. Certainly you can get a lot of sheep in a boxcar,
but you leave them for a year crowded like that, even if they
have food and water, it is not likely that they would survive.
<P>
As to why none of the pre-flood advanced technology survived,
consider: if you and your family were the sole survivors of a
nuclear holocaust, how much of modern civilization and technology
could you reproduce? Could you mine metal, refine it, mold it
and build a car from scratch? How about a computer?
<P>
Noah and his family survived the equivalent of a nuclear holocaust
-- in fact, for all we know there might have been one just before
the flood. Radiation poisoning and the resultant genetic damage
would go a long way in explaining why human life spans, which
before the flood averaged over 900 years, declined rapidly to
their current levels after the flood. <HR>
