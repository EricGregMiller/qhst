<HR>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In George Orwell's fable of the Russian revolution, <I> Animal
Farm</I>, he describes an animal society borne out of revolt against
the tyrannical rule of the owner of the farm. In their uprising
the animals unify themselves under a spirit of equality and shared
hardship from which springs the foundation of their newfound society.
After the overthrow of the old master, a meeting is convened and
the pigs, having learned to read and write, explain to the rest
of the animals that they had succeeded in reducing the precepts
of &quot;Animalism&quot; to Seven Commandments, commandments that
will prevent them from ever having to live under the yoke of their
human oppressors again.<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; These Seven Commandments would now be inscribed on the wall; they
would form an unalterable law by which all the animals on Animal
Farm must live for ever after. With some difficulty (for it is
not easy for a pig to balance himself on a ladder) Snowball climbed
up and set to work, with Squealer a few rungs below him holding
the paint-pot. The commandments were written on the tarred wall
in great white letters that could be read thirty yards away. They
ran thus:
<p>
<blockquote>
THE SEVEN COMMANDMENTS
<br>
1. <I> Whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy.
<br>
2. Whatever goes upon four legs, or has wings, is a friend.
<br>
3. No animal shall wear clothes. 
<br>
4. No animal shall sleep in a bed. 
<br>
5. No animal shall drink alcohol.
<br>
6. No animal shall kill any other animal.
<br>
7. All animals are equal</I>. <br>
(George Orwell.  <I>Animal Farm</I>,
New York: Signet Classics.  1946, pp. 32-33)
</blockquote></blockquote>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Over time, human nature (or should I say animal nature?) began
to take its course. The pigs began to realize just how easily
the other animals could be manipulated, and began exploiting the
other animals for their own gain through scare tactics and by
distorting the truth through altering the commandments. Over time
it became increasingly difficult for the other animals to comprehend
what had actually been gained as a result of their rebellion.
Had they truly been liberated from their tyrannical former master,
or had they just found a new tyrannical master?
<p>
<blockquote>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For a minute or two they stood gazing at the tarred wall with
its white lettering.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;My sight is failing,&quot; she said finally. &quot;Even
when I was young I could not have read what was written there.
But it appears to me that that wall looks different. Are the Seven
Commandments the same as they used to be, Benjamin?&quot;
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For once Benjamin consented to break his rule, and he read out
to her what was written on the wall. There was nothing there now
except for a single Commandment. It ran:
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ALL ANIMALS ARE EQUAL
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; BUT SOME ANIMALS ARE MORE EQUAL THAN OTHERS (Orwell, p. 123)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now look at some of the headlines that we read of daily.
<UL>
<LI><I>Paul Hill, a former Presbyterian minister, was sentenced
to death for the shotgun slayings of a Pensecola abortion doctor
and his bodyguard. </I>
<LI><I>Local churches speak out against the &quot;Gay Agenda.&quot;
Pronounce homosexuals as sinners bound for hell. </I>
<LI><I>John Salvi is arrested for the slaying of two abortion
clinic workers and the wounding of others in a Christmas day shooting
rampage. </I>
</UL>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sound familiar? Could it be that some people are more moral than
others? While the majority of Christians would denounce these
tactics as extremist, the attitudes on which they are founded
are discernable on lower (and not quite so newsworthy) levels;
though attitudes may not be actions, they are just as damaging
in our local churches. There is only one bullet separating an
attitude from an action. And yet as Christians we are expressly
commanded not to render self-righteous judgments:<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Jesus replied: &quot;'Love the Lord your God with all your heart
and with all your soul and with all your mind.' This is the first
and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: 'Love your
neighbor as yourself.' All the Law and the Prophets hang on these
two commandments.&quot; (Matthew 22:37-40)
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved
you, so you must love one another. By this all men will know that
you are my disciples, if you love one another.&quot; (John 13:34-35)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Have we distorted the meaning and intent of our Lord's commandment
to the point that the good news of salvation from our fallen condition,
has been laid aside for hate monger preaching and politics that
condemn any who think or act differently from the way we do?
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is our memory so faded and hazy as to forget the depth from which
we have been pulled? Why is it so hard to accept the fact that
when an individual, who has not entered into a personal relationship
with God, engages in reprehensible activity, he does so because
there is nothing within him to make him desire anything different?
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When Jesus was preaching the sermon on the mount, one of the contrasts
He made was in the way the world loves compared to the way a Christian
should love:<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But I tell you: Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute
you, that you may be sons of your Father in heaven. He causes
his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the
righteous and the unrighteous. If you love those who love you,
what reward will you get? Are not even the tax collectors doing
that? And if you greet only your brothers, what are you doing
more than others? Do not even pagans do that? (Matthew 5:44-47)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When a Christian's love is expressed only to those like themselves,
what have they done that's any different than the rest of society?
Do not even the pagans do that? When we clique with others like
us the natural result is the dehumanizing of anyone not calling
themselves Christians. We do this by calling them &quot;them&quot;
and then placing &quot;them&quot; into nice neat little categories
segregated by their respective symptom of depravity. Sin is then
defined as anything &quot;we&quot; don't do. &quot;They&quot;
become an enemy, something to fight against, a cause, a rallying
point for the troops and a scapegoat for all that ails society
and the human race. We have taken Romans 3:23<I>, For all have
sinned, and fall short of the glory of God</I> -- the root of
the problem with the human race and the basis of our need for
a Savior who was beyond that problem -- and we have added our
own self-righteous twist: <I>some have sinned more and fallen
shorter than others</I>. It is as if on the side of the Church
it is written:<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
ALL PEOPLE ARE IMMORAL
<br>
BUT SOME PEOPLE ARE MORE IMMORAL THAN OTHERS
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Instead of illuminating the dark places we stay far away from
them and place more candles in our own safe haven until we are
in danger of burning the place down. Instead of having a holiness
that is inspired by God and able to co-exist with the world without
being a part of, or in love with the world, we create our own
holiness based on our own strengths and our own ability to modify
our behavior. If we want to condemn sin then we must be willing
to condemn <I>all</I> sin: from murder, to failing to love God.
If we are willing to kill an abortion doctor, or protest a gay
rights rally, then we must also be willing to kill an adherent
to any religion other than Christianity and picket our neighbors'
house if they are living together out of wedlock. Consider how
we denounce alcohol while embracing gluttony! Why do we make this
distinction? Because for most of us, it's easier to quit drinking
than to quit eating. When will we realize that the distinction
we make is not shared by God?<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Do not join those who drink too much wine or gorge themselves
on meat, for drunkards and gluttons become poor, and drowsiness
clothes them in rags. (Proverbs 23:20-21)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How is it that the Church can set levels of morality on the rest
of the population while ignoring its own shortcomings? It is a
matter of semantics and self-righteousness (understanding, of
course, that the root cause is our genetic link to Adam).
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I say semantics because Christians can set their own morality
simply by redefining words. Have you ever heard a Christian say
&quot;I was a sinner, but I was <I>never immoral.</I>&quot; The
person making this statement believes it to be true because they
define &quot;immorality&quot; as having to do with sex. In reality,
immorality is simply the inability to discern right and wrong.
Illicit sex does not have a monopoly on this word. You are immoral
if you have ever chosen the wrong thing over the right thing.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Redefining our language to fit our lifestyles is nothing strange
or new, of course, for this is the very essence of self-righteousness.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Self-righteousness can be defined as: &quot;I think I'm right,
therefore I must be right&quot;; it can also be defined as selfishness
or self-justification. It is a person's ability to perceive all
things in relation to and revolving around himself personally.
This shouldn't come as a big surprise to us, since we acknowledge
this very human trait in all children. Children are unashamedly
egocentric; it is only as they grow older, that they learn --
not how to overcome, but, how to hide -- that egocentric trait
and to doublespeak those natural tendencies. And again, this is
not something new to humanity. The very first act of self-righteousness
occurred in the garden of Eden. It was there that Adam and Eve
chose to do what they thought was right even though God had expressly
told them not to and warned them of the dangers of doing so. It
is no small stretch to say that all people who have ever lived
on the planet, who are living on the planet and who will ever
live on the planet are self-righteous. Only through Jesus Christ
can this ego problem be placed under control and ultimately eliminated
altogether.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The results of this judgmental behavior on the part of Christians
not only ignores the gospel, but if left unrepented of, it becomes
antagonistic to the gospel. Instead of reaching out to the lost,
we repel them.<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites!
You shut the kingdom of heaven in men's faces. You yourselves
do not enter, nor will you let those enter who are trying to.
(Matthew 23:13)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am reminded of the scenario in Shakespeare's comedy <I>The Merchant
of Venice</I>, where Salerio asks Shylock (a victim of anti-semitism)
if he will really take a pound of Antonio's flesh should he default
on his loan. After all what good is a pound of flesh to anybody?
Shylock replies with bitterness:<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;To bait fish withal. If it will feed nothing else, it will
feed my revenge. He hath disgrac'd me and hind'red me half a million;
laugh'd at my losses, mock'd at my gains, scorned my nation, thwarted
my bargains, cooled my friends, heated mine enemies. And what's
his reason? I am a Jew. Hath not a Jew eyes?
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections,
passions, fed with the same food, hurt with the same weapons,
subject to the same diseases, healed by the same means, warmed
and cooled by the same winter and summer, as a Christian is? If
you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh?
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If you poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall we
not revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will resemble
you in that. If a Jew wrong a Christian, what is his humility?
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Revenge. If a Christian wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance
be by Christian example? Why, revenge. The villainy you teach
me I will execute; and it shall go hard but I will better the
instruction.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shylock's point is well taken: &quot;The villainy you teach me
I will execute.&quot; The spirit of this statement is also found
in Jesus' warning to the religious leaders of His day:<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites!
You travel over land and sea to win a single convert, and when
he becomes one, you make him twice as much a son of Hell as you
are. (Matthew 23:15)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Most expositors deal with this passage on a surface level, describing
the religious leaders' efforts at finding and getting a person
to think and believe like they do, thereby making them twice as
much a son of Hell. I believe there is also a more subtle twist
that Jesus was alluding to and that is what happens to the ones
they <I>can't</I> get to think like them: do they become any less
a son of Hell? Not at all, for they too become just as much a
son of Hell, if not more for in their preaching, the Pharisees
have succeeded in building a wall separating &quot;us&quot; from
&quot;them&quot;, and no common ground can ever again be found;
the walls of prejudice have succeeded in making those who reject,
an enemy.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Because of the walls we have raised against homosexuals, you will
be hard-pressed to find a gay man or woman who is willing to listen
to anything a Christian has to say. Because of the walls raised
against pro-choicers, we will never have credibility in their
eyes. Their sin problem has now been compounded by generations
of hate and segregation just because we find their particular
symptom of the fall worse than others. These people are now strengthened
in their resolve, and battle lines are drawn, and they are further
from the truth than ever before: &quot;The villainy you teach
me I will execute!&quot;
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A while back, I happened to catch a 20/20 interview with Charles
Manson and some of his followers. Interestingly, his followers
have all denounced him and have apparently repented of their actions.
Diane Sawyer, who was conducting the interview, talked with Vincent
Bugliosi, the prosecuting attorney. When asked if he thought that
these Manson women should be paroled, he responded that there
is something in them, that is not in us, that would allow them
to commit such a grisly crime; he insisted that most of us could
never do such a thing.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Baloney, baloney, baloney! The same thing is inside all of us
-- it just takes different perspectives to unleash it. Consider
the Balkan wars. These are people just like us who are annihilating
one another without any good reason. Consider some of the comments
from people regarding the recent Susan Smith tragedy. I even found
myself designing horrific ways of torturing and killing her that
would sufficiently repay her for the horrible way she killed her
children. Consider the reaction to the slaying of Jeffery Dahmer.
One woman called his murderer, (another convicted murderer) a
hero.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No, Mister Bugliosi: call a man your enemy, and it becomes quite
easy to justify your actions no matter how extreme they may be.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The creation of enemies <I>is</I> the creation of war. There can
be no war where there are not people who consider each other enemies.
Because of the perceived war against the world that &quot;we&quot;
are fighting, the Church is forever portrayed in the media as
fools and friends of fools. But one can't help seeing that the
punishment fits the crime. We are not made fun of and criticized
because we won't relent in our message of love and salvation,
we are criticized because we are forever forgetting the precepts
of salvation -- and resorting to ridicule and judgment of all
&quot;them&quot; sinners. It is one thing for a Christian to be
beat up while faithfully following Christ; it is quite another
to receive the beating you deserve.<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But how is it to your credit if you receive a beating for doing
wrong and endure it? But if you suffer for doing good and you
endure it, this is commendable before God. (1 Peter 2:20)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; More than ever we must never forget that &quot;we&quot; are, fundamentally,
no different than &quot;them&quot;. To be more specific, what
is the difference between a convicted murderer on death row who
has been pardoned -- and a convicted murderer on death row who
hasn't? Are they not both murderers? Do they not both deserve
death? The only difference is that one of the murderers has been
given a second chance, but that second chance does not give him
the right to throw stones. On the other hand that second chance
doesn't give him the right to resume his life of crime, either.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But again, some Christians may say that they are very moral --
that is, they do not steal, they don't murder, they don't commit
adultery, etc. They argue that there is a vast gulf separating
the sweet little old lady who donates her time and money to helping
those less fortunate than herself and a Jeffrey Dahmer or Charles
Manson.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Friends, that gulf exists only in our own subjective morality.
<I>God does not make that distinction.</I> Consider what James
wrote:<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point
is guilty of breaking all of it. (James 2:10)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To understand what James is talking about consider our current
scientific method:<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; One of the basic principles of scientific testing can therefore
be stated roughly in the following manner: the outcome of a certain
test cannot confirm a theory unless it is logically possible that
there could be another outcome that would have disconfirmed the
theory.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Simply put, a theory can continue to be trusted the longer it
withstands attempts to disprove it. However, if a particular theory
&quot;passes&quot; the first 99 tests but fails on the 100th the
whole theory, in its existing form, is invalid and it's back to
the drawing board for reworking and adjustment. Likewise there
is no measurement for lesser or greater sins, because it is quite
clear that failing in just one little area, no matter how insignificant,
invalidates the theory of our &quot;inherent morality&quot;. And
like a scientific theory, we must either be scrapped or modified.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Take this a step further -- all the way back to the garden of
Eden. If the prototypes of humanity, Adam and Eve, failed to discern
the right thing, making them imperfect or fallen, then what kind
of children will they produce? If this &quot;bad&quot; choice
changed them physically, and henceforth genetically, then what
are the ramifications for their descendants who will inherit half
of each of their parents' genetic blueprint? The obvious conclusion
is that the imperfect prototypes will produce imperfect children,
who will have imperfect grandchildren, and imperfect great-grandchildren,
and so on, up to our present generation. Some Christians are very
bored with the genealogies in Genesis, but part of their purpose
was to illustrate this very point:<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When Adam had lived 130 years, he had a son <I>in his own likeness,
in his own image</I>; and he named him Seth...
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Altogether, Adam lived 930 years, <I>and then he died</I>...
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Altogether, Seth lived 912 years, <I>and then he died</I>...
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Altogether, Enosh lived 905 years, <I>and then he died</I>. (Gen
5:3-11)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And then they died and then they died and then they died -- and
they have been dying ever since. Part of the reason that the majority
of people fight death is because they know that there should be
something else. Solomon wrote that &quot;He has also set eternity
in the hearts of men; yet they cannot fathom what God has done
from beginning to end.&quot; (Ecclesiastes 3:11)
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What then is the difference between &quot;us&quot; and &quot;them&quot;?
It is in our sanctification, our being set apart by grace, through
faith in the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ, and
the resultant gift of the Holy Spirit.<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What is more, I consider everything a loss compared to the surpassing
greatness of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whose sake I have
lost all things. I consider them rubbish, that I may gain Christ
and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that
comes from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ
-- the righteousness that comes from God and is by faith. (Philippians
3:8-9)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Only Jesus, who is God, could die in our place and suffer our
punishment brought on by the sin of Adam and offer us a rebirth
through His resurrection from the dead.<p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This act of being set apart or redeemed by the grace of God is
what naturally separates us from the world. But like the pardoned
murderer it gives us no right to either cast stones or to continue
in our former ways. On the contrary, it gives us hope and changes
our sinful desires. Where once we had no hope and had no choice,
now through the sanctification of the Holy Spirit, we have been
given both hope and a brand new desire that results in good deeds.<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith -- and this
not from yourselves, it is the gift of God -- not by works, so
that no one can boast. For we are God's workmanship, created in
Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for
us to do. (Ephesians 2:8-10)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Those good deeds are the results of our reconciled relationship
with God through Jesus Christ. Now, instead of only being able
to guess about right and wrong, we have the choice of obeying
the voice of our Lord and Savior and choosing that which is right
(not because we decided it was right, but because God determined
it was right). But we must not forget that this is not an option
for those who have not been liberated by grace through faith in
Jesus Christ:<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When you were slaves to sin, you were free from the control of
righteousness. What benefit did you reap at that time from the
things you are now ashamed of? Those things result in death! But
now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves
to God, the benefit you reap leads to holiness, and the result
is eternal life. For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of
God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. (Romans 6:20-23)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So how can Christians continue to tolerate and be fooled by the
politics of hate and segregation brought on by self-righteousness?
And where will it end? The answers lie in the response of Christians
to God's truth. The Bible is God's special revelation to His chosen
people and it speaks the truth to us on these very matters and
only as these answers are given to us, can we take them to heart
and ask God to change our attitudes in order that the Church might
be better equipped to be ambassadors of God, bringing a message
of reconciliation to a condemned world.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At the end of the book, <I>Animal Farm,</I> the pigs have degenerated
into the very creatures they had rebelled against: they are living
in the house, sleeping in the bed, doing business with other humans,
wearing human clothes and walking on two feet. A few of the animals
who were survivors of the original rebellion observed the following:<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But as the animals outside gazed at the scene, it seemed to them
than some strange thing was happening. What was it that had altered
in the faces of the pigs? Clover's old dim eyes flitted from one
face to another. Some of them had five chins, some had four, some
had three. But what was it that seemed to be melting and changing?
Then the applause having come to an end, the company took up their
cards and continued the game that had been interrupted, and the
animals crept silently away.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But they had not gone twenty yards when they stopped short. An
uproar of voices was coming from the farmhouse. They rushed back
and looked through the window again. Yes, a violent quarrel was
in progress. There were shoutings, bangings on the table, sharp
suspicious glances, furious denials. The source of the trouble
appeared to be that Napoleon and Mr. Pinkerton had each played
an ace of spades simultaneously.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Twelve voices were shouting in anger, and they were all alike.
No question, now, what had happened to the faces of the pigs.
<I>The creatures outside looked from pig to man,and from man to
pig, and from pig to man again; but already it was impossible
to say which was which</I>. (Orwell, p. 128)

<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I can't help but recognize the similarity as our neighbors look
from the faces of Christians to the faces of the world, and from
the faces of the world back to the faces of Christians. Will they
be able to tell which is which? You'd better hope so.<p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy
in your name, and in your name drive out demons and perform many
miracles?' Then I will tell them plainly, 'I never knew you. Away
from me, you evildoers!' (Matthew 7:22-23)

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b><i><h3>The Complaint of Jacob</i> by R.P. Nettelhorst</h3></b>  
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jacob’s life was not a particularly easy one and his family life, both growing up, and then as an adult was certainly what would fit the modern definition of being “dysfunctional.”  <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So, to say the least, Jacob was not at all happy.  The one true love of his life was dead.  Joseph, his favorite, the oldest son of his beloved, had been dead for twenty-five years.  And now Simeon had been taken from him, and this monster in Egypt was demanding the last link he had to his dead lover.  Beside himself with grief, we find his reaction in Genesis 42:36 where it all comes down to this:<p>
<blockquote>
Their father Jacob said to them, "You have deprived me of my children. Joseph is no more and Simeon is no more, and now you want to take Benjamin. Everything is against me!" 
</blockquote><p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And certainly it was the case that the circumstances of his life, from his perspective, from the perspective of his sons standing around him, made his complaint fully reasonable and perfectly understandable.
And yet, the fascinating thing about his words, for those of us reading the story, is that we know that he couldn’t be more wrong, despite the fact that his words seemed so obviously true to Jacob – unassailably true, in fact.  But we the readers of this little episode, know something that Jacob doesn’t: we know that Joseph is not only not dead, but he is second in command in Egypt, the most powerful and most wealthy nation on the planet at that time.  We also know that there’s no way for poor Jacob to know that.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So the reality of Jacob’s existence is that everything could hardly be better.  His favorite son has done very well for himself, thank you.  Good job, and great future, with money to burn.   Poor Jacob simply doesn’t know this yet.  His perception, his perspective of reality, is incorrect.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And we, the readers, can do nothing to alleviate Jacob’s suffering just now. And God didn’t do anything about it either.  It’ll be another year before Jacob learns the truth of what his life is really like.  For twenty-five years he mourned for someone who was not dead at all.  He bemoans his fate as a miserable one, though his family is absolutely powerful and prosperous.  But he doesn’t know any of that; in fact, he has no way of knowing any of that.

<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;September 11, 2001 was thus an exceptionally bad day (to say the least) and raised numerous questions in the minds of many people about the nature of existence, about the goodness of God, about what it is really, that God wants and expects out of all of us.  How do we live in a world where this sort of thing can happen?  How do we face the crises of life, both small and great?  Is there some key to life, some playbook we can get, some list we can follow, some formula we can memorize that will get us through life in one piece, with ourselves and our families living productive and prosperous lives?  What does Jacob's complaint tell us about our relationship to God and the world?

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b><i><h3>John of the Apocalypse</i> by R.P. Nettelhorst</h3></b>  

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If everything in your life went wrong, wouldn’t it be nice if Jesus came and told you why? “Why doesn’t God do something?” It was a question heavy on John’s mind. He had seen all his companions bleed and die; thousands of his compatriots had been slaughtered by a brutal tyranny. It seemed such an odd way for God to treat his most faithful servants. John was just a lonely old man exiled for his beliefs on the island of Patmos. And then Jesus unexpectedly showed up with good news and an explanation.
