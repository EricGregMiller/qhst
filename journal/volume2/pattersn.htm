&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Don Patterson is the Senior Pastor of <A HREF="church.htm">Quartz Hill Community Church</A> and President of <A HREF="http://www.theology.edu">Quartz Hill School of Theology</A>.  He has pastored and ministered to churches in California and Arkansas for the past twenty-two years.  He holds a BA from <A HREF="http://www.calbaptist.edu">California Baptist University</A> in Riverside and an MDiv from <A HREF="http://www.ggbts.edu">Golden Gate Baptist Theological Seminary</A> in Mill Valley, California.  Cartooning, novel writing, and back road "exploring" take up his precious moments of free time.  For the past eight years he has lived in Quartz Hill with his wife Karen, an elementary teacher at Desert Christian School, and two typically rambunctious teenage sons.<P>
