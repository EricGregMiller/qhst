<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-indent:.5in'>There is something within mankind
that makes him wonder at the world in which he finds himself; a curiosity that
keeps him searching and questing for some answer to the mystery that is
God.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>For ages men have tried to access
the mind behind the order and design implicit within the complex beauty of
creation. Philosophers, theologians, mystics and even mathematicians try to
find some answer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Poets look and see
the enigmas, but in facing them, leave the questions unanswered and open to
many possibilities. Wallace Stevens faces the mystery of God in his poem “13
Ways of Looking at a Blackbird.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In it,
Stevens vignettes 13 scenes linked only the presence of a blackbird. Using the
blackbird as a symbol to represent God, Stevens suggests the transcendence of
God in relation to his creation. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-indent:.5in'>In a close reading of this poem
we can see the different aspects of God’s transcendence revealed within the
scenes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Transcendence has a very
specific meaning in this context: God is all-knowing, all-powerful and
ever-present to his creation and existing outside of time.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We will look at each scene to see which
aspect of God’s transcendence is implied and what literary techniques he
utilizes to create that impression.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>           </span>In scene I we see the blackbird
gazing upon a mountain range:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-left:.5in'>Among twenty snowy mountains,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-left:.5in'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-indent:.5in'>The image created is one of a
vast wilderness in which only the blackbird is alive. The use of the past tense
word “Was” alludes to the creation of the world. The terrain was formed and not
yet filled with life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The blackbird –
God -- watched over it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The statement
that the eye of the blackbird was “moving” evokes a sense that God was not only
present at the creation of the world, but was interested in it.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Where stanza I stresses God’s presence in
the vast openness of the world, Scene II demonstrates how God is present even
within each individual.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-indent:.5in'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-left:.5in'>I was of three minds</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-left:.5in'>Like a tree</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-left:.5in'>In which there are three
blackbirds</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-left:.5in'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-indent:.5in'>This is a clear reference to the
Christian Doctrine of the Trinity. The idea of the Father, the Son and the Holy
Spirit as three persons in One God is pictured as a tree with three blackbirds
perching in it. This tree is used as a simile to describe the persona’s state
of mind: being three in one.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This may
be a reference to the idea of mankind being like God in that he is body, mind
and spirit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>These first two scenes
demonstrate that God is present among the vastness of the landscape as well as
within the design of a single man. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In stanza
III we see God is even present in the smallest things.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“The blackbird whirled in the autumn winds.
It was a small part of the pantomime.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>This image evokes a playful kind of feeling with the use of words like
“whirled” and “pantomime.” The wind is used as a metaphor for the invisible
things. The blackbird playing in the wind is a small part of the pantomime and
implies that God’s involvement with the invisible things is only a small part
of what He does. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>This idea is expanded
in the next stanza, Scene IV, where we see God’s presence in the relationship
between two people. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:.5in'>A man and a

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:.5in'>Are one.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:.5in'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-indent:.5in'>This is an obvious allusion to the
Biblical teaching of marriage “and the two will become one flesh
(Gen.2:24).”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In adding the blackbird to
the union of man and woman, Stevens is again alluding to the “three as one” Trinity
idea as well as implying that God’s presence is a part of that special union of
marriage.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In the
preceding stanza’s we have seen how God is present somewhat passively in his
creation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In the stanzas V - VII we see
that his presence is more active. In V the persona muses about his
preferences:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“ I do not know which to
prefer; The beauty of inflections; Or the beauty of innuendoes.”<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>The persona points to communication and
wonders about the beauty of its parts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Inflections are how the person speaking manipulates sound to create a
desired emotional effect in the listener.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>This practice, done skillfully, can be as lyrical and pleasing to the
listener as the melody of a song. The listener is not required to do anything
in this kind of communication but feel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>However, a speaker’s artful use of innuendo requires that the listener
actively juggle what is said so that an alternative meaning is understood.
Stevens couples this picture of passive and active listening with “…The
blackbird whistling; Or just after.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The blackbird whistling suggests God speaking. One can listen to the
preaching of scripture and be moved by the beauty of the verses and the truth
that they contain.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>But merely hearing
God’s words does not require any response from the listener.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It is in the moments after God speaks that
the listener is required to act; to respond in some way to the truth that they
have heard.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This exchange in
communication demonstrates a more interactive involvement between God and his
creation; that God is not only present but involved with His world. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Not only is
God involved, but he also is deeply concerned for his creation.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In stanza VI we see that God is present in
the extraordinary things in life, such as tragedy. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-left:1.0in'>Icicles filled the long window, </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-indent:.5in'>We get the sense of tragedy from
the imagery Stevens uses in the first two lines.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>The words “icicles” and “barbaric glass” brings with them the
feeling of cold, unmerciful harshness: the kind of feeling that accompanies
those unexpected events in life that leave one asking “why me?”<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This time it is not the blackbird that is
seen, but its shadow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It is in times of
despair when God does not seem to be present, but Stevens seems to suggest by
the blackbird’s shadow that God is present even then.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>The moving of the shadow back and forth across the window echoes
the pacing actions of one who is anxious but cannot take action.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This leaves the impression that God is
present and emotionally involved in the extraordinary event.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The final lines, “The mood; Traced in the
shadow; An indecipherable cause”, implies that God is sensitive to the
suffering and that He is present even though He offers no explanation for the
suffering. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Where
stanza VI shows how God is present in the extraordinary events in life, stanza
VII shows that God is present in the ordinary things of daily living. The
persona addresses the men of the city asking them :</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>          </span>Steven’s use of the color “golden”
evokes images of the opulent and lavish ornamentation that is found in
cathedrals and other traditional places of worship. This is the key to understanding
Steven’s choice of the blackbird to symbolize God. This stark contrast between
the opulence and splendor of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“golden
birds” and the somewhat ugly ordinariness of the blackbird argues, most
effectively, Steven’s desire to represent God as someone who is near and
approachable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He further brings this
purpose to light by pointing to the presence of the blackbird at the “feet of
the women.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This choice of words
carries with it some very strong domestic feelings. It draws to mind the
picture of a woman, barefoot and pregnant, taking care of the home.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Here Steven’s seems to be telling the men to
look to the ordinary things in life, not the formal and elaborate structures of
religion, to experience God. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-indent:.5in'>Up to this point Steven’s has
concentrated on the ever-present aspect of God’s transcendence.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>But in stanzas VIII and IX he moves to
addressing God’s transcendent knowledge.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

of flight symbolizes authority over the creation, or sovereignty.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>So, the impression we get is that the man,
in his pride, has elevated himself to the place of God.<span

realization happened when he mistook the shadows, cast by the framework of his
carriage, for blackbirds.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In reflecting
God’s sovereignty, these stanzas help to demonstrate the all-powerful aspect of
God’s transcendence. The final two stanza’s however, demonstrate more clearly
the power of God and his existence apart from time. In XII Stevens sees a cause
and effect relationship between God’s power and the movement of life through
time. </p>

thing and represents time. The water is used as a symbol of life. From this
understanding that “life goes on”, the persona concludes that God must still be
actively governing his creation and that he holds the power of life and the
passage of time in his hands. The implication of this is the converse: if God
stops governing the creation, life will stop moving through time.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This single stanza powerfully argues for not
only the power of God, but also God’s existence outside of time.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>This stopping of time: death, is captured
in the final stanza, XIII, where we are faced with a dreary, cold picture.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-indent:.5in'>“It was evening all afternoon”
shows that the passage of time has halted. The darkness of evening and the
coldness of the constant fall of snow evoke a somewhat sad and hopeless
feeling. This winter scene is a metaphor for death. Yet even in death, God is
present.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The blackbird perching in the
branches of the cedar is contrasted to the flight of the blackbird in the
previous stanza.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This contrast serves
to re-enforce the power that God holds over his creation.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>When he stops governing, time and life
stops. </p>

God in all of life’s experiences and not only in the vaulted ceilings of a
