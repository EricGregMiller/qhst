As a student, she has taken classes in literature at Antelope Valley College in Lancaster, California, and in Bible, Theology and Hebrew at Quartz Hill School of Theology in Quartz Hill, California.  She has contributed several articles and poems to the Quartz Hill Journal of Theology and has an abiding interest in finding the truth, no matter where it might lead.  She also edits the novels of R.P. Nettelhorst.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I have enjoyed two decades of study and teaching related to the Bible, its history and its composition and contents. Besides being immersed in the Gospel texts, I have investigated the history of early Christianity, its roots in Judaism and the various influences in the ancient world that shaped it. Over the course of my studies, I have acquired the Biblical languages of Hebrew, Greek and Aramaic as well as modern languages, French and German, necessary to study the scholarly literature in the field.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In addition to my responsibilities as pastor of the First Baptist Church of Petros, in Tennessee, I am the Adjunct Professor of Biblical Studies at the Quartz Hill School of Theology. I have penned abstracts, book reviews, articles and dictionary entries on a wide range of Biblical studies, participate actively in the Society of Biblical Literature and the Catholic Biblical Association, and am a member of the famed -- or infamous, depending on one’s perspective -- Jesus Seminar.</P>
