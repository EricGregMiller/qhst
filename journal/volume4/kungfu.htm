<p class=MsoTitle>Life and Kung Fu</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>By <A href="mailto:dandi@theology.edu">Dandi Moyers</A></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>When life becomes difficult and
threatens to overwhelm I often take comfort in knowing that when the storms
have passed, I will have learned something valuable about life or myself, or
God. The past six months have been such a time for me. There have been days
that it seemed as though all would be well and I could enjoy every
blessing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>But there have been others
when I have let myself become consumed by fear and worry. I could recount for
you the circumstances of this crisis, but that is not the intention of this
missive. Instead I would like to tell about what I am learning through it
all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Specifically, how I am learning to
understand some basic life lessons through these circumstances and how they can
help my training in Kung Fu. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>It seems to me that when times get
tough we have a few choices to make in response. We can give up, which in life
would be either running away or dying.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>We can choose to face the trial with bitterness, whining and complaining.
Or we can choose to face it with grace and dignity.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Running away or dying is simply not a very practical option and
tends only to compound the existing troubles. Facing the trial with whining and
complaining, which has been my option of choice for most of my life, is hardly
better.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It drains me of energy and
becomes a burden to the people in my life. More significantly though, wasting
my energy on whining and complaining blinds me to all the good things that are
happening in life around me even in the midst of the troubles.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Finally I can choose to face these trials
with grace and dignity. Its sounds lovely doesn’t it?<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>But how do I do that? The answer I have come to is Faith.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In those times that cause the greatest
distress, I must dig down deep inside me and remember who I am and to whom I
belong.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Knowing that an all loving,
all-powerful God has everything in control affords me the option to rest
peacefully while the storm rages around me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>It brings to mind the story of Jesus and his disciple as they were
sailing to the far side of the sea. A great storm raged that threatened to
overturn the ship and kill everyone, and yet Jesus slept peacefully through
it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Jesus did nothing while on earth in
his own power, but relied entirely on his Father and his Holy Spirit.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He did not fear the storm because he had
complete assurance that he was in the hands of a great God with great
plans.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And so, through the troubles in
life, I can find peace when I have faith and completely trust in God who is my
guide through it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Faith in God is something I have been learning over the past 18 years,
not just the last 6 months.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>What is
significant about the refresher course in this is how it has impacted my
training in Kung Fu.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Kung Fu is
designed to better help you manage life. Ironically in my case, life seems to
be helping me to better manage my training in Kung Fu.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Kung Fu is like a mini exercise in life. In
a very controlled setting, with very specific goals, you willingly submit
yourself to a series of seemingly impossible tasks in which failure is a more
common experience than success.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>You are
told to do things you know full well you cannot do. Humiliation becomes a
constant companion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>You are faced with
tasks that repeatedly force you to make the choice…. Do I quit? Run away?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Whine and complain? Or do I face this with
dignity and grace?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Many people quit or
run away.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Whining and complaining is
something I have become quite proficient in. But facing it with dignity and
grace?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Like in life, that requires
faith.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Eventually, it is a faith in
myself:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>An assurance that I can dig
deep down inside and find within what is necessary to accomplish the task at
hand.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>But all faith takes time to grow.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>For the novice, there is only faith in the
Sifu and in the tradition of knowledge that has been passed down to him through
the Master and his disciples.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Eventually, as a student, I will come to a place, perhaps many times,
when I will want to run, or quit or whine about how impossible it all seems.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It is in those times when I must lean on faith;
faith in the Sifu’s promises that it is all worth it. I must trust that the
Sifu can see beyond the current failures and see the success just around the
corner. Faith that what he is asking me to do is <i>not</i> impossible, in
spite of how it looks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Trusting that he
can see in me abilities that I cannot yet see.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>And with each step of faith in the Sifu, slowly I begin to build faith
in myself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I come to know, with
assurance, that I <i>CAN</i> do something that seemed impossible. And, when
faced with each subsequent impossibility, I am tempted less and less to quit or
run or whine. Instead I can face them with grace and dignity.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>I can only assume that eventually
in the Kung Fu training process the student must make the transition to relying
more on his faith in himself than on his teacher.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Perhaps it is like walking with God. As you grow and mature, you
must learn to hear God yourself, to learn from life and no longer rely on the
teaching of others.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span></p>
