<B>The Book of Ezekiel</B> 
<P>
<B>I. Title</B> 
<P>
The title of the book is the same in Hebrew as it is in English
or Greek translations. The name Ezekiel means &quot;God is strong&quot;
or &quot;God strengthens&quot;.

<P>
The book of Ezekiel is a long series of oracles received by the
priest Ezekiel, son of Buzi, who began to prophesy in Babylonia
in the fifth year of Jehoiachin's exile, c. 593 BC. He was therefore
born around 622 BC, and had been taken captive to Babylon with
Jehoiachin in 597 BC (cf. 2 Kings 24).
<P>
He was married, but his wife died the day the siege against Jerusalem
began, about 588 BC.

<P>
The entire book is dated according to the reign of Jehoiachin,
and covers the years from about 593 through 570 BC. The first
deportation of captives to Babylon from Judah occurred about 605
BC, leaving Jehoiachin as king in Jerusalem. This is when Daniel
was taken captive. The second deportation occurred about 597 BC,
which is when Ezekiel found himself taken away. Jerusalem and
the temple were pillaged, but not destroyed. Nebuchadnezzar took
Jehoiachin away as captive, and left Zedekiah as king. In 586,
Nebuchadnezzar sacked and destroyed both Jerusalem and the temple.
For further background, read 2 Kings 23:36-25:30 and 2 Chronicles
36:5-21. Jeremiah and Daniel were both contemporaries of Ezekiel.
