<b>5. New Testament Apocalyptic</b>
<P>
 <blockquote>a. Mark 13 (and Parallels)</blockquote>
<P>
<b>ASSIGNMENT:</b> Read Mark 13 in your Bible, as well as Matthew 24-25.
<P>
 The New Testament writers seem to have held the same apocalyptic
world view as their Qumran contemporaries.  The central passage
of the New Testament which demonstrates this apocalyptic world
view is Mark 13.  All later New Testament apocalyptic passages
(including Revelation) draw on the imagery that is found in this
chapter.  And this chapter has drawn its imagery from the Old
Testament and intertestamental literature.  We shall now turn
to an examination of Mark 13.  The text of the passage will be
in bold print while my interspersed comments will be found in
regular print.
<P>
<blockquote>Mark 13
<P>
<B>As he came out of the temple, one of his disciples said to
him, &quot;Look, Teacher, what large stones and what large buildings!&quot;
2 Then Jesus asked him, &quot;Do you see these great buildings?
Not one stone will be left here upon another; all will be thrown
down.&quot;  3 When he was sitting on the Mount of Olives opposite
the temple, Peter, James, John, and Andrew asked him privately,
4 &quot;Tell us, when will this be, and what will be the sign
that all these things are about to be accomplished?&quot; 5 Then
Jesus began to say to them, &quot;Beware that no one leads you
astray.</B></blockquote>
<P>
As in other apocalypses, the question is posed about the end of
history and an answer is given by the heavenly guide.  Usually,
the guide is an angel, but here it is Jesus himself.  This is
unique and apparently signifies that for Mark, Jesus is the heavenly
guide supreme.
<P>
<blockquote><B> 6 Many will come in my name and say, 'I am he!'  and they
will lead many astray. 7 When you hear of wars and rumors of wars,
do not be alarmed; this must take place, but the end is still
to come. 8 For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against
kingdom; there will be earthquakes in various places; there will
be famines. This is but th   e beginning of the birlain</B></blockquote>
<P>
<B>The imagery of the new age as a new birth is also a typical
apocalyptic motif.</B>
<P>
<blockquote><B> 9 &quot;As for yourselves, beware; for they will hand you
over to councils; and you will be beaten in synagogues; and you
will stand before governors and kings because of me, as a testimony
to them. 10 And the good news must first be proclaimed to all
nations. 11 When they bring you to trial and hand you over, do
not worry beforehand about what you are to say; but say whatever
is given you at that time, for it is not you who speak, but the
Holy Spirit. 12 Brother will betray brother to death, and a father
his child, and children will rise against parents and have them
put to death; 13 and you will be hated by all because of my name.
But the one who endures to the end will be saved. </B></blockquote>
<P>
These verses seem to me to be a later interpolation into the text.
 It interrupts the flow of thought and could quite easily be left
out.  Its purpose is not apocalyptic but practical and therefore
is most likely secondary to the original context.
<P>
<blockquote><B>14 &quot;But when you see the desolating sacrilege set up where
it ought not to be (let the reader understand), then those in
Judea must flee to the mountains; 15 the one on the housetop must
not go down or enter the house to take anything away; 16 the one
in the field must not turn back to get a coat. 17 Woe to those
who are pregnant and to those who are nursing infants in those
days! 18 Pray that it may not be i   n winter.  For in those days
there will be suffering, such as has not been from the beginning
of the creation that God created until now, no, and never will
be. 20 And if the Lord had not cut short those days, no one would
be saved; but for the sake of the elect, whom he chose, he has
cut short those days.</B></blockquote>
<P>
Here is another typically apocalyptic segment, for it declares
that the righteous need fear nothing in regards to the end of
time.  Comfort, then, is the overriding concern of this and every
apocalyptic work.
<P>
<blockquote><B> 21 And if anyone says to you at that time, 'Look! Here is
the Messiah!' or 'Look! There he is!' -- do not believe it. 22 False
messiahs and false prophets will appear and produce signs and
omens, to lead astray, if possible, the elect. But be alert; I have already told you everything.</B></blockquote>
<P>
The apocalypticist here interpolates another secondary saying.
 The purpose of this segment is to serve as a warning to those
who are prone to believe in every Messianic claim.
<P>
<blockquote><B>24 &quot;But in those days, after that suffering,</B>
<P>
<B>the sun will be darkened,</B>
<br>
<B>and the moon will not give its light,</B>
<br>
<B>25 and the stars will be falling from heaven,</B>
<br>
<B>and the powers in the heavens will be shaken.</B><blockquote>
<P>
The reader will recognize this apocalyptic imagery from Daniel
and other apocalypses.  It serves to declare the cosmic dimensions
of the appearance of God and is modeled on the Old Testament theophany
texts.
<P>
<blockquote><B>26 Then they will see 'the Son of Man coming in clouds' with
great power and glory. 
<P>
Then he will send out the angels, and gather his elect
from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of
heaven. 28 &quot;From the fig tree learn its lesson: as soon as
its branch becomes tender and puts forth its leaves, you know
that summer is near. 29 So also, when you see these things taking
place, you know that he is near, at the very gates. 30 Truly I
tell you, this generation will not pass away until all these things
have taken place. 31 Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words
will not pass away. 32 &quot;But about that day or hour no one
knows, neither the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the
Father. 33 Beware, keep alert; for you do not know when the time
will come. 34 It is like a man going on a journey, when he leaves
home and puts his slaves in charge, each with his work, and commands
the doorkeeper to be on the watch. 35 Therefore, keep awake-for
you do not know when the master of the house will come, in the
evening, or at midnight, or at cockcrow, or at dawn, 36 or else
he may find you asleep when he comes suddenly. 37 And what I say
to you I say to all: Keep awake.&quot; </B></blockquote>
<P>
The last two words again encourage the community to remain faithful
in spite of their difficult circumstances.

<P>
<blockquote>b. 2 Thessalonians</blockquote>
<P>
 The second letter to Thessalonica was written by a student /
disciple of Paul at the end of the first century.  It has one
passage in particular which is apocalyptic in nature.  It is this
passage which will be the object of our attention in this brief
segment.
<P>
<blockquote>2 Thess 2
<P>
<B>As to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered
together to him, we beg you, brothers and sisters,  2 not to be
quickly shaken in mind or alarmed, either by spirit or by word
or by letter, as though from us, to the effect that the day of
the Lord is already here. 3 Let no one deceive you in any way;
for that day will not come unless the rebellion comes first and
the lawless one  is revealed, the one destined for destruction.
 4 He opposes and exalts himself above every so-called god or
object of worship, so that he takes his seat in the temple of
God, declaring himself to be God. 5 Do you not remember that I
told you these things when I was still with you? 6 And you know
what is now restraining him, so that he may be revealed when his
time comes. 7 For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work,
but only until the one who now restrains it is removed. 8 And
then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will
destroy  with the breath of his mouth, annihilating him by the
manifestation of his coming. 9 The coming of the lawless one is
apparent in the working of Satan, who uses all power, signs, lying
wonders, 10 and every kind of wicked deception for those who are
perishing, because they refused to love the truth and so be saved.
11 For this reason God sends them a powerful delusion, leading
them to believe what is    false, 16 so that all who have not
believed the truth but took pleasure in unrighteousness will be
condemned.</B></blockquote>
<P>
As in the other apocalypses we have examined, this one
too demonstrates an interest in the &quot;end times&quot; and
offers words of comfort to those who experience difficulties.
 What is interesting here is that the author has clearly described
certain &quot;end time&quot; events in connection with the enemy
of God.  This, too, is typical of Apocalyptic- but after Mark
13 it is unusual for a New Testament apocalypse.  We will see
this kind of description ONLY in the book of Revelation.
<P>
 Our task continues with a rather thorough description and exposition
of the book of Revelation, the best known apocalypse and the most
complete New Testament document to offer words of hope in a historically
hopeless situation.
