Quartz Hill School of Theology is an academic institution designed
to train believers for more effective ministry, both in and out
of the church. QHST affirms that each believer is a priest before
God, indwelt by the Holy Spirit, not needing any human intermediary
to reach God and competent to judge spiritual matters for him
or herself.
<P>
Quartz Hill School of Theology is a ministry of Quartz Hill Community Church,
which is associated with the Southern Baptist Convention.
<P>
Quartz Hill School of Theology admits students regardless of race,
religion, gender, age, national origin or handicap.
