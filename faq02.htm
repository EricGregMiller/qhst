<P>
In Genesis 5:4 we are told that after Seth was born, Adam had
other sons

and daughters.  The assumption, therefore, is that Cain married
one of

his relatives, either a sister, cousin, or niece.  Although this
seems

odd, who else would there have been for him to marry?
<P>
We have an example in the Bible of someone else being married
to his

half-sister: Abraham.  (see Gen. 20:9-13)
