<CENTER><B><H1>The Religion of the Canaanites</H1></B></CENTER>
<P>
 Was the command to exterminate the Canaanites a justifiable act
on the part of God, who ordered it, or on the part of people,
who partially, at least, obeyed it?  Was the episode at variance
with the character of God and his people?  That it was inconsistent
and unjustified both on God's side and humanity's has been so
often asserted, that a consideration of the moral and religious
character of the Canaanites is a question of utmost importance
in solving the supposed theological difficulties that are commonly
adduced.
<P>
 Professor H.H. Rowley, for example, claims that the divine command
to destroy the Canaanites in general, or Jericho and its inhabitants
in kparticular, and similar episodes in the Old Testament are
contrary to the New Testament revelation of God in Christ, and
involve the erroneous thoughts of the writers or characters in
question about God, which we can now no longer accept as true.
 Moreover, Rowley claims that such incidents of wholesale destruction
contain that which is &quot;spiritually unsatisfying&quot; and
involve &quot;dishonoring God.&quot;
<P>
 So, this divine command to exterminate from the face of the earth
all men, women, and children belonging to the seven or eight nations
of Canaan is one of the most frequently raised objections to seeing
God as just and loving in the Old Testament.  How can God's fairness
and mercy be seen in such blanket and wholesale condemnation of
entire nations?
<P>
 All attempts to mitigate or tone down this command to totally
wipe out the population are ruined on the clear instructions of
texts like Exodus 23:32-33, 34:12-16, Deuteronomy 7:1-5, and 20:15-18.
 The presence of the term <I>herem</I> in the sense of &quot;forced
destruction&quot; constantly was applied to the Canaanites and
thus they are marked for extermination.
<P>
 Once again we are back to the question, &quot;Will not the judge
of all the earth do right?&quot;  It is the question Abraham asked
of God, just before He destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.  It would
seem clear that the OT does uphold the justice and righteousness
of God, even in this command to eradicate the Canaanites. (Of
course, consider the question Job's friend asked in Job 8:3: &quot;Does
God pervert justice?  Does the Almighty pervert what is right?&quot;
 Job's reply, in Job 9, is, in essence &quot;yes&quot;.)
<P>
 To place the whole question in perspective, let the principle
of Deuteronomy 9:5 be cited:
<P>
 It is not because of your righteousness or your integrity that
you are going in to take possession of their land; but onl account
of the wickedness of these nations, the Lord your God will drive
them out before you, to accomplish what he swore to your fathers,
to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
<P>
 Therefore, there is no attempt to establish a tacit or real moral
superiority for Israel; the text informs us to the contrary in
its explicit statements and narratives.  The call of Yahweh cannot
be traced to Israel's superiority in righteousness or numbers,
&quot;but it was because the Lord loved you and kept the oath
which he swore to your forefathers.&quot; (Deut. 7:6-8).
<P>
 Ronald Goetz, with some justification, wonders why it is, then,
that &quot;...Israel is helped in spite of her sins, while the
Canaanites are destroyed because of theirs?&quot;  The answer
does not like, as Goetz himself observes in the fact that Israel
is vastly more righteous than the Canaanites, for that is indeed
a semi-Pelagian Pharisaism (Pelagianism: a fifth century Christian
heresy taught by Pelagius and his followers that stressed the
essential goodness of human nature and the freedom of the human
will.  Pelagius was concenred about the slack moral standard among
Christians, and he hoped to improve their conduct by his teachings.
 Rejecting the arguments of those who claimed that they sinned
because of human weakness, he insisted that God made human beings
free to choose between good and evil and that sin was voluntary.
 Celestius, a disciple of Pelagius, denied the church's doctrine
of original sin.  Pelagianism was opposed by Augustine, bishop
of Hippo, who asserted that human beings could not attain righteousness
by their own efforts and were totally dependent upon the grace
of God.  Condemned by two councils of African bishops in 416,
and again at Carthage in 418, Pelagius and Celestius were finally
excommunicated in 418; Pelagius' later fate is unknown [perhaps
he changed his name to Robert Schuler]).  The answer does not
lie in the righteousness of Israel, but it does lie in the increasing
degrees of guilt that Canaan accrued.  Even Jesus appealed to
this principle in dealing with a comparison of cities in his day
as judged over against Sodom and Gomorrah (Mat. 10:15).  There
had been a patient waiting from Abraham's time &quot;for the sin
of the Amorite...[to reach] its full measure.&quot; (Gen. 15:16)
<P>
 This is not to say that Israel was permitted or even ordered
to treat all other nations the same way, for Deuteronomy 20:10-15
odrders them to offer conditions of peace rather than extermination
to all otehrs.  However, the verses that follow, namely 16-18,
disallowed the same offer to be given to Canaan.  In fact, the
Hebrew wars with other nations (except Canaan) were designed to
be only in self-defense.
<P>
 Why then were the Canaanites singled out for such severe treatment?
 They were cut off to prevent Israel and the rest of the world
from being corrupted (Deut. 20:16-18).  When a people starts to
burn their children in honor of their gods (Lev. 18:21), practice
sodomy, bestiality, and all sorts of loathsome vice (Lev. 18:23,
24, 20:3), the land itself begins to &quot;vomit&quot; them out
as the body heaves under the load of internal poisons (Lev. 18:25,
27-30).  Thus, &quot;objection to the fate of these nations ...
is really an objection to the highest manifestation of the grace
of God.&quot;  Green likens this action on God's part, not to
doing evil that good may come (though that does seem often to
be God's methodology: the ends justify the means), but doing good
in spite of certain evil consequences, just as a surgeon does
not refrain from amputating a gangrenous leg even though in so
doing he cannot help cutting off much healthy flesh.
<P>
 But there is more.  Green observes that &quot;...We may object
to God's doing immediately and personally what we do not object
to his doing mediately, through providence.  Now nothing is more
certain than that providence is administered on the principle
that individuals share in the life of the family and of the nation
to which they belong; and that, consequently it is right that
they should participate in its punishments as in its rewards....Though
many innocent persons could not but suffer, it was right, because
of the relation in which they stood to the guilty, that this should
be so.&quot;
<P>
 One more observation must be made here.  Every forcast or prophesy
of doom, like any prophetic word about the future except those
few promises connected with the Noahic, Abrahamic, Davidic and
New Covenants (which are unconditional and dependant solely on
God's work of fulfillment), had a suppressed &quot;unless&quot;
attached to them.  At that moment that nation turns from its evil
way and repents then at that time the Lord would relent and cease
to bring the threatened harm (cf. Jer. 18:7-10).  Thus Canaan
had, as it were, a final forty-year countdown as they heard of
the events in Egypt, at the crossing of the Reed Sea, and what
happened to the kings who opposed Israel along the way.  We know
that they were aware of such events, for Rahab confessed that
these same events had terrorized her city of Jericho and that
she, as a result, had placed her faith in the God of the Hebrews
(Josh. 2:10-14).  Thus God waited for the &quot;cup of iniquity&quot;
to fill up -- and fill up it did without any change in spite of
the marvelous signs given so that the nations, along with Pharaoh
and the Egyptians, &quot;might know that he was the Lord.&quot;
<P>
 The destruction of the Canaanites was on the same principle as
the whole world was judged (except for eight persons) in the Deluge
or the five cities of the plain (including Sodom and Gomorrah),
or Pharaoh's army.  Usually those who object to these events are
those who deny any compatibility of the doctrine of eternal punishment
of the wicked with the mercy and love of God.
<P>
 God's character and the acts he requires are fully consistent
with everything that both testaments would lead us to expect in
our God.  The problem usually centers in a deficiency in our view
of things and our ability to properly define terms or grasp the
whole of a subject.
<P>
<I><B>Canaanite Morality (an oxymoron)</B></I>
<P>
 Despite the paramount import of Canaanite morality and religion
in the realm of theology and general Biblical studies, little
was known about the subject 70 years ago except taht which, on
the one hand, could be gleaned from the Bible, which, however,
was ample enough for faith and on the other hand, that which was
preserved in the Graeco-Roman authors, which was meager enough
from the scholar's viewpoint.
<P>
<B> Philo of Byblos</B>
<P>
 The main source of knowledge about Canaanite religion before
the new sources became available after 1930 (primarily the Ugaritic
materials) was Philo of Byblos, the Greek name of ancient Gebal
on the Mediterranean (Josh. 13:5, 1 Kings 5:18), forty-two miles
north of Sidon.  Philo lived around 100 AD.  He was a native Phoenician
scholar and gathered data for a historical work called Phoenikika
or &quot;Phoenician Matters&quot;, designated &quot;Phoenician
History&quot; by later Greek scholars.  According to Porphery
and Eusebius, Philo translated the writings of an earlie Phoenician
named Sanchuniathon, who was supposed  to have lived at a very
remote age, whom W. F. Albright placed between 700 and 500 BC.
 Sanchuniathon in turn supposedly got his material from one Hierombalus
under Abibal, king of Berytus, who is said to have flourished
before the Trojan War.
<P>
<B> Ugaritic Poetry</B>
<P>
 The abstract of Phoenician mythology which has been preserved
from Philo through Eusebius (like biblical notices on the same
subject) used to be commonly regarded with suspician by critical
scholarship and considered as mostly an invention by Philo, without
any independent value as a source of knowledge of Phoenician religion.
 This skeptical attitude as disappered as a consequence of the
recovery of religious epic literature of Ugarit on the north Syrian
coast (1927-1937).
<P>
 These significant poetical texts discovered by D.F.A. Schaefer
in a series of campaigns have shown that the gods of Philo bear
names in large part now well-known from Ugarit as well as from
other sources.  The Philo myths are characterized by the same
moral abandon and primitive barbarity with fondness for descriptive
names and personifications that are found at Ugarit.
<P>
 The new sources of knowledge indicate little change in the content
of Canaanite mythology between c. 1400 BC and 700 BC.  Many details
of Philo's account, not only in the matter of the names of deities,
but in the mythological atmosphere as well are in complete agreement
with the Ugaritic myths and late Phoenician inscriptions.  Scholars
are, therefore, justified in accepting, at least provisionally,
all data preserved by Philo that do not involve subjective interpretation
on his part.
<P>
<B> The Canaanite Pantheon</B>
<P>
 As the myths of ancient Ugarit indicate, the religion of the
Canaanite peoples was a crude and debased form of ritual polytheism.
 It was associated with sensuous fertility-cult worship of a particularly
lewd and orgiastic kind, which proved to be more influential than
any other nature religion in the ANE.
<P>
 Canaanite deities, on the one hand, present remarkable fluidity
of personality and function, so that it is often extremely difficult
to fix the particular domain of different gods or to define their
kinship to one another.  Physical relationship, and even sex,
change with disconcerting ease.  This is one of the grossly irrational
aspects of Canaanite religion, indicative of its corrupt nature.
 On the other hand, Canaanite deities have for the most part etymologically
transparent names, a fact which seems to point to the Canaanite
pantheon as representing a cruder and more primitive type of polytheism.
<P>
 Miscellaneous epigraphic and literary sources reveal the names
of the chief gods and goddesses of numerous Canaanite citaies
in various periods.  The Ugaritic deities are now best known because
of the hundreds of religious texts dating from the fifteenth and
early fourteenth century BC which were found in a library housed
in a building situated between Ugarit's two great temples, one
dedicated to Baal and the other to Dagon.  The divinities which
figure in the mythological texts from Ugarit were evidently not
peculiar to the city, but were current among all Canaanites, since
they brear only a vague relationship to the most popular deities
worshipped in the city itself.
<P>
<B> El</B>
<P>
 El is the name by which the supreme Canaanite deity is known.
 This is also a name by which God is called in the Old Testament
-- El, the God (Elohim) of Israel (<I>el elohe yisrael: </I>Gen.
33:20).  In most prose it occures more often with an adjunct:
<I>El Elyon</I> (the most high God, Gen. 14:18), <I>El Shaddai</I>
(traditionally, God Almighty, Gen. 17:1), <I>El Hai</I> (The living
God, Josh. 3:10), and very commonly in the plural of majesty,
Elohim.  In Hebrew poetry <I>El</I> is much more frequent, where
it stands quite often without any adjunct (Ps. 18:31, 33, 48;
68:21; Job 8:3).
<P>
 The word <I>El</I> is a generic name for &quot;god&quot; in Northwest
Semitic (Hebrew and Ugaritic) and as such it is also used in the
Old Testament for heathen deities or idols (Ex. 34:14; Ps. 81:10;
Is. 44:10).  The original generic term was <I>'ilum</I>; dropping
the mimation and the nominative  case ending (<I>u</I>) becomes
<I>'el</I> in Hebrew.  It was almost certainly an adjectival formation
(intransitive participle) from the root &quot;to be strong, powerful&quot;
(<I>'wl</I>), meaning &quot;The Strong (or Powerful) One.&quot;
<P>
 In Canaanite paganism the <I>el</I>, <I>par excelence,</I> was
the head of the panthon.  As the god, El was, in accordance with
the general irrationality and moral grossness of Canaanite religion,
a dim and shadowy figure, who, Philo says, had three wives, who
were also his sisters, and who could readily step down from his
eminence and become the hero of sordid escapades and crimes. 
Philo portrays El as a bloody tyrant, whose acts terrified all
the other gods, and who dethroned his own father, murdered his
favorite son, and decapitated his own daughter.  The Ugaritic
poems add the crime of uncontrolled lust to his morbid character
and the description of his seduction of two unnamed women is the
most sensuous in ANE literature (much of Ugaritic literature is
R rated at best).
<P>
 Despite all this, El was considered the exalted &quot;father
of years&quot; (<I>abu shanima</I>), the &quot;father of man&quot;
(<I>abu adami</I>), and &quot;father bull&quot;, that is, the
progenitor of the gods, tacitly likened to a bull in the midst
of a herd of cows. Like Homer's Zeus, he was &quot;the father
of men and gods.&quot;
<P>
<B>Baal</B>
<P>
 Baal was the son of El, and the reigning king of the gods, dominating
the Canaanite pantheon.  As El's successor he was enthroned on
a lofty mountain the the far northern heavens.  Often he was considered
to be &quot;the Lord of Heaven&quot; (<I>Baal-shamem</I>); but
sometimes distinguished from the latter, as in Philo, Baal was
the god of the rain and storm, whose voice could be heard reverberating
through the heavens in the thunder.  He is pictured on a Ras Shamra
stela brandishing a mace in his right hand and holding in his
left hand a stylized thunderbolt ending in a spear head.
<P>
 In Ugaritic literature Baal is given the epithet Aliyan, &quot;the
one who prevails&quot;.  As the giver of rain and all fertility,
he figures prominently in Canaanite mythology in his struggle
with Mot (Death), the god of drought and adversity.  In his grapple
with Mot, he is slain.  As a consequence, a seven year cycle of
scarcity ensues.  Thereupon the goddess Anath, the sister and
lover of Baal Aliyan, goes in search of him, recovers his body
and slays his enemy, Mot.  Baal is then brought back to life and
placed on Mot's throne so that he ma insure the revival of vegetation
for seven years.  This is the central theme of the great Baal
Epic of Ugarit.
<P>
 Besides the king of the gods and the storm god, Baal was the
god of justice, the terror of evildoers.  He was also called &quot;the
son of Dagon&quot;, the grain god, who was athe cheif deity of
Ashdod (1 Sam. 5:1-7) and who had temples at Ugarit and Gaza (Judges
16:23).
<P>
 At Ugarit Baal's consort was his sister Anath, but at Samaria
in the ninth century BC Ashera appears in that role (1 Kings 18:19).
 Different places at different periods arranged the pantheon somewhat
differently, but the picture by and large was fairly stable. 
The name <I>ba'al</I> itself in Northwest Semitic (Hebrew, Phoenician
and Ugaritic) is the common noun for &quot;master&quot; or &quot;lord&quot;
and accordingly, like <I>'el</I>, &quot;strong one&quot;, could
be applied to various gods.  Actually, however, from an early
period (by at least the 15th century BC) the ancient Semitic storm-god
Hadad (Akkadian <I>Adad</I>) became &quot;the lord&quot; <I>par
excellence</I>.
<P>
<B>Anath</B>
<P>
 A combination of the sister and spouse of Baal, was one of a
galaxy of three Canaanite goddesses whose character gives a hint
of the depths of the moral depravity to which the Canaanite cults
sank.  The other two are Astarte and Asherah.  All three were
patronesses of sex and war -- sex mainly in its sensuous aspect
as lust, and war in its aspects of violence and murder.  The depraved
character of Canaanite religion is indicated by the character
of Anath.  An Egyptian text of the New Kingdom period described
Anath and Astarte as &quot;the great goddesses who conceive but
do not bear.&quot;
<P>
 Another equally viscious characteristic of Anath worship was
the fiendish savagery of the composite goddess.  A fragment of
the Baal Epic (II.7ff) shows her indulging in a massacre of old
and young alike:
<P>
She smites the people of the seashore
<P>
Destroys mankind of the sunrise....
<P>
She piles up heads on her back
<P>
She ties up hands in her bundle....
<P>
Anath gluts her liver with laughter
<P>
Her heart is filled with joy.
<P>
 Egyptian texts represented Astarte and Anath as goddesses of
violence and war, showing them naked astride a galloping horse,
waving weapons of battle.
<P>
 Interestingly enough, Anath was given the epithet of &quot;virgin&quot;
and &quot;the Holy One&quot; (<I>qudshu</I>) in her invariable
role of a sacred prostitute.  This term <I>qudshu</I>, &quot;the
Holy One&quot; is related to the biblical term translated &quot;holy&quot;.
 It is important to recognize that among Semitic poeples the idea
of &quot;holiness&quot; was applied to <I>anything</I> that had
been dedicated to the service of a deity.  The moral connotation
of the term is a later, derived, concept.  Even in the OT, its
usage is often just in the sense of &quot;separated&quot; to God.
<P>
 Anath is represented often as a naked woman bestride a lion with
a lilly in one hand and a serpant in the other.  The lilly represented
sex appeal and the serpant represented fertility.
<P>
 The male prositutes consecrated to her honor were called <I>qadesh</I>
(Deut. 23:18, 1 Kings 14:24, 15:12, 22:46).  The feminine <I>qedesha</I>
is also found (Deut. 23:18, Hosea 4:14)
<P>
<B>Astarte</B>
<P>
 The goddess of the evening star, was like Anath and Ashera concerned
with sex and war and was not always clearly distinguished from
them.  In Egypt Anath and Astarte were even fused into one deity
called Antart, while in later Syria their cult was displaced by
that of a composite deity: Anat-Ashtart (Atargatis).  Like Anath,
Astarte was both a mother goddess and a divine courtesan, and
she shares all the latter's moral turpitude.  (She was also known
as Ishtar in Persia, and the name Esther is a form of this word.
 Additionally, the English word &quot;star&quot; comes from this
name).
<P>
<B>Asherah</B>
<P>
 She was the wife of El in Ugaritic mythology, and is the goddess
who is also called Athirau-Yammi: &quot;She Who Walks on (or in)
 the Sea&quot;.  She was the cheif goddess of Tyre in the 15th
century BC, and bore the appellation <I>qudshu</I>, &quot;holiness.&quot;
 In the OT Asherah appears as a goddess by the side of Baal, whose
consort she evidently became, at least among the Canaanites of
the south.  However, most biblical references to the name point
obviously to some cult object of wood, which might be cut down
and burned, possibly the goddesses' image (1 Kings 15:13, 2 King
21:7).  Her prophets are mentioned (1 Kings 18:19), and the vessels
used in her service referred to (2 Kings 23:4).  The existence
of numerous symbols, in each of which the goddess was believed
to be immanent, led to the creation of numerous forms of her person,
which were described as Asherim.  The cult object itself, whatever
it was, was utterly detestible to faithful worshippers of Yahweh
(1 Kings 15:13), and was set up on the high places beside the
&quot;alters of incense&quot; (hammanim) and the &quot;stone pillars&quot;
(<I>masseboth</I>).  The translation of <I>asherah</I> by &quot;grove&quot;
in some translations follows a singular tradition preserved in
the LXX and the Vulgate which apparently connects the goddess'
image with the usual place of its adoration.
<P>
<B>Mot</B>
<P>
 Mot means &quot;death&quot;, and he was Baal's enemy.  He is
the god of the dead and all the powers that opposed life and fertility.
 He was the favorite son of El, and the most prominent enemy of
the god Baal.  Mot was the god of sterility and the master of
all barren places.  Traditionally Mot and Baal were perpetually
engaged in a seasonal struggle in which Baal, like many similar
harvest deities, was annually vanquished and slain.  Mot, however,
was annually vanquished and killed by Baal's sister and lover
Anath, who thus aided Baal's resurrection.
<P>
<B>Reshep</B>
<P>
 Or Resheph (from Hebrew <I>reshef</I>, &quot;the burner&quot;,
or &quot;the ravager&quot;), an ancient West Semitic god of the
plague and of the underworld, the companion of Anath, and the
equivalent of the Bablylonian god Nergal.  He was also a war god
and was thus represented as a bearded man, brandishing an ax,
holding a shield, and waring a tall, pointed headdress with a
goat's or gazelle's head on his forehead.  Resheph was worshipped
especially at Ras Shamra (Ugarit), Byblos, and Arsuf (later Apollonia,
near Yafo); under the title Mikal (or Mekal) he was also worshipped
at Beth-shean in eastern Palestine and at Ialium in Cyprus. Resheph
was usually believed to be related to Mot, the god of sterility
and death, but he also seems to have been a god of well-being,
plenty, and fertility, and in that respect he may have been a
form of the god Baal.
<P>
<B>Shulman (or Shalim)</B>
<P>
 The god of health.  The name is related to the Hebrew word <I>shalom</I>,
which means &quot;peace&quot; or &quot;prosperity&quot;.
<P>
<B>Koshar (Hothar)</B>
<P>
 The god of arts and crafts.  He seems to be related to the Hebrew
<I>kosher</I>, which means &quot;fit&quot; or &quot;proper&quot;.
<P>
<I><B>The General Character of Canaanite Cults</B></I>
<P>
 The Ugaritic literature has helped reveal the depth of depravity
which characterized Canaanite religion.  Being a polytheism of
an extremely debased type, Canaanite cultic practice was barbarous
and thoroughly licentious.  It inevitably had a most serious retarding
and debilitating effect on every phase of Canaanite cultural and
community life.  It was inescapable that people should gravitate
to the moral level of the sordid gods they worshipped, or rather
that the gods were a reflection of their society.  &quot;Like
gods, like priest; like prist, like people&quot; expresses a law
that operates unfailingly.
<P>
<B> Canaanite Cults Utterly Immoral</B>
<P>
 The brutality, lust and abandon of Canaanite mythology is far
worse than elsewhere in the ANE at this time.  And the astounding
characteristic of Canaanite deities, that the had no moral character
whatsoever, must have brought out the worst traits in their devotees
and entailed many of the most demoralizing practices of the time,
such as sacred prostitution, child sacrifice and snake worship.
<P>
<B> Canaanite Cults Effete and Corrupt</B>
<P>
 Such an effete and corrupt religion could have no other than
a devitalizing effect on the population.  So vile had the practices
of the Canaanites become that the land was said to &quot;vomit
out its inhabitants&quot; (Lev. 18:25) and the Israelites were
warned by Yahweh to keep all his statutes and ordinances &quot;that
the land,&quot; into which he was about to bring them, would not
&quot;vomit&quot; them out (Lev. 20:22).  The character of the
Canaanite religion as portrayed I the Ugaritic literature furnishes
ample background to illustrate the accuracy of these biblical
statements in their characterization of the utter moral and religious
degeneracy of the inhabitants of Canaan, wo were accordingly to
be decimated and dispossessed.  
<P>
<B> The Character of the Canaanite Cults Justifies the Command
to Destroy Them</B>
<P>
 It is without sound theological basis to question God's justice
in ordering the extermination of such a depraved people or to
deny Israel's integrity as God's people in carrying out the divine
order.  Nor is there anything in this episode or the devotion
of Jericho to destruction that involves conflict with the New
Testament revelation of God in Jesus Christ.
<P>
 God's infinite holiness is just as much outraged by sin in the
NT as it was in the OT, and the divine wrath is not less in the
NT against those who refuse the forgiveness provided by Christ.
 Consider what Jesus said to and about the scribes and Pharisees
who opposed him, the fate of Annanias and Sephira, or the rather
apocalyptic judgments describe in Revelation.
<P>
 The principle of divine forbearance, however, operates in every
era of God's dealings with people.  God awaits till the measure
of iniquity is full, whether in the case of the Amorite (Gen.
15:16) or the antediluvians consumed by the Deluge (Gen. 6) or
the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah (Gen. 19).  But God always
gives a way to repent and avoid the judgment (consider God's words
in Ezekiel 33, as an example -- &quot;God takes no pleasure in
the death of the wicked, but rather, that the wicked turn from
his evil ways.&quot;)

 In the case of the Canaanites, instead of using the forces of
nature to effect his punitive endes, he employs the Israelites
to be his ministers of justice.  The Israelites were apprized
of the truth that theywere the instruments of the divine judgement
(Joshua 5:13-14).  In the light of the total picture the extermination
of the canaaites by the Israelites was just and employment of
the Israelites for the purpose was right.  It was, frankly, a
question of destroying or being destroyed, of keeping separated
or of being contaminated and consumed.

 Implicit in the righteous judgment was the divine intention to
protect and benefit the world.  When Joshua and the Israelites
entered Palestine in the 14th century (or 13th), Canaanite civilization
was so decadent that it was small loss to the world that in parts
of Palestine it was virtually exterminated.  The failure of the
Israelites to execute God's command fully was one of the great
blunders which theycommitted, as well as a sin, and it resulted
in lasting injury to the nation (Judges 1:28, 2:1-3).

 In the ensuing judgment the infinite holiness of Yahweh, the
God of Israel, was to be vindicated saliently against the dark
background of a thoroughly immoral and degraded paganism.  The
completely uncompromising attitude commanded by yahweh and followed
by the leaders of Israel must be seen in its true light.  Compromise
between Israel's God and the degraded deities of Canaanite religion
was unthinkable.  Yahweh and Baal were poles apart.  There could
be no compromise without catastrophe.

 It was fortunate for the future of monotheism that the Israelites
of the conquest were a wild folk, endowed with primitive energy
and ruthless will to exist, since the resulting decimation of
the Canaanites prevented the complete fusion of the two kindred
folk which would almost inevitably have depressed Yahwistic standards
to a point where recovery was impossible. Thus the Canaanites,
with their orgiastic nature-worship, their cult of fertility in
the form of serpent symbols and sensuous nudity, and their gross
mythology, were replaced by Israel, with its nomadic simplicity
and purity of life, its lofty monotheism, and its severe code
of ethics.  In a not altogether dissimilar way, a millennium later,
the African Canaaanites, as they still called themselves, or the
Carthaginians, as we call them, with the gross Phoenician mythology
which we know from Ugarit and Philo Byblius, with human sacrifices
and the cult of sex, were crushed by the immensely superior Romans,
whose stern code of morals and singularly elevated paganism remind
us in many ways of early Israel. (Note: the Romans were apparently
descended from Japheth, so their destruction of Carthage was a
fulfillment of Gen. 9:27).
