My fears are conquered, my pain has gone.<br>
Ancestral boundaries have been destroyed.<br>
Jesus, mighty one, my Lord and King has finished<br>
My deliverance.<P>
Every dark corner has been revealed.<br>
Jesus' glorious light shines all around<br>
Those who cowered in the powerless<br>
strongholds of the enemy have been removed in<br>
My deliverance<P>
To know you Father, for this I was made<br>
Now all Hell's minions (my inheritance) are banished,<br>
And I will sing and give highest praise to you for<br>
My deliverance.
