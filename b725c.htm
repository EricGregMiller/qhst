<B><I>Redaction Criticism</I></B><P>
<P>
 Redaction Criticism is the study of editorial activity.  A redactor
is simply an editor who shapes the material he has received for
a purpose.  Sometimes the purpose of the redactor is in harmony
with the author and sometimes it is not.
<P>
 In this segment of our study we will be examining the methods
used to discover editorial work and how it can be distinguished
from the authors own work.
<P>
 Performing redaction criticism is simply a matter of (again)
asking questions of the text.  The first question that must be
asked is, does the segment of text I am looking at show &quot;seams&quot;
or &quot;stitches&quot;.  Seams or stitches are obvious comments
in the text which interrupt the flow of the narrative.  These
are called &quot;commentary&quot; by literary critics.  (NB: It
must be noted that the various methods of criticism overlap in
places).
<P>
 If there is an obvious seam, then one must ask- does this seam
attempt to clarify the passage; or does it seem to take the passage
in another direction?  The following passage will illustrate these
questions.  The <B>BOLD</B> face type are those words deemed editorial
comments.  The normal face type is the original narrative.  The
student will note that the editorial comments serve either to
explain a word or phrase, or to make a theological comment which
explains the text.  The passage is John 3:1ff.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;Now there was a Pharisee named Nicodemus, a leader
of the Jews. He came to Jesus by night and said to him, &quot;Rabbi,
we know that you are a teacher who has come from God; for no one
can do these signs that you do apart from the presence of God.&quot;
 Jesus answered him, &quot;Very truly, I tell you, no one can
see the kingdom of God without being born from above.&quot;  Nicodemus
said to him, &quot;How can anyone be born after having grown old?
<B>Can one enter a second time into the mother's womb and be born?&quot;</B>
 Jesus answered, &quot;Very truly, I tell you, no one can enter
the kingdom of God without being born of water and Spirit.  <B>What
is born of the flesh is flesh, and what is born of the Spirit
is spirit</B>.  Do not be astonished that I said to you, 'You
must be born from above.'    <B>The wind blows where it chooses, and
you hear the sound of it, but you do not know where it comes from
or where it goes. So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit.
 </B>Nicodemus said to him, &quot;How can these things be?&quot;
 Jesus answered him, &quot;Are you a teacher of Israel, and yet
you do not understand these things?  &quot;Very truly, I tell
you, we speak of what we know and testify to what we have seen;
yet you do not receive our testimony.   If I have told you about
earthly things and you do not believe, how can you believe if
I tell you about heavenly things?  <B>No one has ascended into
heaven except the one who descended from heaven, the Son of Man.
 And </B>just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness,
so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that whoever believes in
him may have eternal life<B>.  &quot;For God so loved the world
that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him
may not perish but may have eternal life.   &quot;Indeed, God
did not send the Son into the world to condemn the world, but
in order that the world might be saved through him.  Those who
believe in him are not condemned; but those who do not believe
are condemned already, because they have not believed in the name
of the only Son of God.  And this is the judgment, that the light
has come into the world, and people loved darkness rather than
light because their deeds were evil.  For all who do evil hate
the light and do not come to the light, so that their deeds may
not be exposed.  But those who do what is true come to the light,
so that it may be clearly seen that their deeds have been done
in God.&quot;</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 The bold print can clearly be seen to interrupt the flow of the
narrative and the it frequently offers clarification or explanation.
 This is what redaction critics mean when they talk of edited text.
<P>
 The student can find these editorial insertions and clarifications
in most passages in the Bible.  The passage above is offered simply
because it is very well known.
<P>
 The purpose of these editorial insertions is to make explicit
what the editor saw as the underlying theological message.  The
editor thus saw himself as simply making plain what he may have
considered to be unclear.  Redaction criticism is a very subjective
method and the student should make sure that there is a clear
seam before assigning a passage to the editor.
<P>
 A very famous, and yet plainly clear example of editorial work
is found in the so called &quot;long ending&quot; of Mark.  The
oldest manuscripts of Mark do not contain Mark 16:9ff (see the
text criticism module).  The verses appended by a later editor
clearly attmempt to harmonize the ending of Mark with the endings
of Matthew and Luke.  Here, the editor wanted to make sure that
the &quot;Great Commission&quot; and the post resurrection appearences
were included in Mark.  He saw their absence as a possible source
of confusion- so he clarified by adding them in!
<P>
 Here is Mark 16.  Again, the BOLD face type are the editorial
insertions while the plain type is the original narrative of the
author:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;When the sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the
mother of James, and Salome bought spices, so that they might
go and anoint him.  And very early on the first day of the week,
when the sun had risen, they went to the tomb.  They had been
saying to one another, &quot;Who will roll away the stone for
us from the entrance to the tomb?&quot;   When they looked up,
they saw that the stone, <B>which was very large</B>, had already
been rolled back.  As they entered the tomb, they saw a young
man, dressed in a white robe, sitting on the right side; and they
were alarmed.  But he said to them, "Don't be alarmed.  You are looking for Jesus of Nazareth,
who was crucified. He has been raised; he is not here. Look, there
is the place they laid him. But go, tell his disciples and Peter
that he is going ahead of you to Galilee; there you will see him,
just as he told you.&quot;  So they went out and fled from the
tomb, for terror and amazement had seized them; and they said
nothing to anyone, for they were afraid<B>.  Now after he rose
early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary
Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons.  She went out
and told those who had been with him, while they were mourning
and weeping.  But when they heard that he was alive and had been
seen by her, they would not believe it.  After this he appeared
in another form to two of them, as they were walking into the
country.  And they went back and told the rest, but they did not
believe them. Later he appeared to the eleven themselves as they
were sitting at the table; and he upbraided them for their lack
of faith and stubbornness, because they had not believed those
who saw him after he had risen.  And he said to them, &quot;Go
into all the world and proclaim the good news to the whole creation.
 The one who believes and is baptized will be saved; but the one
who does not believe will be condemned.  And these signs will
accompany those who believe: by using my name they will cast out
demons; they will speak in new tongues; they will pick up snakes
in their hands, and if they drink any deadly thing, it will not
hurt them; they will lay their hands on the sick, and they will
recover.&quot;  So then the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to
them, was taken up into heaven and sat down at the right hand
of God.  And they went out and proclaimed the good news everywhere,
while the Lord worked with them and confirmed the message by the
signs that accompanied it.&quot;</B></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
 This editoritorial addition can be seen by anyone.  In the original narrative,
the women leave the tomb terrified and speak to no one.  In the
editorial addition the women speak to the disciples!  The student
should also note the harmonization with the other Gospels which
takes place in this editorial addition.
<P>
 When one is able to use the method of Redaction criticism, one
is able to separate the strands of the author and the editor.
 This is a very important task in the theological explication
of the Bible.
