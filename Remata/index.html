    <h1>Remata</h1>

      Welcome to the Remata home page!

      Remata is a flashcard program. 
      Remata was originally developed for Koine Greek -- the Greek of the Bible's New Testament. 
      "Remata" means "words" in Koine. 
      Remata's flashcards can be thought of as knowledge broken down into small units or words.

      Remata was developed by <a href="http://www.theology.edu/QHCC/deacons.html#EricMiller">Eric Miller</a>.
      He has studied and taught Koine (New Testament) Greek for many years.
      He also is a professional software developer.
      As with any language, there is a lot to learn in Greek.
      Eric has long sought after helpful learning tools.
      In particular, he has looked for and tried to develop useful flashcard tools.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many years ago Eric found a spreadsheet of Koine words.
      This spreadsheet was developed by <a href="http://www.lionelwindsor.net/language_tools_greek.html">Lionel Windsor</a>.
      It is a good spreadsheet but Eric felt it needed improvement.
      He radically redesigned the code, added many functions and changed the Greek to a modern unicode font.
      You can see and download the result <a href="Spreadsheet">here</a>. 
      One big feature of flashcards is that they are portable.
      Eric was hoping that the Remata spreadsheet would work on his portable, Windows based PDA.
      Unfortunately it did not.
      The spreadsheet also was exclusive to people who owned Microsoft Excel.
      This lead him to develop a Web version of Remata which is <a href="Web">here</a>.
      As it turned out the web version was also not portable since PDA browsers could not handle the Javascript he used to make it work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eric, who is a T-Mobile customer and Google fan, stumbled across the new Android platform and now owns the T-Mobile G1.
      He developed a version of Remata for Android, which is described <a href="Android">here</a>.
      He finally has a flashcard program that is portable and can handle Koine Greek.
      As a side benefit, the Android version of Remata accepts text files as input.
      It is not limited to Koine Greek but can be used for any type of textual information.
