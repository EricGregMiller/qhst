<b>by Dandi Moyers</b>
<P>
Mallory, I was sitting in church last night praying about Ron
and you when God reminded me about a difficult time not too long
ago that He had brought me through.
<P>
Dennis and I were married three months when I became pregnant.
It was a surprise because we were planning to wait a couple of
years before having kids, but we were both very excited. Dennis
was in the Air Force and had three months until his military commitment
was completed, so we had medical coverage until then. I saw the
base OB and had an ultra-sound at 12 weeks. The baby was growing
and I was eagerly anticipating the first movements. I was sure
I was going to have a little boy. A tiny little version of Dennis
toddling around the house. I imagined all sorts of fun we would
have together and started making plans for his future.
<P>
When I told my friends and family about our big news, everyone
was thrilled, everyone, except Ruth. Ruth and I had become fast
friends after Dennis and I had first met, and I considered her
one of my closest. So close, in fact, I asked her to be the matron
of honor at my wedding. The fact that her reaction to my news
was less than exuberant eluded me. I was so excited that I did
not see the pain that my pregnancy was causing her.
<P>
A few days after we announced that we were expecting Ruth told
me that something was bothering her and that we needed to talk.
It was not long into the conversation that I realized that she
was angry at me and hurt that I could be so callous as to her
feelings. Her anger toward me was so strong and her bitterness
so deep that I was puzzled. At this time, many of our friends
were having children. It seemed as if we had a baby shower almost
every other month at our church for almost a year. Ruth always
seemed happy about the baby boom happening around her, so her
reaction to my news dumbfounded me. I knew that she was unable
to get pregnant. She had been trying for almost seven years, agonizing
over the fact that she may never give birth, then I have the nerve
to go and get pregnant just after getting married. Her attitude
was &quot;Dandi gets whatever she wants, whenever she wants and
nanny-nanny-poo-poo to anyone else.&quot;
<P>
After listening to her vent for about a half hour it occurred
to me that I was not the focus of her rage. She was mad at God.
Mad that He was willingly giving me something that she so desperately
wanted. What made me so deserving and her so undeserving of God's
favor?
<P>
I told her that God's will for our lives is more satisfying than
anything we could want, and that striving after that which God
does not intend for us only makes our lives unhappy. She said
that she wanted a baby more than anything else, even more than
God's will. I was shocked. I so strongly believed that only God's
plan could bring satisfaction and contentment that her response
frightened me. I desperately wanted for her to understand that
His ways are higher and more noble, that we do not know what the
future holds, that only he knows. I told her that I if I had to
lose the baby for her to realize this truth, that it would be
worth it. She guaranteed me that nothing could change the way
she feels, but she now realized that her frustration and anger
were not because of me.
<P>
At about 16 weeks Dennis' enlistment ended and for two months
was unable to find a job. During that time I was not under a doctor's
care but felt that since everything was going well I did not need
to worry. He finally got a job that provided health care at a
local HMO. This particular group had five OB's that shared all
the patients. I was to see a different doctor at each visit so
that when the time came to deliver I would be aquainted with whichever
doctor was on call.
<P>
At my first appointment I was a little over 5 months. They reviewed
my diet and prescribed pre-natal vitamins, took my blood pressure
and I actually got to hear the baby's heartbeat for the very first
time. The doctor asked if movement was normal. I said yes. In
fact it had only been the week before that I had felt the fluttering
for the very first time.
<P>
My subsequent visits were about the same. The heart rate stayed
at a strong 150-155 bpm and the doctor assured me that everything
was going well. At 31 weeks I had my scheduled check and this
doctor (whom I had not seen previously) noticed that no lab work
had been done since I had begun receiving care at the group. The
baby's heart rate at this visit was 132 bpm, which concerned me,
but the doctor assured me that the heart rate will fluctuate between
120-160 bpm and that 132 bpm was absolutely normal. Because he
did not find the 12 week ultra-sound in the records from the base
hospital the doctor scheduled me for a ultra-sound to check the
baby's size and progress.
<P>
My appointment was for the following Friday, the 13th of July.
I could hardly stand the wait. During the last few weeks I was
beginning to wonder if the baby was O.K.. I had never been pregnant
before and was unsure about how much I should be feeling the baby.
The doctors seemed to think everything was normal, so I pushed
my worries aside, not wanting to be a neurotic mommy. The ultra-sound
was just what I needed to put my fears to rest.
<P>
Dennis accompanied me to the appointment. I was disappointed that
he was not allowed to go into the ultra-sound room with me until
all the necessary measurements were taken. The technician assured
us that as soon as she was finished Dennis could come in and see
his baby. She led me to a small, dark room and after helping lie
down on the table began the test. The screen was tilted toward
me so that I could see the images as she was working. Soon after
she began, she turned the screen away from me and asked me why
the doctor had ordered the test. I told her that he just wanted
to check the size and weight to confirm the due date. She began
to look upset, almost irritated, it seemed. I asked if anything
was wrong. She said that nothing was wrong, she just wanted to
go get one of the doctors that was studying to become an OB to
look at my ultra-sound, for the experience. She asked if I was
agreeable to that and I gave my consent.
<P>
Before she even said a word I knew that something was wrong. She
was lying. I could tell by the look in her eyes. As she walked
out of the room I asked the Lord what was wrong. I don't think
I really expected an answer. I think I was just kind of including
God in what was happening. But I did receive an answer. It came
almost before I asked. I didn't hear anything audibly or even
receive a sentence in my mind. It was as if God just dropped this
chunk of knowledge into my head. One second I was clueless, the
next second I knew that my baby was dead. My words to Ruth that
one afternoon rang in my ears; &quot;If I have to lose this baby
for you to understand that God's will for you is more important
than any one thing that you desire, it would be worth it.&quot;
<P>
The doctor and technician came in, re-did the test and acted as
if nothing was wrong. They asked me to join my husband in the
waiting room. The doctor wanted to speak with us. While we waited
I told him that I thought the baby was dead. He didn't say much,
but just held my hand until the nurse came for us.
<P>
She led us to another exam room and told us the doctor would be
with us soon. I'm not sure how long we had to wait but I remember
that we prayed together. We asked God to give us strength and
to honor His word that says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer
and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God.
And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will
guard your hearts and mind in Christ Jesus. (Philippians 4:6-7)</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
We gave thanks that we have a God that loves us enough to comfort
us in time of need, asked him to let us be a witness to those
who don't know Christ, an encouragement to our brothers and sisters
in faith and expected his peace to carry us through.
<P>
The doctor came in and confirmed what God had already revealed
and explained what needed to be done. He was not willing to take
the baby by C-section, preferring to deliver it by induction as
soon as possible. I decided to wait until Monday. I just wanted
a chance to go to church and pray with my friends before going
ahead with the delivery.
<P>
We had phoned ahead, so our pastor, Rick, was already aware of
the situation when we arrived at the church after we left the
doctor's office. We needed some advice about how to tell the rest
of the body, what to do about funeral arrangements and all the
things you never think you'll have to deal with. Ruth and her
husband were there working so I asked them to come into the pastor's
office. After our &quot;big talk&quot; earlier in the year, Ruth
had become wrapped up in the baby. I think she was more excited
about it than I was. She fussed over me like a mother hen, so
when I told her the baby was gone it was hard for her to take.
She fell to her knees and began sobbing. I didn't know how to
comfort her. She told me later that it was as if someone had punched
her in the stomach, it hurt so bad. I don't know if I was numb
or if God simply sustained me, but I didn't cry.
<P>
That evening, as Dennis and I settled into bed The reality of
losing our baby hit us. There wouldn't be a little Dennis to toddle
around our house, no scribbled pictures to hang on the refrigerator
door and there would be no plans for the future of this baby.
We held each other and cried.
<P>
Each night that week Dennis had read aloud one chapter from Psalms.
The five nights preceding had all been psalms of woe and lamentations
about how terrible life is.
<P>
I could not relate, my life was great. But that night, when my
life seemed darkest, the psalmist sang of how wonderful God was.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Praise the LORD, O my soul.
<br>
O LORD my God, you are very great;
<br>
you are clothed with splendor and majesty.
<br>
He wraps himself in light as with a garment;
<br>
he stretches out the heavens like a tent
<br>
and lays the beams of his upper chambers on their waters.
<br>
He makes the clouds his chariot
<br>
and rides on the wings of the wind.
<br>
He makes winds his messengers,
<br>
flames of fire his servants.
<br>
He set the earth on its foundations;
<br>
it can never be moved.
<br>
You covered it with the deep as with a garment;
<br>
the waters stood above the mountains.
<br>
But at your rebuke the waters fled,
<br>
at the sound of your thunder they took to flight;
<br>
they flowed over the mountains,
<br>
they went down into the valleys,
<br>
to the place you assigned for them.
<br>
You set a boundary they cannot cross;
<br>
never again will they cover the earth.
<br>
He makes springs pour water into the ravines;
<br>
it flows between the mountains.
<br>
They give water to all the beasts of the field;
<br>
the wild donkeys quench their thirst.
<br>
The birds of the air nest by the waters;
<br>
they sing among the branches.
<br>
He waters the mountains from his upper chambers;
<br>
the earth is satisfied by the fruit of his work.
<br>
He makes grass grow for the cattle,
<br>
and plants for man to cultivate -
<br>
bringing forth food from the earth:
<br>
wine that gladdens the heart of man,
<br>
oil to make his face shine,
<br>
and bread that sustains his heart.
<br>
The trees of the LORD are well watered,
<br>
the cedars of Lebanon that he planted.
<br>
There the birds make their nests;
<br>
the stork has its home in the pine trees.
<br>
The high mountains belong to the wild goats;
<br>
the crags are a refuge for the coneys.
<br>
The moon marks off the seasons,
<br>
and the sun knows when to go down.
<br>
You bring darkness, it becomes night,
<br>
and all the beasts of the forest prowl.
<br>
The lions roar for their prey and seek their food from God.
<br>
The sun rises, and they steal away;
<br>
they return and lie down in their dens.
<br>
Then man goes out to his work,
<br>
to his labor until evening.
<br>
How many are your works, O LORD!
<br>
In wisdom you made them all;
<br>
the earth is full of your creatures.
<br>
There is the sea, vast and spacious,
<br>
teeming with creatures beyond number -
<br>
living things both large and small.
<br>
There the ships go to and fro,
<br>
and the leviathan, which you formed to frolic there.
<br>
These all look to you to give them their food at the proper time.
<br>
When you give it to them, they gather it up;
<br>
when you open your hand, they are satisfied with good things.
<br>
When you hide your face, they are terrified;
<br>
when you take away their breath, they die and return to the dust.
<br>
When you send your Spirit, they are created,
<br>
and you renew the face of the earth.
<br>
May the glory of the LORD endure forever;
<br>
may the LORD rejoice in his works-
<br>
he who looks at the earth, and it trembles,
<br>
who touches the mountains, and they smoke.
<br>
I will sing to the LORD all my life;
<br>
I will sing praise to my God as long as I live.
<br>
May my meditation be pleasing to him, as I rejoice in the LORD.
<br>
But may sinners vanish from the earth and the wicked be no more.
<br>
Praise the LORD, O my soul. Praise the LORD. (Psalm 104)</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
After hearing this I realized that though I felt as if my world
had been ripped apart for no apparent reason, the creator of the
universe was unchanged. He was still awesome, powerful, just,
merciful and wise. His love for me is deeper and more profound
than any I could ever know. How could I ask Him why? When I gave
Him my life it was for ever, to do with as He willed to bring
glory to His Son Jesus. He never guaranteed me a husband, children,
a home, wealth or even happiness. He did promise to be with me
always and to never give me anything that I was unable to bear.
He gave me His Spirit to strengthen, guide, comfort and protect
me. He gave me His word to teach me. He gave me brothers and sisters
to encourage me and he gave me hope for a future that He alone
commands.
<P>
As I continued to think about this I began to feel blessed that
God had given me this situation. I know it sounds weird, but if
someone had to go through this I feel honored that God let it
be me. There were several women in the church that were pregnant
at the same time and it could have been them. I was thankful that
they were spared this pain, but also grateful that in this pain
God's peace was so freely given to me.
<P>
On Sunday I worshipped the Lord with more intimacy, intensity,
and conviction of heart than ever before. By Monday I was filled
with peace, joy and true thanksgiving for how great a God I serve.
<P>
The induction and delivery took two and a half days. We were surrounded
by family and friends who continually held us up in prayer. On
July 18, 1990 I gave birth to a beautiful red-haired baby girl.
We named her Marissa Ruth Moyers. At a small graveside ceremony
on Monday, July 21st we celebrated the short life that God had
given her.
<P>
Through this the Lord has changed me in ways I never could have
imagined. I have learned that God's Word is faithful and that
it is in life's tragedies that we find life's purpose. I was not
the only person changed by Marissa's death. Ruth came to realize
that God's ways are higher than her own. She began to trust in
God's design for her life. Because she was unable to bear a child
of her own she was able to open her home and her heart to a dying
little foster child named Vanessa. Ruth's acceptance of God's
will saved Vanessa's life and perhaps many more.
<P>
The effects of Marissa's life and death have been felt by many.
God has used this tragedy to comfort and teach, to encourage to
and to show that He does indeed work all things together for the
good of those called according to His plan.
<P>
I hope that during this difficult time you too can be encouraged
by the testimony of Marissa's life. God is faithful to do all
He has promised in His word.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry
about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own. (Matt. 6:34)
<P>
&quot;The LORD bless you and keep you;
<br>
the LORD make his face shine upon you
<br>
and be gracious to you;
<br>
the LORD turn his face toward you
<br>
and give you peace.&quot;
<P>
Grace be with you,</BLOCKQUOTE>
