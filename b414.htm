<P>
 To correctly understand and interpret the text of the New Testament,
one must have a good grasp of the history and archaeology of the
period from Alexander the Great to at least the Bar Kochba revolt;
for it was in this period that the ideas which formed the New
Testament were birthed and brought to fruition.  For example,
on cannot correctly interpret what it means to call Jesus &quot;Lord&quot;
without knowing how the word was used in the Hellenistic world
of the first century.
<P>
 The reading assignments above may seem rather long; but they
must be fairly well in hand by the student if the student hopes
to grasp what needs to be grasped in the remarks that follow.
<P>
 Alexander the Great was ruler of Macedonia and later ruler of
Greece and the entire civilized world (from the Tiber to the Tigris
-- as one writer has said).  Alexander ruled from 336-323 BC 
He conquered the Persian s who had earlier conquered Palestine
and thus Alexander became &quot;lord&quot; of the Jews.  Alexander's
conquest of Palestine was not a violent even t, however; it simply
came to his hands with the rest of the Persian empire.  Alexander
passed along the coast of Palestine from Tyre to Gaza in 332 and
was given free will offerings by both Samaria and Jerusalem. 
This seems to have been his only contact with Palestine.
<P>
 The most impressive activity of Alexander, and the one which
was to have the most significant result was his spreading of &quot;Hellenism&quot;
in the wake of his military victories.  But Alexander also assimilated
a great deal in his travels so that as he spread Greek culture
he also spread Iranian and Egyptian culture.  In Alexander East
met West and the two were fused together.
<P>
 For the Jews of Palestine the advent of Greek culture was a mixed
blessing.  In the wake of Hellenism the Jews were the recipients
of Greek culture, Greek style cities (including the gymnasium-
wherein the athletes exercised in the nude!  A great shock to
the Jews!!), the Greek language, an d the idea of the &quot;divine
king&quot; (which Alexander learned from Persia) 2E  All of these
contributions fed the thought of the early Church like streams
feed a river.
<P>
 When Alexander died his empire was divided among his generals.
 Egypt an d Palestine fell to the Ptolemies; while Syria fell
to the Seleucids.  Both of these powers would control Palestine
before the advent of the Roman Empire.
<P>
 The Ptolemies ruled Palestine from 320 to 200 BC  <P>

 The Ptolemies were essentially benevolent to the Jews of Palestine, allowing them a great deal of self rule even though Palestine itself was administered as &quot;temple lands&quot;.  That is,
the priests of Egypt received t he monetary benefit of Palestinian
trade.
<P>
 In 202 the Syrians, after several attempts, were able to drive
the Ptolemies from Palestine and thus began one of the most trying
times of the hi story of the Jews after the exile.  The Syrians
(or Seleucids) ruled Palestine from 200 till 142 BC.  <P>

 The Syrians were much more savage in their rule of Palestine
than the Ptolemies were.  And the most savage of them all was
Antiochus IV.  He outlawed reading of the Jewish law and indeed
even the owning of it.  He persecuted the Jews to the point of
extinction and then erected for himself a statue of Zeus in the
Jerusalem Temple and sacrificed a sow on the altar as a sign of
his contempt for the Jewish religion.  Needless to say, he was
reviled by the Jews.  His incredible cruelty gave rise to a horrid
persecution which saw the birth of the Apocalyptic movement and
the writing of the Book of Daniel.
<P>
 The response of the Jews to this time of terror was what came
to be know n as the Maccabean revolt.  The Maccabeans were successful
in overthrowing Syrian rule of Palestine and so for the first
time in many centuries the Jews were politically, religiously,
and economically free.<P>

 These Maccabeans sometimes were simultaneously High priest and
king.  The rule they inaugurated was rejected by some of the more
pious people and these people split off and went into the desert
to a place called Khirbet Qumran where they came to be known as
the &quot;Essenes&quot;.  The general populace of the land was
indifferent to the Maccabean (or Hasmonean) rulers.  However the
powerful Pharisees were opposed to their leadership (for they
saw them as far to acculturated to Hellenism).  The Pharisees
thus continuously stirred up discontent among the people; and
the Sadducees (the supporters of Hellenism and the Hasmoneans)
kept up their support of the ruling class.
<P>
 After a brief period of repose- the kingdom was again thrown
into turmoil because of the constant in-fighting.  By this time
the mighty Romans had appeared on the horizon and were not pleased
with unrest on their borders.
<P>
 The Hasmoneans appealed to Rome for assistance in the struggle
and the Romans were pleased to respond- by annexing the land of
Palestine as a new segment of the empire and by setting on the
throne of Israel the half-Jewish, half-Edomite king Herod the
Great.  The year was 37 BC  Thus the brief period of independence
came to an end and the Jews were once again under the dominion
of a foreign power.
<P>
 Herod the Great was perhaps the most competent ruler (in his
early reign ) that the Jews would see in the Roman period.  He
was a man of great genius and, unfortunately, great cruelty. 
He built temples, aqueducts, gymnasiums, cities, and ports.  He
was a consummate politician and his brilliance was famous.  But
the dark side of Herod is that part of him which is generally
remembered.  He was amazingly cruel and extraordinarily suspicious.
 He killed his wife, many of his children, and countless innocents
merely because he was suspicious of them.
<P>
 As Herod grew older he became ridden with disease and paranoia.
 His final wish was that when he died, all of the village leaders
throughout Palestine would be killed so that someone would mourn.
 This wish was not granted -- and upon his death there was great
celebration throughout the country.
<P>
 During the last months of his reign, Herod would be told by some
messengers from the east that a king had been born in Bethlehem.
 This incensed Herod; but it helps us immensely because it aids
us in dating the birth o f Jesus to 4 BC- for that is the year
in which Herod died.
<P>
 Thus, in the period from Alexander to Herod the seeds were planted
in Palestine that would issue forth in the movements and ideas
that determined the course and shape of Christianity for centuries
to follow.  It is to an investigation of  the concrete shaping
of those forms that we must now turn.
