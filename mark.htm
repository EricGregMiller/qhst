<P>
<B>The Book of Mark</B> 
<P>
<B>I. Title</B> 
<P>
The title comes from the name of the apparent author of the book.
<P>
<B>II. Author and Setting</B> 
<P>
Tradition points to John Mark as the author of this Gospel, the
same John Mark who was companion to Paul and Barnabas; it was
over Mark's behavior in leaving and Barnabas' desire to bring
Mark with them, that lead to Barnabas and Paul splitting up (See
Acts 13:13, 15:36-40). Later, Paul was to accept Mark again (see
Colossians 4:10, 2 Timothy 4:11).
<P>
Tradition also asserts that Mark was in some way associated with
Peter, and that Peter furnished the materials and information
that make up this book. In fact, some ancient writers called this
book Peter's gospel.
<P>
Regarding the relationship of Mark's gospel to the others, and
chronological matters, see the introduction to the book of <A HREF="matthew.htm">Matthew</A>.

<P>
The questions for the book of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John have
been combined into one set of questions located at the end of
the introduction to the book of <A HREF="john.htm">John</A>.
The questions should be answered after reading all four gospels.
