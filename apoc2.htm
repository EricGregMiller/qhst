<b>1.  Introduction to Apocalyptic Literature</b>
<P>
What we call &quot;apocalyptic&quot; is a style of literature
which appears on the scene of early Judaism at the beginning of
the third century before the common era. Some scholars suggest
that apocalyptic arose because certain promises found in the Old
Testament had not been fulfilled. Thus, in an attempt to rescue
God from the scourge of doubt, such promises were pressed from
the present into the future, rescuing the prophet and God from
the accusation of falsehood. This &quot;end time&quot; mentality,
which &quot;unveils&quot; the future, was called by its Greek
name, apokaluyiV (apocalypsis), which literally means &quot;unveiling&quot;.
<P>
Other scholars (notably Gerhard von Rad) suggest that apocalyptic
literature arose as a response to the failure of wisdom to meet
the challenge of the Maccabean crisis. von Rad supposed that the
writers of the apocalyptic materials were disciples of the wisdom
school who were disenchanted with wisdom's failure to help out
in the period of crisis brought about by Antiochus Epiphanes.
Thus, such apocalypticists, convinced that God did indeed punish
the wicked and reward the righteous, pushed these promises from
this life to the next. Hence there arose the notion that if good
deeds are not recognized in this life, they will be in the next.
<P>
Both of these approaches to the study of apocalyptic (from prophetic
roots and from wisdom roots) attempt to draw a line of continuity
from Israel's past to its present life in crisis. Such a line
of continuity is, regrettably, not only impossible to demonstrate
but it is also unnecessary.
<P>
Apocalyptic arose as a literature of crisis. Suffering folk turned
to future hope in an effort to ameliorate their present hardship.
So, when we read apocalyptic literature's we need to put ourselves
in the mindset of people who suffer oppression, hardship, or persecution.
Thus, to take a few Biblical examples, Daniel was written as a
word of comfort to those suffering under Antiochus Epiphanes.
Mark 13 was written to help those suffering the destruction of
Jerusalem in 70 CE. And Revelation, the most famous apocalypse,
was composed to assist those who were suffering under the persecution
of Domitian, emperor of Rome at the end of the first century CE.
What all these writings have in common is the fact that they were
written to help folk look to the future rather thannow in a position
to examine particular apocalypses in order to flesh out this basic
thesis.
