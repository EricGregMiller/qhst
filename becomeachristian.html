      <h2 class="Small">Consequently, since it is our nature to sin, there is nothing we can do to

        <span class="HeadText">Romans 3:10-12</span> As it is written There is no one righteous, not even one; 
      there is no one who understands, no one who seeks God. All have turned away, 
      they have together become worthless; there is no one who does good, not even 
      one.

        <span class="HeadText">Isaiah 63:5</span> I looked, but there was no one to help, I was appalled that 
      no one gave support; so my own arm worked salvation for me, and my own wrath 
      sustained me.
      <P>
        <img src="graphix/book-small.gif" style="float:left"><span class="HeadText">Isaiah 43:11</span>
        I, even I, am the LORD, and apart from me there is no savior.

        <h2 class="Small">He did this, by sending his son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross for the

            <img src="graphix/book-small.gif" style="float:left">
          <span class="HeadText">Romans 5:7-10</span> Very rarely will anyone die for a righteous man, though for 
        a good man someone might possibly dare to die. But God demonstrates his own 
        love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us. Since we 
        have now been justified by his blood, how much more shall we be saved from 
        God's wrath through him! For if, when we were God's enemies, we were reconciled 
        to him through the death of his Son, how much more, having been reconciled, 
        shall we be saved through his life!
        <br>
        <hr class="HorizontalDividerBarThinGrey">
        <h2 class="Small">If we decide to accept the gift of his death, and turn our lives over to God, 
          then he puts his Holy Spirit inside us, making us Christians. Becoming a 
          Christian is entirely the work of God; we do not contribute to it ourselves. No 
          amount of being good will make a person a Christian, because being good has 
          nothing to do with it.</h2>

          <span class="HeadText">Galatians 3:1-5</span>
      You foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you? Before your very eyes Jesus 
      Christ was clearly portrayed as crucified. I would like to learn just one thing 
      from you Did you receive the Spirit by observing the law, or by believing what 
      you heard? Are you so foolish? After beginning with the Spirit, are you now 
      trying to attain your goal by human effort? Have you suffered so much for 
      nothing -- if it really was for nothing? Does God give you his Spirit and work 
      miracles among you because you observe the law, or because you believe what you 
      heard?
      <P>
        <img src="graphix/book-small.gif" style="float:left"><span class="HeadText">Ephesians 2:8-9</span>
        For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith -- and this not from 
        yourselves, it is the gift of God -- not by works, so that no one can boast.
        <br>
        <hr class="HorizontalDividerBarThinGrey">
        <h2 class="Small">Becoming a Christian results inevitably and automatically in obedience to 
          Christ. The first act of obedience is baptism -- being immersed in water -- to 
          signify to friends and family that one has died and been buried with Christ, 
          raised to live a new life in Him.</h2>

          <span class="HeadText">Ephesians 2:10</span>
      For we are God's workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which 
      God prepared in advance for us to do.
      <P>
        <img src="graphix/book-small.gif" style="float:left"><span class="HeadText">Acts 2:41</span> Those 
        who accepted his message were baptized, and about three thousand were added to 
        their number that day.
        <br>
        <hr class="HorizontalDividerBarThinGrey">
        <h2 class="Small">Good works are the consequence of becoming a Christian, not the cause. But the 
          good works that are done are the work of God through the Christian, not the 
          Christian's own efforts. Therefore there is no place for pride or 
          self-righteousness.</h2>
          <P>
            <img src="graphix/book-small.gif" style="float:left">
          <span class="HeadText">Galatians 6:14</span>
      May I never boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which 
      the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.
      <P>
        <img src="graphix/book-small.gif" style="float:left"><span class="HeadText">Romans 3:27-28</span>
      Where, then, is boasting? It is excluded. On what principle? On that of 
      observing the law? No, but on that of faith. For we maintain that a man is 
      justified by faith apart from observing the law.
      <P>
        <img src="graphix/book-small.gif" style="float:left"><span class="HeadText">Galatians 2:20-21</span>
        I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. 
        The life I live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me 
        and gave himself for me. I do not set aside the grace of God, for if 
        righteousness could be gained through the law, Christ died for nothing!
