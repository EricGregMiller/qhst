<P>
 Every historical document (and every document is historical in
the sense that it is written at some specific time and in some
specific place) must be understood in light of  that historical
situation.  For instance, if we were to see a newspaper headline
that said &quot;WAR DECLARED&quot; it would mean one thing if
the dateline was 1941 and another thing if it said 1991.  In short,
to understand any piece of writing we must have some glimmer of
the context in which it was written.
<P>
 The same is true of the documents that have been collected in
what we call the Old Testament.  To grasp the meaning of these documents it is
essential that the serious student of the Bible have some grasp
on the historical events which gave them birth and shaped their
development.
Recent studies in the fields of OT History and Archaeology now suggest that it is quite possible, and even likely, that many of the documents contained in the OT were in fact written during the Hasmonean period of Israel’s history!  Scholars like Niels Peter Lemche of Copenhagen University and Philip Davies of Sheffield University have been maintaining for years that the texts we find in the OT were produced during this late age and that the historical material in the OT is therefore quite minimal.  To Davies and Lemche (as well as many others) the OT texts we now have are simply retrojecting Israel into the past in order to justify its presence in the land in the (Hasmonean) present.<p>
The Archaeological work of Helga Weippart of Wuppertal University has supported this late dating of the OT materials because, as she shows, there is simply no archaeological evidence for a distinct group called Israelites in the pre-hasmonean period.   Jericho was destroyed, sure enough; but 400 years before the Biblical text has it destroyed.  Jerusalem was little more than a hamlet until the Hasmonean period.  There is no evidence of a United Kingdom.  These archaeological discoveries lend credence to the theories of Davies and Lemche.  But until further material is forthcoming and further study can be done their views remain provisional (though possible).
<P>
 To gain an overview (for that is all we can accomplish in the
course of one year) of the events and personalities which are
the background of the Old Testament, we will simply follow the
outline above.  We will necessarily be brief on some topics and
more detailed in others.  But by the time the student has completed
all three sections of the course, he or she should have a fairly
good view of the Old Testament world.
<P>
 Our study begins with the 3rd millennium BC.   This was a very
important time in the history of the Ancient Near East and thus
for the Old Testament peoples as well.  This era saw the birth
of the great powers which would swap control of the area for the
next 2000 years.  Egypt, Babylonia, and Assyria, all began to
walk into the light of history in this period.  The peoples of
the steppes and plains of the Tigris-Euphrates river valley began
to migrate to the west, north, and east.  Some of these peoples
were called by their settled neighbors the &quot;habiru&quot;
-- the nomads.
<P>
 The deities which would be worshipped in these territories for
millennium were being served by priests and chiefs; the world
of the Near East was experiencing growth and relative prosperity.
 The Egyptians were building temples and cataracts while the Babylonians
developed irrigation and a pantheon of great significance.  Cities
were being born and nomads were becoming city dwellers.  The chiefs
of great cities were conquering lesser cities and the citizens
of those cities were made into the servant of the conqueror. 
The priestly caste was developing writing; and the kings were
becoming more and more powerful.  Sumerians and Babylonians and
Mesopotamians and a hundred small tribes long lost in the dust
of history were active and alive.  Technology was being developed
and life was becoming easier for the wealthy elite.
<P>
 In short, life in the Ancient Near East was improving and there
was no significant turmoil on the horizon to spoil the hopeful
outlook held by many.
<P>
 The following chart will help to put in perspective the significant
events of the 3rd millennium BC:

 As this chart shows, there was a great deal of activity around
Palestine during this period of history.  The Egyptians and the
Sumerians were building empires while the inhabitants of Palestine
were building small city states.  From one of the cities of the
Chaldean empire, Ur, the people of Israel were to spring from
their ancestor Abraham.  Those who would later be known as Israelites
began their history in the mists of ancient Chaldea.  They would
come to be known as Hebrews because they were nomads,  &quot;habiru,&quot;
who wandered from their ancestral home to the land of the Canaanites.
<P>
 It is to their ancestor, Abraham, that we now turn.  He lived
at the dawn of the second millennium and became the ancestor of
a people who have outlived all of their Ancient Near Eastern contemporaries.
 There are Jews, but there are no more Edomites or Assyrians,
or Babylonians or Hittites or Sumerians.  Who was Abraham and
how did he live?  These are the questions on which we now must
focus our attention as we move from the 3rd millennium to the
second.

<P>
<B>ASSIGNMENT: Read Genesis 12- 25; <I>Broadman Bible Commentary</I>, 
vol. 1., pages 34-48.</B>
<P>
 The story of Abraham brings us, in our progress through the history
of the Old Testament, for the first time onto the stage of Biblical history. (Though, quite frankly, there is no archaeological evidence or extra-biblical evidence of any kind to corroborate this material).
 The first eleven chapters of Genesis have to do with the incursion
and spread of sin; while the story of Abraham begins the historical
account of God's solution to the problem of sin.  Abraham is to
be the father of many nations who will be blessed by him.  He
will, eventually, be the ancestor of the one who solved the sin
problem ultimately and completely -- Jesus the Christ.
<P>
 Who was this Abraham (whose name was Abram when we first meet
him)?  
<P>
Abraham began life in one of the more significant city states
of the Sumerian empire.  Ur (Tell el-Muqayyar), in south-Babylon,
was the political and religious center of Sumeria and Akkadia.
 He migrated from there to Haran and eventually to Canaan.  The
archaeologist W.F. Albright believed that Abraham was one of the
many &quot;Donkey-caravaners&quot; who traveled and traded along
the route from the south of Sumeria to the borders of Egypt during
the end of the 2nd millennium BC
<P>
 Abram, or Abraham most likely means &quot;the father is exalted.&quot;
 The situations which the Old Testament describe Abraham being
involved in, were typical of the nomadic lifestyle.  He lived
in tents and not houses; he struggled for position in the territory
he inhabited as a &quot;stranger;&quot; he conducted battles for
possession of wells to supply his caravan with water; and he traveled
a great deal.  
<P>
 His travels took him to places like Bethel, Shechem, Hebron,
Beersheba, Gerar, Gilead, Penuel, and Succoth, among others in
the land of Canaan.  He worshipped at the sanctuaries of the Cannanites
at Beersheba (where El-Olam was worshipped); and at Beerlacharoi
(where El-Roi was worshipped) and at Shechem (where Ba'al Berith
was worshipped).  Abraham's life was thus a migratory one; wherein
he was constantly moving from place to place.  Beyond these facts,
there is little that can be said about the historical Abraham,.  Or indeed, that there was a historical Abraham at all (for, according to Lemche, the name is simply an eponym),
so we will move on to the next segment of  Israel's history. as described in the OT
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I> 2. The Patriarchal Period</I></BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

<P>
<B>ASSIGNMENT: Read Genesis 26-50.</B>
<P>
 The period of the Patriarchs is perhaps the most difficult to
describe historically.  The reason is simple -- there is a dearth
of evidence for this period.  In fact, what has been said of Abraham
can also be said of the patriarchs as well.  They were &quot;donkey-nomads&quot;
who traveled from trade post to trade post.  Though this too is highly questionable.  The story of Joseph's
sale to the Midianites is excellent attestation of this kind of
existence.  After all, how did the brothers know who to sell Joseph
to if they did not have some experience in the matter.
<P>
 The patriarchs all evidently died in Egypt where they eventually
wound up after the Joseph episode concluded in a happy manner.
 Thus, the period of Israel's sojourn in Egypt is a long period
of silence in the history of Ancient Israel.  <BR>

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I> 3. The Egyptian Period</I></BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

<P>
 Egypt was, in the period of Israel's sojourn there, an empire
to reckon with.  The 18th Dynasty saw Pharaohs of the most incredible
brilliance and intellectual power.  Amenhotep IV ( 1353-1336 BC)
known to many as Akhenaton was the Pharaoh who introduced monotheism
to the Egyptian people.  For this act of kindness the people of
Egypt (led by the many priests!) eradicated, to the best of their
ability, any memory of him after his death.  He was succeeded
by a series of lesser rulers because the empire was in turmoil.
 The period of tumult was ended by the founding of a new dynasty
-- the 19th, which saw the erruption of the Ramessides onto the
scene of Egyptian politics.
<P>
<B> Ramses I</B> (1292-1290 BC) transferred the capital to the delta
region.
<P>
<B>Seti I </B>(1290-1279 BC) was a brilliant military leader who kept
Egypt's fragile empire together.  But it is Ramses II whom most
students of the Bible know.  He ruled Egypt with an iron fist
from 1279- 1213 BC  and was the pharaoh (so many think) who ruled
during the Exodus from Egypt of the descendants of Abraham.
<P>
 The pharaohs (from, interestingly enough, a word in Egyptian
that means &quot;Bull&quot;) were, for the most part, at the mercy
of the priests.  They were essentially figureheads who were expected
to make the lives of the priests enjoyable -- or the priests would
invoke the gods on their behalf.  Upon death (when they were well
out of sight), the priests would deify the Pharaoh -- and thus they
came to be known as divine.
<P>
 This was the world of the Exodus.  The event which will now be
the focus of our attention is, therefore, the Exodus itself.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>4. Moses</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<B>ASSIGNMENT: Read Exodus - Deuteronomy; Mays, <I>Oxford Bible Atlas</I>,
pages 1 -59.</B>
<P>
The figure of Moses is so powerful and towering in the history
of Israel that it is virtually impossible to see Israel without him. From the plagues to the Exodus to the mountain to the wandering
to the border of the land.
<P>
The material which serves as a source for the history of Moses
are the books of Exodus through Deuteronomy. There are no external
sources which speak of Moses. Thus, the history of Moses, set
in the period of Ramses II, can be gleaned only from there.
<P>
Yet the figure of Moses has, over the years, been interpreted
in a vast variety of ways. He has been seen as:
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI> a mythical figure
<LI>a religious guru<LI>a reformer <LI>the founder of a People
(the father of his country, like George Washington) <LI>the founder
of a sect<LI>a theologian
<LI>a magician<LI>a lawgiver (like Hammurabi) <LI> a prophet<LI>
a priest <LI> a charismatic leader
</UL>
<P> Thus Moses has served
as a mirror to the imagination of the writer attempting to describe
him. Perhaps, indeed, he was most of these things. What is certain
is the fact that Moses hold s a central position in the history
and religion of Israel. It is Moses as the leader of the Exodus
which will be our interest, however, from this point.
<P>
The Exodus began, formally, when Israel left Egypt on the night
of the death of Pharaoh's son. This event must have taken place
early in the reign of Ramses II for a number of reasons: first
-- it would have taken several years for a Pharaoh to consolidate
his power, and thus he was relatively weak in the earliest years
of his reign. Second, his son Merneptah erected a stele in Canaan
which specifically mentions Israel. Thus Israel must have been
in the land for some period of time. If Merneptah (who ruled till
1204 BC) erected the stele towards the end of his reign (as
seems reasonable) and Israel left Egypt early in the Reign of
Ramses II (remembering that he ruled from 1279- 1213 BC),
then this would allow time for the 40 years of wandering and for
the tribes to take up bas ic positions in the land. The following
chronology seems likely. The exodus took place around 1277; the
people wandered 40 years and arrived in the land around 1237.
They dispersed and settled for the next several years becoming
established in the land -- so that when Merneptah erects his memorial
stone in 1205 the people have dwelt in the land for some 30 odd
years.
<P>
The various stories which are found in the Old Testament concerning
the route of the exodus and the events of the period of wandering
are neither verifiable nor unverifiable from external historical
sources.
