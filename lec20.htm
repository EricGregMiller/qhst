<h1><b>Israel and the Assyrians</b></h1>
<P>
 From the disruption of the Israelite Monarchy (c. 922 bC) until
the fall of the Northern Kingdom two centuries later, two primary
factors influenced the history of Syria-Palestine.  One, as discussed
in preceeding lectures, was the rapid rise to power of the Arameans
of Damascus.  The otheer, seen to be partly concomitant with it,
was the ominous advance of a newly awakened Assyria, whose encroachments
upon the west led to the most perpelexing changes in the state
of affairs in Syria.  Now the Arameans were engaged in bitter
warfare against the Israelites, now in alliance with them against
the Assyrians.  Now Israelites or Arameans were in league with
Assyria or with one another against the Southern Kingdom of Judah.
<P>
 In the period following Hazael's death (c. 801 bC), Israel was
able in an astonishing manner not only to regain the former prestige
and power it had enjoyed under the Omrides, but also to reach
the peak of its wealth and the period of its greatest territorial
expansion.  This was made possibleby victories over the Arameans
and an extended hiatus in the Assyrian advance in the west.  But
the Assyrian lull was only the stillness that preceded the storm,
which was eventually to break with such violence as to sweep away
both Damascus and Israel as well.
<P>
<B>Israel and the Decline of Damascus</B>
<P>
 However, before Assyria's protracted withdrawal from central
and south Syria, Adadnirari III (805-782 BC) was able to strike
a terrific blow at Damascus which was sufficiently crippling to
enable the Israelites to throw off the shackles the Arameans and
fastened upon them and to regain their former boundaries.  On
the inscribed stele of this Assyrian king (discovered in 1905)
Adadnirari writes:
<P>
<blockquote> Against Aram [Syria] I marched.  Mari', king of Aram, in Damascus
his royual city, I shut up.  The terrifying splendor of assur
[the national god of the Asyrians]...overwhelmed him and he laid
hold of my feet, he became my vassal.  2300 talents of silver,
20 talents of gold, 3000 talents of coper, 5000 talents of iron,
colored woolen and linen garments, an ivory bed, an ivory couch...his
property and his goods, in immeasurable quantity, in Damascus,
his royal city, in his palace, I received.</blockquote>
<P>
 By the enigmatic appelation Mari' (&quot;my lord&quot;) the Assyrians
evidently refer to Hazael toward the latter end of whose reign
there was a decisive weakening of Aramean power, rather than to
his son and successor, Benhadad II.  In any case, there are no
grounds for inserting another king named Mari' either before or
after Benhadad II.  The &quot;name&quot; is rather to be construed
as &quot;the title which had replace dthe royal name in current
language&quot; and which in this instance was employed by Adadnirari
III for Hazael, since it is difficult to place Hazael's death
earlier than 801 BC.
<P>
<B>Joash and Benhadad II.</B>  The task of restoring Israelite
fortunes was reserved for Joahaz, the twefth king of Israel (c.
801-786 BC), who &quot;took again out of the hand of Benhadad,
the son of Hazael, the cities which he had taken out of the hand
of Joahaz his father by war.  Three times did Joash smite him,
and recovered the cities of Israel&quot; (2 Kings 13:25).
<P>
 Benhadad II, accordingly, signally failed to protect the Syrian
conquests his father Hazael had won in the south.  Joash's vigorous
restoration of the Israelite state, indicated not only by his
Aramean successes but also by important victories won in a war
with Amaziah of Judah (2 Kings 13:12; 14:12), clearly put Benhadad
II on the defensive, at least insofar as Israel was concerned.
<P>
<B>Benhadad II and Zakir of Hamath.</B>  Although Aramean power
suffered in southern Syria, the prestige of Benhadad II displayed
remarkable vitality in the north, as shown by the important stele
of Zakir, king of Hamath, discovered in 1903 at modern Afis southwest
of Aleppo in northern Syria.  This important monument, published
by the discoverer H. Pognon in 1907, makes a significant reference
in lines four and five to Benhadad II.  Under the Aramaic form
of the name, &quot;Barhadad, son of Hazael, king of Aram&quot;
is presented as heading a coalition of twelve to eighteen kings
against &quot;Zakir, king of Hamath and Lu'ash&quot;.  The operations
of the confederacy, in which only seven of the kings take part,
as Zakir expressly mentions, are directed against Hazrek (biblical
Hadrach of Zechariah 9:1), the capital city of Lu'ash, a north
Syrian principality southwest of Aleppo, and north of Hamath on
the Orontes.
<P>
 The real cause of the attack of the hostile coalition under Benhadad
II was the merger of two powerful and independent states, Hamath
and Lu'ash.  This political move so upset the balance of power
in Syria, and was attended with such a seriious threat to the
autonomy of Damascus and other Syrian states, that they were ready
to go to war in order to break it up.  Benhadad iI especially
had reason to be made sensitive to any added threat to Syrian
power since his losses to Israel in the south had seriously curtailed
his sway in that direction.  Moreover, Zakir's victory over the
coalition, in the celebration of which he set up his stele, furnished
another indication of declining Aramean might.
<P>
<B>Jeroboam II and the Subjugation of Damascus.</B>  The successes
of Joash against Syria were continued with uninterrupted achievement
by his son Jeroboam II (c. 786-746 BC).  This notable era of Israel's
expansion and prosperity was made possible as much by Assyria's
comparative weakness and inaction in the west during Jeroboam
II's long reign as by the rapid decline of Damascus.
<P>
 In the brief notices in the Book of Kings the &quot;might&quot;
of Jeroboam is stressed and &quot;how he recovered Damascus and
Hamath, which had belonged to Judah, for Israel&quot; (2 Kings
14:28) and how &quot;he restored the border of Israel from the
entrance of Hamath unto the sea of the 'Arabah&quot; (2 Kings
14:25).  This meant the conquest of Damascus and the extension
of Israelite sway at least to the souternmost extremities of Hamath
to the north, called &quot;the approaches to hamath.&quot;  Since
the days of the conquest, this point had been recognized as the
accepted northern boundary of the promised land (Josh. 13:5),
realized in the period of Israel's greatest territorial control
in the Davidic-Solomonic era (2 Sam. 8:5-11) and restored as a
result of Jeroboam II's military successes.
<P>
 In the case of Damascus, Jeroboam's victories embraced the actual
subjugation of the city and not a mere tributary relationship,
as Alfred Jepsen supposes.  The biblical notices dealing with
Jeroboam's military prowess plainly imply such a conquest, and
it is supported by other lines of evidence proving the extraordinary
prosperity of Jeroboam's reign.
<P>
 Excavations at Samaria have confirmed the splendor of the Israelite
capital in the eighth century BC.  Jeroboam II refortified the
city with a double wall, reaching to as much as thirty-three feet
in width in exposed sections, comprising fortifications so substantial
that the Assyrian army took three years to capture the city (2
Kings 17:5).  The more splendid palace, built of limestone and
boasting a strong rectangular tower and an extensive outer court,
which has hitherto been assigned to Ahab, almost certainly belongs
to Jeroboam II.  The jasper seal of &quot;Shema, servant of Jeroboam&quot;,
discovered by Schumacher at Megiddo, is to be identified with
Jeroboam II, as is now epigraphically certain.  The lifelike and
magnificently executed lion, which appears on it, furnishes evidence
of the state of art during this era.
<P>
 In addition to archeology, Amos' prophecies shed light on the
increased commerce and wealth of Jeroboam's realm with consequent
luxury and moral decline.  Tribute from a greatly augmented territory
flowed into the coffers of Samaria and created a very wealthy
class, consisting largely of the ruling strata and court favorites.
 Glaring social and economic inequalities were fostered by the
selfish and unscrupulous conduct of the rich (Amos 2:6, 8:6).
<P>
 Simple dwellings of unburned brick gave way to &quot;houses of
hewn stone&quot; and Ahab's ivory palace (decorations only are
meant) was imitated by many of the wealthy of the land (Amos 3:15,
5:11, 1 Kings 22:39).  Luxurious feasts were the order of the
day (Amos 6:4-6).  Religion degenerated into mere ritualism devoid
of righteousness and morality (Amos 4:4, 5:5, 8:14).
<P>
 As Amos had foreseen, this unhealthy prosperity, engendering
a false sense of security and erected upon a flimsy foundation
of mral and social injustice, was not destined to be permanent.
 The house of Jeroboam was to be visited with the sword (Amos
7:9) and the people were to be carried into captivity (Amos 5:27),
predictions which the next quarter of a century was to justify
fully.  Somewhere around 746 BC Jeroboam died a natural death,
but after a brief reign of only six months his son and successor,
Zechariah, was murdered by an usurper.  This initiated a period
of sharp decline and destructive civil war.
<P>
<B>Israel and the Advance of Assyria</B>
<P>
 After the reign of the famous queen Semiramis and her son Adadnirari
III (810-783 BC), the power of Assyria declined.  Shalmaneser
IV (782-733 BC), Ashurdan III (722-755 BC) and Ashurnirari V (754-745
BC) were weak rulers and offered no peril to the west.  Under
their preoccupation with problems at home, Jeroboam II of Israel
was able to extend his power in Syria almost unchallenged.
<P>
<B>Menahem and Tiglathpileser III.</B>  Precisely about the time
of Jeroboam II's death and the assassination of his son shortly
afterward, momentous events were transpiring in Assyria.  A great
warrior and statesman (in his day he was called a tyrant.  Now
that he is dead he is called a statesman.  Now you know the definition
of a statesman: a dead politician), Tiglath pileser III (745-727
BC) ursurped the throne.  Like his famous predecessor Tiglathpileser
I (c. 1114-c. 1076 BC), a mighty conqueror wose name he assumed
and who first lifted Assyria to the status of a great power, Tiglathpileser
III brought the moribund Assyrian Empire to vigborous life.
<P>
 In Babylon, where he was also recognized as king, the new empire
builder was known as Pulu (perhaps his original name before he
assumed the title of Tiglathpileser?).  It was as Pul that he
was popularly known to the Israelites.  Under this name he is
mentioned as exacting tribute from Menahem (c. 745-738 BC), who
succeeded to the throne of Israel after Shallum, the murder or
Jeroboam's son Zechariah, had reigned only one month.  The biblical
account runs this way: &quot;There came against the land Pul,
king of Assria; and Menahem gave Pul a thousand talents of silver,
that his hand might be with him to confirm the kingdom in his
hand&quot; (1 Kings 15:19).
<P>
 It is interesting to note that this same event is mentioned in
the annals of the great Assyrian king: &quot;As for Menahem, terror
overwhelmed him, like a bird, alone he fled and submitted to me.
 To his place I brought him back and...silver, colored woolen
garments, linen garments...I received as his tribute.&quot;
<P>
<B>Rezin and the Resurgence of Aramean power.</B>  The civil confusion
and weakness incident upon the death of Jeroboam gave Damascus
opportunity to shake off Israelite control and to assume sufficient
importance to appear once more in contempoarary sources.  Rezin
(c. 750-732 BC), the last Aramean king to rule at Damascus, appears
in the Annals of Tiglathpileser III as &quot;Rasunnu of Aram&quot;.
 With &quot;Menihimmu&quot; (Menahem) of &quot;Samerina&quot;
(Samaria) and the kings of Tyre, Gebal (Byblus), Carchemish (Qarqar),
Hamath, etc., Rezin is mentioned as paying tribute to his Assyrian
overlord early in the reign of Tiglathpileser III, evidently in
this third year (742 BC).
<P>
<B>Azariah of Judah and the Assyrian Peril.</B>  Tiglathpileser
III's westward advance in 743 BC, as a result of which both Menahem
of Israel and Rezin of Damascus eventually had to pay tribute,
had called forth a new Syrian-Palestinian coalition to stem the
tde.  The natural leader of such an alliance was Judah under Azariah
(c. 783-742 BC), who headed by far the strongest and most ifluential
state in Syria-Palestine at the time.  Tiglathpileser, moreover,
makes clear reference in his Annals to Aziriyau of Yaudu (or Yaudi)
in connection with what is obviously such a coalition.
<P>
 Azaraiah's disappearance from the Assyrian records with no mention
of his fate, except that the far-reaching coalition he headed
was smashed by the military prowess of Tiglathpileser III, would
indicate that he died shortly afterward, probably not later than
742 BC, and in any case before the Assyrians could take punitive
action against him.
<P>
Pekah and Rezin's War Against Ahaz.  The speed with which the
defeated allies came to terms with the invading Assyrians and
the subsequent events of the reign of Ahaz (c. 735-715 BC) show
that Israel and Damascus on the one hand and Judah under Azariah
on the other, had merely been foul-weather friends, as Ahab and
Benhadad I more than a century earlier had been.  When burdensome
Assyrian tribute in the intervening years necessitated the formation
of a new coalition to throw off the oppressor's yoke under Pekah
of Israel (c. 735-732 BC), the Israelite king found a ready ally
in Rezin of Damascus, if indeed the latter was not the real promulgator
of the new combination, as Alfred Jepsen argues.
<P>
 Tiglathpileser's campaign in Urartu in Armenia (737-735 BC) created
a breathing space for the consolidation of a Syrian-Palestinian
coalition.  Under pressure from Israel and Syria such Palestinian
states as Philistia and Edom joined the new alliance.  Ahaz of
Judah, however, remained adamant.  to cripple the Southern Kingdom
as an effective opponent or to force Ahaz into the anti-Assyrian
league, Pekah and Rezin invaded Judah and besieged Jerusalem (2
Kings 16:5; Isaiah 7:1-9).
<P>
 Reduced to dire extremity and ignoring the encouraging anouncement
of the impending doom of Damascus and Samaria, Ahaz dispatched
an embassy with tribute to summon the aid of Tiglathpileser (2
Kings 16:7-8).  In an inscription recroding the payment of tribute
by various vassal states of Syria-Palestine, including the kings
of Hamath, Arvad, Moba, Gaza, Ashklelon, Edom, and others, occurs
&quot;Iauhazi [Jehoahaz, i.e., Ahaz] of Judah.&quot;  Tribute
is mentioned as consisting of &quot;gold, silver, lead, iron,
tin, brightly colored woolen garments, linen, the purpole garments
of their lands...all kings of costly things, the products of the
sea and the dry land...the royal treasure, horses, mules, broken
to the yoke...&quot;
<P>
 Jehoahaz (&quot;The One Who Possesses Yahweh&quot;), the more
formal name employed by the Assyrians, was evidently considered
by the pious Judahites to be entirely inappropriate for so week
a character, noted for his idolatry.   Thus, they preferred to
refer to this wicked ruler simply as &quot;Ahaz&quot;, meaning
&quot;One Who Possesses&quot;).  Besides &quot;making his son
pass through the fire&quot;, and practicing other non-Jewish rites
(2 Kings 16:3-4), Ahaz's bent toward paganizm is illustrated by
his importation of the type of altar he saw when he went to pay
homage to Tiglathpileser at Damascus (2 Kings 16:10-16).
<P>
<B>Tiglathpileser III and the Fall of Damascus.</B>  Ahaz's plea
for aid against Israel and Damascus must have fitted in well with
Tiglathpileser's own ambitions in Syria-Palestine.  His response,
certainly dictated by perceived self-interest, took the form of
a campaign to Philistia in 734 BC.  It was a move evidently aimed
a splitting the allies, isolating Damascus, opening a way through
northern Israel to the coastal plain, and effecting contact with
Ahaz.
<P>
 In all probability it was on this expedition to the Philistine
plain that Tiglathpilesser III overran Israel, taking &quot;Ijon,
Abel-beth-maacha, Janoah, Kadesh, Hazor, Gilead, and Galilee --
all the land of Naphtali...&quot; (2 Kings 15:29), and deported
the inhabitants to Assyria.  However, the emperor's own record
of the event obviously including that of 734 BC, leaves the exact
date uncertain.  His claim is:
<P>
 <blockquote>...the wide land of Naphtali, in its entirety, I brought within
the border of Assyria.  My official I set over them as governor.</blockquote>
<P>
 Again, he says:
<P>
 <blockquote>The land of Bit-Humria (House of Omri)...all of its people, together
with their goods, I carried off to Assyria.</blockquote>
<P>
 Bit-Humria or &quot;House of Omri&quot; had been the common Assyrian
name for the country of Israel ever since the days of King Omri,
founder of a famous dynasty over a century previously.  Such a
wholesale deportation of peoples to prevent future uprisings was
a notorious feature of Tiglathpileser's administration.  On one
occasion he boasts of carrying off &quot;30,300 people...from
their cities&quot; and placing them in another province.  On another
occasion he speaks of displacing 1223 people.
<P>
 With Israel duly castigated by the loss of its northern territories,
Tiglathpileser now turned to Damascus to punish the other prominent
rebel, Rezin.  Events center there in the next two years (733-732
BC) when punitive military action is mentioned &quot;against the
land of Damascus&quot; in the Assyrian Eponym lists.
<P>
 Despite the mutilated and fragmentary condition of Tiglathpileser's
records dealing with the siege and fall of Damascus, the salient
facts stand out clearly.  The Assyrian achieved the overthrow
of the city and the Aramean state of which it was the capital,
a feat his predicessors had vainly tried to accomplish for more
than a half century.  The clash with Rezin clearly resulted in
the shattering of Aramean power.
<P>
 In the long siege of Damascus, of which little is known, for
not even Tiglathpileser's description of it is extant, King Panammu
of Samal, a loyal Syrian tributary of the Assyrian monarch, sacrificed
his life.  This fact supplies a hint of just how intense the struggle
was.  The city finally fel in 732 BC.  Making due allowance for
hyperbole on the part of the Assyrian records, the destruction
of the region around Damascus must have been horrendous.  Tiglathpileser
reports that five hundred ninety-one towns of the &quot;sixteen
districts of Aram I destroyed like mounds left by a flood.  Hadaru,
the father's house of Rezin of Aram [where] he was born, I besieged,
I captured.  Eight hundred people, together with their possessions...I
carried off.&quot;
<P>
 The concise but comprehensive biblical notice closely links the
fall of Damascus with Ahaz's appeal and payment of tribute to
Tiglathpileser.  &quot;And the king of Assyria listened to him...and
went up against Damascus and took it, and caried its people captive
to Kir, and killed Rezin&quot; (2 Kings 16:9).  The death of this
the last of the Aramean kings who ruled for almost two centuries
at Damascus was reported on a tablet of Tiglathpileser found and
read by one of the early pioneers in Assyriology, Sir Henry Rawlinson.
 Unfortunately, however, this important document was lost without
leaving a trace of its fate, when it was left behind in Asia.
 With Rezin's death the Aramaic kingdom of Damascus passed away
forever.
<P>
<B>Israel and the Triumph of Assyria</B>
<P>
 Tiglathpileser's far-reaching conquests and ruthless administration
made him master of all the Westland.  In a list of his western
tributaries he mentions among many otehrs the kings of Gebel (later
Byblus), and Arvad on the Mediterranean coast; the kings of Hamath,
Ammon, Moab, Ashkelon, &quot;Iauhazi [Jehoahaz] of Judah, Kaush-malaku
of Edom...[and] Hananu [Hannon] of Gaza.&quot;
<P>
 Tiglathpileser also controlled Israel.  When Pekah was assasinated,
the Assyrian emperor placed Hoshea on the throne (2 Kings 15:30),
obligating him to pay heavy tribute to Assyria.  This also was
duly recorded in the imperial inscriptions.  &quot;Paqaha [Pekah]
their king, they deposed and I placed Ausi' [Hoshea] over them
as king.  Ten talents of gold...talents of silver, as their tribute
I received from them and to Assyria I carried them.&quot;
<P>
<B>Shalmaneser V and the Siege of Samaria</B>
<P>
 Tiglathpileser III died in 727 BC and was succeeded by his son
Shalmaneser V (726-722 BC).  On a fragment of a small cylinder
in the British Museum is recorded the only text extant concerning
this particular monarch's reign.  At least it is an interesting
bit of writing.  The inscription is evidently a memorial cylander
placed in Nabu's temple at Borsippa in Babylonia to commemorate
Shalmaneser's restoration of the ediface afterit had been severely
damaged by flood.  &quot;...its damage I repared and strengthened
its structure.&quot;
<P>
 In the Old Testament, on the other hand, there are two prominent
references to Shalmaneser V and to the part he played in the final
overthrow of Samaria during the reign of Hoshea.  The first recounts
that &quot;Shalmaneser king of Assyria,&quot; after imprisoning
Hoshea for conspiracy with So [Sibe], a petty king on the eastern
frontier of the Delta, &quot;went up to Samaria and besieged it
three years&quot; (2 Kings 17:3-6).
<P>
 The second Biblical notice connects the beginning of Shalmaneser's
siege of Samaria with the fourth year of Hezekiah's reign in Judah.
 &quot;And at the end of three years they [the Assyrian] took
it [the city]....And the king of Assyria carried Israel away unto
Assyria, and put them in Halah, and on the Habor, the river of
Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes&quot; (2 Kings 18:9-11).
 It is noteworthy that neither of these two passages states that
Shalmaneser himself actually took the city, since it was actually
taken by his successor.
<P>
<B>Sargon II and the Collapse of Samaria</B>
<P>
 Israel's capital-fortress held out stubbornly for three years
under the relentless pressure of Assyrian arms.  Before the overthrow
was actually accomplished, Shalmaneser V had been succeeded on
the throne of Assyria by Sharrukin II (721-705 BC), an usurper
and a general in the army, who assumed the ancient and venerable
name of Sargon (Sargon of Agade, founder of the great Semitic
empire in Babylonia in the twenty-fourth century BC).  Mention
of Sargon II in Isaiah 20:1 in connection with his capture of
Ashdod, an event recorded in his annals, was, until the advent
of modern archeology, the only place in extant literature where
hisname was known.
<P>
 Now, of course, thanks to the work of Paul Emile Botta (and others),
the French consular agent at Mosul, who discovered Sargon's palace
at Khorsabad (Dur-Sharrukin or &quot;Sargonsburg&quot;) in 1843,
and more recent explorations at the site by the Oriental Institute
of the University of Chicago, Sargon II is one of the best known
of Assyrian emperors.  In the Khorsabad annals of his regim, the
monarch lists the fall of Samaria as the outstanding event of
the first year of his reign:
<P>
 <blockquote>At the beginning of my rule, in my first year of reign....the
people of Samaria...27,290...who lived therein, I carried away...</blockquote>
<P>
 In Sargon's so-called &quot;Display Inscription&quot; at Khorsabad,
which summarizes the principal events of the first 15 years of
his reign, he says:
<P>
<blockquote> I besieged and captured Samaria, carrying off 27,290 of its inhabitants.
 I gathered 50 chariots from among them. I replaced the deported
inhabitants with new imigrants.  Finally, I set my officers over
them and imposed upon them the tribute of the former king.</blockquote>
<P>
 With the fall of Samaria the Northern Kingdom came to an abrupt
end.  Assyria was triumphant in the Westland.
