<B>The Book of 1 John</B> 
<P>
<B>I. Title</B> 
<P>
The title comes from the name of the author; 1 John is the first
of three letters ascribed to the apostle.
<P>
<B>II. Author and Setting</B> 
<P>
The author never identifies himself in the letter. Traditions
that were uncontested from about the third century until the eighteenth
century identified the apostle John as the author of 1 John, identified
Asia as the site of its publication, and identified Cerinthianism
as the heresy that the author was combating.
<P>
Cerinthus, according to Irenaeus:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
represented Jesus as having not been born of a virgin, but as
being the son of Joseph and Mary according to the ordinary course
of human generation, while he nevertheless was more righteous,
prudent and wise than other men. Moreover, after his baptism,
Christ descended upon him in the form of a dove from the Supreme
Ruler, and that then he proclaimed the unknown Father, and performed
miracles. But at last Christ departed from Jesus, and that then
Jesus suffered and rose again, while Christ remained impassible,
inasmuch as he was a spiritual being. (Irenaeus, <I>Contra Hereses</I>
3.4)

Glenn W. Barker presents an interesting alternative theory:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
At this point Dodd's theory provides some help. He sees the root
of the problem in the confrontation of Christianity with the &quot;evangelistic
and pietistic religious movement&quot; developing within the &quot;higher
paganism&quot; characteristic of the Hellenistic world but especially
present in Asia. When the missionaries of the Christian faith
first came into contact with the representatives of these movements,
they undoubtedly received, at least initially, a warm welcome.
The eclectic character of these advocates of &quot;higher paganism&quot;
would make sure that they would be prepared &quot;to adopt Christianity
as they had already tried to adopt Judaism&quot; (pp. xvi-xvii).
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
As Dodd shows, the Johannine community already reflected some
of the language style of this world. He believes therefore that
one could expect the Johannine community to be unusually successful
in its missionary effort among such persons. Converts from this
particular milieu would inevitably bring philosophical and religious
verbiage with them into the community that would require an extensive
theological response by the teachers. The Gospel of John may in
itself represent not only a missionary document for these persons
but some response to the questions raised by the converts. Inevitably,
however, a significant number of the faithful would prove vulnerable
to pagan reinterpretation that borrowed from Christian categories.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
In his First Epistle John seems to recognize this pull and seeks
to help those trying not to fall back into non-Christian speculation.
On the other hand, as Dodd points out, the community would inevitably
contain some &quot;enthusiastic but ill-informed converts to Christianity,&quot;
would be eager to reinterpret their new found faith &quot;in terms
of modern thought&quot; (ibid., p. xvii). The false teachers who
previously had been in the community and had then departed, proving
that they had not really belonged to the community, may well have
been representatives of such a movement. They would be presenting
themselves as preserving the best of both traditions.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Furthermore, the false teachers' motive, at least in the beginning,
may have been prompted by the desire to translate the gospel into
the terms of another culture. Their enthusiasm would likely blind
them to the fact that their reinterpretation would ultimately
lead to the dissolution of what was central to the Christian faith:
Jesus as the Son of God through whose death the bonds of sin had
finally been destroyed. If this reconstruction is valid, it would
help explain why these new &quot;false teachers&quot; had such
a strong position in the community. Originally they had belonged
to those who had been most involved in the missionary activity
of the community. That they no longer were true to the faith and
were to be classed as antichrists would certainly be hard for
some of the community to accept. (Glenn W. Barker. &quot;1 John&quot;

Dating 1 John is difficult, though a date between AD 85 and 90
seems probable.
