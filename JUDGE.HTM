<B><H1>The Judges</H1></B>
<P>
 The era of the Judges which extends from the death of Joshua
to the time of Saul and the establishment of the Monarachy, was
a time of disorder and apostacy.  The anarchic conditions which
to a large extent prevailed, are emphasized in the scriptural
narrative.  &quot;In those days there was no king in Israel: every
man did that which was right in his own eyes.&quot; (Judges 17:6,
21:25).  Canaanite idolatry, which the conquering Israelites failed
to extirpate completely, proved a continual snare, as Moses and
Joshua had solemnly forewarned.  The people accordingly frequently
lapsed into paganism, and worship at the central sanctuary, where
the ark was, was rendered difficult by the distracted state of
the country.
<P>
 During this long period when the tribes were divinely raised
up and empowered to free the oppressed Israelites, when deaprture
from Mosaic Yahwism led to the chastisement of the poeple in the
form of domination by some invading foreign power, these so-called
charismatic or specially endoed deliverers arose.  They were called
&quot;judges&quot; (Hebrew: <I>shophetim</I>).  The name <I>shophet</I>
or &quot;judge&quot;, is an old Canaaite word, found among the
later Carthaginians in the sense of &quot;magistrate&quot;, called
in Latin <I>sufes</I> (pl. <I>sufetes</I>), and corresponding
to the Roman consul.  Having freed the nation or fpart of the
nation and thereby having demonstrated his call by God, the deliverer
ws looked to be the people as the champion of their legal and
political rights.
<P>
 The roster of Judges number twelve, exclusive of Abimelech, Gideon's
son, who was a minor king.  It is clear from the biblical narrative
that the judges did not constitute an unbroken line of rulers,
but appeared sporadically, as occasion arose.  Moreover, they
were often only local heroes, performing exploits in restricted
districts or certain tribes.  It is certain also taht some ruled
simultaneously in different parts of the country (the later the
dating of the Exodus, the more overlapping that is required).
<P>
<B> The Chronology of the Period</B>
<P>
 The date allocated to the Judges is, of course, dependent upon
the date assigned to the Exodus from Egypt and the Conquest of
Palestine (note how everything builds on everything else!)  Following
an early date of around 1441 BC for the Exodus and 1401 BC for
the fall of Jericho, and allowing thirty years for Joshua and
ten years for the elders who outlived him, the period of the Judges
would have extended from about 1361 to around 1020 BC, the time
of Saul. Notice how undertain and problematical these dates are;
if the late date is correct for the Exodus and Conquest, then
everything shifts about 150 years later.  Most scholars would
argue strenuously for this later dating, though others are just
as strenuous the other way.  The majority hold to a late date,
however.  My preference for the early date is the minority viewpoint.
 Thus, the late date for the Exodus would place the time of the
Judges from about 1200 BC to about 1020 BC -- the terminus is
the same, because dates for the Monarchy are reasonably well established.
<P>
 The latter dating, although considered inescapable in the light
of certain interpretations of certain archeological findings,
is nevertheless fraught with grave problems and much confusion.
 On the surface, at least, it seems to conflict with the time
scheme of the earlier period, from Abraham to Moses, and also
necessitates telescoping the era of the Judges into a very short
time frame.
<P>
<B> Chronological Notices in the Biblical Account</B>
<P>
 Although the numerous indications of time which are found in
the Book of Judges do not permit this period of Israelite history
to be dated by this medium, a careful collection of the various
chronological elements found in the book and a comparison with
other pertinent chronological elements in other books of the OT
show that the time scheme underlying the biblical narrative is
consistent with an early (1441 BC) date for the Exodus and in
keeping with 1 Kings 6:1, according to which the 4th year of Solomon,
in which he began building the temple, was 480 years after the
Israelites left Egypt.  However, this underlying plan of the Book
of Judges can be made to fit a late-date scenario by assuming
overlaps and concurrent reigns among the Judges.
<P>
 Chronological notices dealing with the length of the various
oppresions, judgeships and periods of peace as given in the Book
of Judges run in this way:
<P>
<blockquote>1. Israel serves Cushan-Rishathaim 8 years (3:8)
<P>
 <blockquote>a. deliverence comes through Othniel and the land is peaceful
for 40 years (3:11)</blockquote>
<P>
2. Israel is enslaved by Eglon of Moab for 18 years (3:14)
<P>
<blockquote>a. deliverence comes through Ehud and the land is peaceful for
80 years (3:30)</blockquote>
<P>
3. Jabin of Canaanite Hazor oppresses for 20 years (4:3)
<P>
 <blockquote>a. deliverence comes through Deborah and the land is peaceful
for 40 years (4-5)</blockquote>
<P>
4. Israel is oppressed by the Midianites for 7 years (6:1)
<P>
 <blockquote>a. deliverence comes through Gideon (Jerub-Baal) and the land
is peaceful for 40 years (8:28)</blockquote>
<P>
5. Abimelech reigns as a minor king for 3 years (9:22)
<P>
6. Tola judges Israel for 23 years (10:2)
<P>
7. Jair judges Israel for 22 years (10:3)
<P>
8. Israel (Transjordan) is oppressed by the Ammonites for 18 years
(10:8)
<P>
<blockquote>a. deliverence comes through Jephthah for 6 years</blockquote>
<P>
9. Ibzan judges Israel for 7 years (12:9)
<P>
10. Elong judges Israel for 10 years (12:11)
<P>
11. Abdon judges Israel for 8 years (12:14)
<P>
12. Israel is oppressed by the Philistines for 40 years (13:1)
<P>
 <blockquote>a. deliverence comes through Samson, who judges for 20 years
(15:20; 16:31)</blockquote></blockquote>
<P>
 If the total of these figures is computed, 410 years is the resulting
length of the period of the Judges if they came one after the
other, with no overlapping.  But this is too long an interval
whether the Exodus is placed early or late, since the time period
for the Judges is at most 341 years and may be as short as 180
years.
<P>
 The solution to the problem is obvious.  Individual judges, like
Shamgar, who has no chronological ntotation connected with his
name (3:31), Tola (10:2), Jair (10:3), Ibzan (12:9), Elon (12:11),
Abdon (12:14) who are listed in the barest possible manner without
any detail and perhaps others whose careers are described more
fully were merely local chieftains whose activity was strictly
confined to some limited district and who could have ruled simultaneously
with other Judges.  For instance, the period of the Ammonite oppression
(18 years) was confined to the Transjordan and could easily have
overlapped the era of Philistine aggression during Samson's 20
years (15:20 and 16:31).
<P>
<B> General Chronological Notice in the Biblical Account</B>
<P>
 In addition to these detailed chronological elements a very important
general notation of time occures which gives the extent of the
period from Israel's sojourn at Heshbon, shortly before the invasion
of Canaan, to about the second year of Jephtha's judgeship, as
300 years.  The words are those of Jephthah to the encroaching
Ammonites: &quot;While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and her towns and
in Aroer and her towns and in all the cities that are along by
the side of the Arnon, three hundred years, wherefore you did
not  recover them within that time .&quot; (Judges 11:26)
<P>
 Examination of Numbers 21:25 discloses that the sojourn at Heshbon
preceded Joshua's appointment by a year or two at the most.  If
then, 40 years are allowed for Joshua and the period of the elders,
8 years for Cushan-Rishathaim's oppression (3:8); 40 years for
Othniel's deliverance and era of peace (3:11); 18 years for Eglon's
oppression (3:14), 80 years for Ehud's deliverance and an extended
quiet period (3:30); 20 years for Jabin's oppression (4:3); 40
years for Deborah and a peaceful interval (5:31); 7 years for
the Midianite oppression (6:1); 40 years for Gideon's judgeship
(8:28); 3 years for Abimelech (9:22) and 1 year for the Ammonite
oppression at the time of Jephthah, a total of 297 years is reached,
which accords well with the 300 years specified in Judges 11:26.
<P>
 It is quite evident, moreover, that Judges 11:26 is in general
agreement with the time scheme underlying Joshua-Judges, also
with the 480 years of the Masoretic Text of 1 Kings 6:1 and the
early date for the Exodus (1441 BC).  If the computation is carreid
forward to Solomon's 4th year, this fact becoems apparent.  Allowing
5 years for the remainder of Jephtha's judgeship (12:7); 40 years
for Samson and the Philistines (13:1, 15:20); 20 years for the
judgeship of Eli (cf. 1 Samuel 4:18 which has 40 years where the
LXX has 20 years, the difference being attributed to the period
of Philistine domination); 20 years for Samuel (1 Sam. 7:2, 3);
15 years (estimated) for Saul; 40 years for David (1 Kings 2:11);
and 4 years for Solomon (1 Kings 6:1), these figures approximate
144 years.  When this period is added to the 38 years from the
Exodus to Heshbon and the 300 years from Heshbon to Jephtha, a
total period of 482 years from the Exodus to Solomon's 4th year
is the result, as against the 480 years of 1 Kings 6:1.  Not bad;
but notice all the assumptions inherent in these figures, not
the least being the unknown term of Saul's reign.  If we were
to go with the late date, we would have to juggle the figures
differently, and it could be (and has been) done.
<P>
<B> The Events of the Period Fixed in the Chronology</B>
<P>
 In placing the era of the Judges (including Joshua and the period
of the elders) from about 1401 to 1020 BC it is possible to fit
the events recorded in the book of Joshua and the book of Judges
into the broad contemporary historical scene without strain, wholesale
rejection of chronological notices, or general telescoping of
the biblical perspective, as must inevitably be the case under
the late date theories of the Exodus.  Allocation of specific
events in the framework of extra-biblical history, however, by
the nature of the data available must be only approximate and
to some extent tentative.  On the other hand, such a setting down
of events in sequence is valuable in demonstrating the chronological
consistency of the biblical account and in furnishing proper perspective
for the entire era.
<P>
1. Era of Joshua (30 years) and the Elders (10 years).  <I>Circa
1401-1361 BC</I>.
<P>
 The important events of this period are the invasion of Canaan
with the fall of Jericho, Ai, the defeat of the Jerusalem League
with conquests in south and north Palestine, and the settlement
of the tribes.  In Egypt Amenhotep III (c. 1412-1375) was apathetic
and aging and content to leave Syrian affairs under the management
of vassals and under his son Amenophis IV -- also called Akhenaton
(c. 1387-1366 [or 1353-36], coregency).  The Egyptian Empire in
Syria-Palestine was temporarily lost, and the country fell away
to the Habiru, as the Amarna letters indicate.  The second half
of the period coincides with the advance of the Hittites from
the north, which helped to neutralize Egyptian influence.
<P>
2. Oppression by Cushan-Rishathaim for Eight Years (c. 1361-1353
BC)
<P>
 This is the invasion by an obscure Hittite conqueror, who, having
annexed Mesopotamia (Mitanni) penetrated southward and entered
Palestine (Judges 3:7-10), leaving traces at Bethshan, which commanded
the western gateway to the Valley of Jezreel and elsewhere.  The
event falls within the latter part of the reign of Tutankhamun
(c. 1366-1357 BC) and the first years of the regime of his general
Harmhab, who eventually ruled (c. 1350-1314 BC) for an extended
period when Egyptian influence in Palestine was negligible.
<P>
3. Deliverance by Othniel and the Period of Peace for 40 Years
(c. 1353-1313 BC)
<P>
 In Egypt Harmhab established firm authority, reorganized the
government, and effectually maintained Egyptian supremacy, so
that political stability was possible in Palestine (Judges 3:11).
<P>
 Othniel was a Kenizzite, brother (or perhaps nephew) of Caleb
ben Jephunneh (Judges 1:13; cf. Josh. 15:17); if &quot;son of
Kenaz&quot; is a patronymic, he and Caleb may have been brothers
or half-brothers.  He distinguished himself in the sack of Kiriath-sepher,
and married Achsah, Caleb's daughter.  Later he saw the beginnings
of apostacy and the domination of the Cushan-rishathaim, against
whom he led a successful revolt, becoming the first of the Judges.
 He restored order and authority (when he says he &quot;judged&quot;,
it has this idea as well as the idea of &quot;deliverance&quot;).
<P>
4. Oppression by Eglon of Moab for 18 years (c. 1313-1295 BC)
<P>
 This event falls mainly in the reign of Seti I (c. 1314-1295
BC) and synchronizes with a coalition among Asiatic Bedouins,
who were reported to be gaining a foothold in Palestine.  Following
these disturbances punitive expeditions visited Accho on the Phoenician
coast, Bethshan in western Esdraelon near the Jordan, as far north
as Hamath on the Orontes and eastward to Pahel (Fahil) beyond
the Jordan, restoring order.
<P>
5. Era of Peace After Ehud for 80 years (c. 1295-1215 BC)
<P>
 This period (cf. Judges 3:12-30) comprises the latter part of
the reign of Seti I, who re-established order in Transjordan and
Palestine, and covers completely the long reign of Raamses II
(c. 1295-1223 BC).  This latter great Pharoah maintained his authority
in southern Syria by treaty with the Hittites and effective administration.
 His son and successor Merneptah was already advanced in age when
he came to the throne.  There was a minor revolt in Palestine
which he put down with little difficulty.  It is commemorated
by a song of victory in which the Pharaoh's power is eulogized
and the boast is made that &quot;Israel is laid waste and has
no seed.&quot;  This is the only reference to the actual name
of Israel in any Egyptian inscription.
<P>
 The portion of the ode which mentions Israel runs as follows:
<P>
<blockquote> The princes are prostrate, while they say &quot;peace!&quot;
<br>
 There is no one who raises his head among the Nine Bows.
<br>
 Libya is ruined, Khatti is pacified;
<br>
 The Canaanite land is despoiled with every evil.
<br>
 Ashqelon is carried captive, Gezer is conquered; 
<br>
 Yanoam is made as though it did not exist.
<br>
 The people of Israel are desolate, it has no offspring:
<br>
 Palestine [Khuru] has become a widow for Egypt.
<br>
 All lands are united, they are pacified;
<br>
 Everyone that is turbulent is bound by king Merneptah,
<br>
 Given life like Re, every day.</blockquote>
<P>
 Ehud was a Benjaminite.  He was the son of Gera, and he led the
revolt against the Moabite occupation of east Benjamine (Judges
3).  Gaining a private audience of King Eglon, he killed him in
his own apartments (graphically described; much is made of Eglon's
obesity), and rallied the Israelites to take advantage of the
confusion into which the Moabites were thrown.  His left-handedness
was doubtless useful in taking Eglon unawares.
<P>
6. Oppression by Jabin for 20 Years (c. 1215-1195 BC)
<P>
 After Merneptah a series of ephemeral kinglets on the throne
of Egypt were too weak to maintain a powerful state.  Among these
were Amenmose, Siptah and Seti II.  Around 1200 BC civil war developed.
 The period was ideal for Jabin, king of Hazor, the capital of
a Canaanite kingdom in North Palestine, identified by J. Garstang
with El Kedah, 4 miles west from the foot of Lake Huleh (which
no longer exists: it was a malarial infested swamp, for all practical
purposes and so the Israeli government many years ago drained
it [during a time when swamps were considered bad things instead
of good things that we now call wetlands].  Now all that is left
of it is some exceptionally rich farm land and some fish breeding
ponds) and the Jordan, to overrun some of the tribes of Israel
(Judges 4:1-24).
<P>
7. Deliverance by Deborah and Era of Peace for 40 years (1195-1155
BC)
<P>
 Around 1200 BC a new dynasty was founded in Egypt and Raameses
III (c. 1198-1167 BC), son of the founder, was a strong king who
maintained order in Asia and made possible a period of stability
in Palestine under a leader like Deborah.
<P>
 According to Judges 4:4ff Deborah had her headquarters under
&quot;the palm tree of Deborah&quot; between Ramah and Bethel,
and was consulted there by Israelites from various tribes who
wished to have their disputes settled -- either disputes which
proved too intractable for their local judges or intertribal disputes.
 She was thus a judge in the ordinary, non-military sense of the
word, and it was probably because of her judicial and charismatic
renoun that the Israelites had recourse to her in the straits
to which they had been reduced unders Sisera's oppression.  She
commanded Barak to take the field as Israelite commander-in-chief
against Sisera, although he was in fact more the wimp-in-chief
than anything else.  He consented to lead only on the condition
that she come with him.  She concented, and the result of this
collaboration was the crushing defeat of Sisera at the battle
of Kishon (Judges 4:14, 5:19ff).
<P>
 She is called (Judges 4:4) the wife of Lappidoth (lit. torches),
and she is described (Judges 5:7) as a &quot;mother in Israel.&quot;
 It has been argued that this last phrase means &quot;a metropolis
in Israel&quot; (cf. 2 Sam. 20:19), and that the reference is
to the city of Daberath (Josh. 21:28, 1 Chron. 6:72), modern Deburiyeh
at the western foot of Mt. Tabor; but there is nothing in the
narrative or in the poem to prepare us for the prominence which
would thus suddenly be given to such an obscure place.
<P>
 The song of Deborah (Judges 5:2-31a) has been preserved from
the 12th century BC with its language practically unmodernized
by the scribes, and is thus one of the most archaic passages in
the OT (the Song of Moses is older).  It was evidently composed
on the morrow of the victory which it celebrates, and is an important
source of information on tribal relations in Israel at the time.
 It may be divided into eight sections: an introduction of praise
(vv. 2-3); the invocation of Yahweh (4-5); the desolation under
the oppressors (6-8); the mustering of the tribes (9-18); the
battle of Kishon (19-23); the death of Sisera (24-27); the description
of Sisera's mother awaiting his return (28-30); and the epilogue
(31).  It is from the song, rather than from the prose narrative
of chapter 4 that we learn what precisely brought about Sisera's
defeat: a cloudburst flooded the watercourse of Kishon and swept
away the Canaanite chariotry (21), throwing the army into confusion
and making it an easy prey for the men of Deborah and Barak. 
<P>
 The vivid and moving description of Sisera's mother (28ff) has
been felt to confirm the feminine authorship of the song.
<P>
8. Oppression by the Midianites for Seven Years (c. 1155-1148
BC)
<P>
 Decline in Egyptian power under his successors Raamses IV and
V followed the reign of Raamses III.  This period of Egyptian
weakness was ideal for the erruption of desert Bedouins such as
the camel-riding, tent-dwelling Midianites, who pressed into the
Valley of Jezreel and overran the country in the days of Gideon
(Judges 6 and 7).  Bethshan, which guarded the western entrance
to the Valley of Esdraelon, no longer presented an effective barrior
as a fortress, since no Egyptian garrison had been maintained
there since the reign of Rameses III.  Taking advantage of the
breakdown of Egyptian authority the invaders overflowed into the
fertile areas to the south, particularly around Ophrah, in the
territory of Manasseh.
<P>
9. Era of Peace Under Gideon (Jerub-Baal) for 40 years (c. 1148-1108
BC)
<P>
 The decline of Egyptian power with the loss of its stabilizing
influence in Palestine now begins to find expression in the growing
need for a kingship.
<P>
 The name &quot;Gideon&quot; means &quot;hewer&quot; or &quot;smiter&quot;.
 He was the son of Joash, of the clan of Abiezer, of the tribe
of Manasseh, and he was also called Jerubbaal.  Some scholars
hold that the narrative in Judges which discusses him is composite,
 made up of at least two accounts (based on the use of two names).
<P>
 Gideon was called to deliver his people while threshing wheat
secretly for fear of Midianite depredations.  There followed an
act of defiance in which he destroyed his father's Baal altar
and Asherah, from the consequences of which he was saved by Joash's
quick-wittedness (if Baal is such a great god, he can take care
of himself).  The gesture of defiance seems to signify a protest
against the assimilation of the worship of Yahweh with the Baal-cult.
 This act is associated with the giving to Gideon of the name
Jerubbaal (<I>yerubba'al</I>), which is variously interpreted
as &quot;Baal strives&quot;, &quot;Baal founds&quot; or &quot;may
Baal give increase&quot;.  Some suggest that this may have been
Gideon's earliest name, reflecting the prevailing syncretism,
receiving however, a new significance in view of this act of iconoclasm.
 In 2 Samuel 11:21 the name appears as Jerubesheth (<I>yerubbeshet</I>),
replacing the abhorred name Baal with the word for &quot;shame&quot;,
a standard practice among the later scribes.
<P>
 The defeat of the Mideanites is graphically described in Judges
7, when at God's command Gideon reduced his army from 32,000 to
300 and received personal reassurance during a secret reconnaisance
when he heard a Midianite warrior's dream of defeat. He made a
sudden night attack which demoralized the enemy and led to a thorough
rout.  Judges 8 records the completion of the victory with the
slaying of Zebah and Zalmunna, despite the hostility of the towns
of Succoth and Penuel, for which Gideon exacted punishment.
<P>
 After the deliverance Gideon was asked to set up a hereditary
monarch, but he refused.  He did, however, accept the golden earrings
taken as spoil in battle, with which he made an &quot;ephod&quot;
(some speculate that this was an image of Yahweh; an ephod is
usually described as  an ornate vestment of the Jewish high priest
consisting of a garment like an apron suspended from the shoulders
and fastened with a band).  This he set up in his own city, where
it later became a source of apostasy.
<P>
 The defeat of Midian was decisive, and Israel had peace during
the remainder of Gideon's life.  The final picture of Gideon is
of a peaceful old age, with many wives and sons, among the latter
being the notorious Abimelech (Judges 9).
<P>
 Hebrews 11:32 gives Gideon a place among the heroes of faith.
 He trusted God rather than in a large army, gaining a victory
with a handful of men which made it clear it was wholly of God.
 &quot;The day of Midian&quot; seems to have become proverbial
for deliverance by God without the aid of man (Isaiah 11:4). 
Gideon is portrayed as a humble man, and his refusal of the kingship
establishes the fact that Israel's ideal government was a theocracy
(Judges 8:23).
<P>
<B>Peoples Mentioned in Judges 6-8</B>
<P>
<I><B> Midianites</B></I>
<P>
 The Midianites consisted of five families, linked to Abraham
through Midian, son of the concubine Keturah.  Abraham sent them
away, with all his other sons by concubines, into the East, according
to Genesis 25:1-6.  Thus, the Midianites are found inhabiting
desert borders in Transjordan from Moab down past Edom.
<P>
 They were desert-dwellers associated with Ishmaelites and Medanites
(Gen. 37:28, 36) when Joseph was sold into Egypt; for the partial
overlap of these terms we can look at Judges 8:24 where the Midianites
defeated by Gideon are said to have been Ishmaelites because of
their use of gold ear or nose rings.  Moses had a Midianite wife,
Zipporah, father-in-law, jethro (or Reuel) according to Exodus
2:21, 3:1, etc. and a Midianite brother-in-law named Hobab (Numbers
10:29, Judges 4:11).  As a man of the desert, Hobab was asked
by Moses to guide Israel in traveling through the steppe or wilderness
(Numbers 10:29-32).
<P>
 Later, in the plains of Moab, the chiefs of Midian and Moab combined
in hiring Balaam to curse Israel (Numbers 22ff) and their people
led Israel into idolatry and immorality (Numbers 25), and so had
to be slaughtered (Numbers 25:16-18; 31).  The five princes of
Midian were confederates of the Amorite king Sihon (Joshua 13:21).
 In the time of the judges, through Gideon and his puny band (Judges
6-8, 9:17) God delivered Israel from the scourge of camel-riding
Midianites, Amalekites and other &quot;sons of the east&quot;,
an event remembered by psalmist and prophet (Ps. 83:9, and Isaiah
9:4, 10:26).  This at present is the earliest known reference
to full-scale use of camels in warfare, but by no lmeans the first
occurance of domesticated animals.
<P>
<I><B> Amalekites</B></I>
<P>
 Amalek (Heb. <I>amaleq</I>) was the son of Eliphaz and the grandson
of Esau (Gen. 36:12, and 16).  The name is used as a collective
noun for his descendants, the Amalekites (Ex. 17:8, Numbers 24:20,
Deut. 25:17, and Judges 3:13, and so on).
<P>
 Some writers distinguish the nomadic Amalekites normally found
in the Negev and Sinai area, from the descendants of Esau, becau;se
Gen. 14:7, which predates Esau, refers to &quot;the country of
the Amalekites.&quot;  The distinction is unnecessary if we regard
the phrase as being used to explain a location which would otherwise
be unknown to the people of Moses' time.
<P>
 Israel first met the Amalekites at Rephidim in the wilderness
of Sinai (Ex. 17:8-13, Deut. 25:17-18).  Because of this attack,
the Amalekites came under a permanent ban and were to be destroyed
(Deut. 25:19 and 1 Sam. 15:2-3).  On that occasion Aaron and Hur
held up Moses' hands and Israel prevailed.  A year later, after
the report of the spies, Israel ignored Moses' command and sought
to enter southern Canaan.  The Amalekites defeated them at Hormah
(Numbers 14:43, 45).
<P>
 From the days of the Judges two encounters are recored.  The
Amalekite assisted Eglon, king of Moab, to attack Israelite territory
(Judges 3:13), and later combined with the Midianites and the
sons of the east to raid Israeelite crops and flocks. Gideon drove
them out (Judges 6:3-5, 33; 7:12; 10:12).
<P>
 From the Exodus onwards, Amalekites were to be found in the Negev,
but for a time they gained a foothold in Ephraim (Judges 12:15).
 Balaam, the foreign prophet, looked away to their lands from
his vantage point in Moab, and described them as &quot;the first
of the nations&quot; (Numbers 24:20), which may mean in regard
either to origin or status (or, he might just have been sucking
up).
<P>
 Samuel commanded Saul to destroy the Amalekites in the area south
of Telaim.  booty was forbidden.  Saul pursued them from Havilah
to Shur but captured their king alive.  Later, Samuel slew Agag
and rebuked Saul (1 Sam. 15).
<P>
 David fought the Amalekites in the area of Ziklag which Achish,
king of Gath, had given him (1 Sam. 27:6, 30:1-20).  The Amalekites
declined later, and in Hezekiah's time the sons of Simeon attacked
&quot;the remnant of the Amalekites that had escaped&quot;, taking
their stronghold at Mt. Seir (1 Chron. 4:43).
<P>
<I><B> Amorites</B></I>
<P>
 A people of Canaan (Gen. 10:16) often listed with the Hittites,
Perizzites, etc., as opponents of Israel (Ex. 33:2).  They were
scattered throughout the hill country on either side of the Jordan
(Numbers 13:29).  Abraham had an alliance with the Amorites of
Hebron and, with their aid, routed the four kings who had attacked
the Dead Sea plain, including the Amorite town of Hazazon-tamar
(Gen. 14:5-7).  The name was also used as a general term for the
inhabitants of Canaan (Gen. 48:22, Josh. 24:15).  Ezekiel well
indicates the mixed population of the land of Canaan (caused largely
by continuous infiltrations from the eastern steppes), describing
Jerusalem as the offspring of Amorite and Hittite (Ezek. 16:3,
45).
<P>
 During the latter half of the third millennium BC, Sumerian and
Akkadian inscriptions refer to the Amorites (Sumerian <I>mar-tu</I>;
Akkadian <I>amurru</I>) as a desert people unaquainted with civilized
life, grain, houses, cities, or government.  Their headquarters
were in the mountain of Basar, probably Jebel Bishri north of
Palmyra.  About 2000 BC these people, who had been infiltrating
for centuries, moved into Babylonia in force.  they were partly
responsible for the collapse of the powerful Third Dynasty of
Ur and took over the rule of several towns (e.g. Larsa).  An Amorite
dynasty was established at Babylon, and its most powerful king,
Hammurappi, conquered the two other important &quot;Amorite&quot;
states of Assur and Mari (c. 1750 BC).  Amorites are traceable
by linguistic, mainly onomastic, evidence.  Such is not always
reliable or conclusive, but these dynasties were clearly of western
origin, Hammurappi's being termed Amorite in a contemporary text.
 The 20,000 texts found at Mari are mostly written in Akkadian
with many West Semitic features.  Personal name forms common in
these texts show that the names of the patriarchs followed well-known
styles.  The Mari texts give information about nomadic tribes
in Syria, notably the Mare-Yamina (or possibly Bene-Yamina) connected
with the area of Mt. Basar.  Another group had settled in the
Lebanon and engaged in the trading of horses.  This kingdom survived
into the period of the Amarna letters and the 19th Dyunasty of
Egypt when tribute is recorded from the state of Amor.  The capital
of this seems to have been the port of Sumur (modern Tell Kazel)
south of Arvad.  This is the country mentioned in Joshua 13:4.
<P>
 The general unrest of the years c. 2100 to c. 1800 BC both in
Mesopotamia and in Palestine was closely connected with increased
Amorite movement.  The break in occupation of several Palestinian
cities between the Early and Middle Bronze Age was caused by an
influx of nomadic folk who left many graves behind them, but little
trace of buildings. The pottery of these people has clear affinities
with pottery from Syria, which may indicate that they were related
&quot;Amorites.&quot;  The journeys of Abraham may be associated
with the latter part of this period.
<P>
 At the time of the Israelite invasion of Palestine, Amorite kings
(Sihon of Heshbon and Og of Bashan) ruled most of Transjordan
(Joshua 12:1-6; Judges 1:36).  The conquest of these two kings
was the first stage of the possession of the Promised Land and
was looked upon as a very important event in Israel's history
(Amos 2:9; Psalms 135:11, 136:19).  Gad, Reuben and half of Manesseh
occupied this territory (Numbers 32:33), and it later formed one
of the 12 regions supporting Solomon's court (1 Kings 4:19). 
The men of Ai are called Amorites (Josh. 7:7) and Jerusalem, Hebron,
Jarmuth, Lachish, and Eglon were Amorite principalities which
Israel overcame (Joshua 10:1-27).  Northern Amorites aided the
king of Hazor (Joshua 11:1-14).  After the land was settled, the
Amorites became menials and were gradually absorbed (1 Kings 9:20).
 Their evil memory remained, providing comparison for the idolatry
of Ahab and Manasseh (1 Kings 21:26; 2 Kings 21:11.  See also
Gen. 15:16).
<P>
 Invasions of other peoples, the Kassites, Hurrians, and Indo-Europeans
in Mesopotamia, the Israelites in Palestine and the Aramean in
Syria weakened the Amorites as a power by 1000 BC.  The name survived
in Akkadian as a designation for Syria-Palestine until superseded
by Hatti (Hittite); it was also a general word for &quot;west.&quot;
<P>
<I><B> Abiezrite</B></I>
<P>
 Also just Abiezer (Hebrew <I>abi'ezer</I>: &quot;father of help&quot;
or &quot;my father is help&quot;, depending on whether the i is
taken as a genetive ending or as a pronominal suffix).  It was
a clan (subtribe within a tribe) of Manasseh (Joshua 17:2) of
which Gideon was a member (Judges 6:11).  In Gideon's time the
clan was centered in Ophrah (Judges 6:11, 24), probably to be
identified with al-Tayibeh, north of Beth-shean.
<P>
<B>Gideon, Mighty Warrior (Judges 6:12)</B>
<P>
I. His Early Life and surroundings
<P>
 A. He was the son of Joash, of the tribe of Manasseh (Judges
6:11)
<P>
 B. In his day, Israel had forsaken God and was in a weak condition,
terrorized by the Mideonite robbers who pillaged the country and
made life intolerable (Judges 6:1-5).  A thing to keep in mind
about this pattern: it was promissed to the Israelites that if
they obeyed God and kept his commandments, then all would go well
with them.  If they rebelled and ignored God's commandments, then
they would suffer.  The foundation of the OT is laid on Genesis-Deuteronomy,
and the cornerstone of that foundation is Deuteronomy.  One cannot
understand the activities in Israel's history, or the wisdom books,
or the books of prophesy if one ignores Deuteronomy.  All the
good things and all the bad things that happened to Israel were
promissed to her in this book, which quite simply is the contract
between God and the nation Israel (see Deut. 28:1-7, 15-25).
<P>
 C. As so often in times of distress, Israel repented and &quot;cried
out to the Lord.&quot; (Judges 6:6)
<P>
 D. A prophet was sent to rebuke the sinful people (Judges 6:7-10)
<P>
II. Gideon's Call to Deliver the People
<P>
<blockquote> A. An angel (messenger) appeared and summoned him to leadership
(Judges 6:11-12)
<P>
 B. Gideon, Like Moses, Offers Excuses
<P>
 <blockquote> 1. The Lord has forsaken Israel (Judges 6:13)
<P>
  2. I'm a wimp (unfitness for the task).  False humility (Judges
6:15).  Lesson: don't be afraid to do what God has asked you to
do (cf. Deut. 1:27-28 and the result, Deut. 1:29-36; see also
Deut. 9:1-3).</blockquote>
<P>
 C. He is assured of the divine presence and of the certainty
of success and he is given a supernatural sign to encourage his
faith (Judges 6:16-21).</blockquote>
<P>
III. The Battle with the Midianites
<P>
 This was the &quot;outstanding&quot; period of Gideon's life.
<P>
<blockquote> A. Events leading up to the battle.
<P>
  <blockquote>1. Gideon destroys the Baal altar and the Asherah pole and then
builds an altar to God (Judges 6:24-28).
<P>
  2. He is threatened with death by the idolators but is rescued
by his father (this is when his other name, Jerubbaal, is given)
<P>
  3. After assembling the enemies, Gideon blows a trumpet and
calls Israel together (Judges 6:33-35)</blockquote>
<P>
 B. Two encouragements and a severe test come to Gideon before
he attacks the enemy
<P>
  <blockquote>1. His faith is strengthened by the sign of the fleece (Judges
6:36-40)
<P>
  2. His faith is severely tested by the reduction of his army
from 32,000 to 300 (Judges 7:2-8; the reason for the reduction
is given in verse 2.  Cf. Deut. 7:7, 9:4-6).
<P>
  3. He visits the enemy camp and is greatly encouraged by overhearing
one of the Midianites relate a dream to his fellow soldier (Judges
7:9-14).</blockquote></blockquote>
<P>
IV. The Victory
<P>
 <blockquote>A. The unique plan of attack (Judges 7:15-18)
<P>
 B. The overwhelming defeat of the Midianites (Judges 7:19-8:21)</blockquote>
<P>
V. Subsequent Events in Gideon's Career
<P>
 <blockquote>A. He is offered the crown of Israel and refuses it (Judges 8:22-23)
<P>
 B. He makes a golden ephod which becomes a snare to Israel, leading
them into idolatry (Judges 8:24-27).  It would appear that this
was actually an idol rather than an ordinary ephod, since it weighed
17,000 shekels -- that is, about 425 pounds.
<P>
 C. He judges Israel for 40 years (Judges 8:22-23)
<P>
 D. He dies at an old age (Judges 8:32)</blockquote>
<P>
10. Abimelech King at Shechem for 3 years (c. 1108-1105 BC)
<P>
 The son of Gideon by a concubine, Abimelech in the region of
Shechem attempted to secure succession to the unique position
held by his father Gideon (Judges 9).  Shechem was loacted in
the pleasant valley between Mt. Ebal and Mt. Gerizim at the site
of modern Nablus.  It was protected by a fortified tower, the
tower of Shechem, which Abimelech destroyed.  The would-be king
came to an early end, and his influence could hardly have extended
much beyond the western part of Manasseh.
<P>
 Abimelech was not a nice man.  With the aid of his mother's family
he murdered all 70 of his brothers, with the exception of Jotham.
 Although he proclaimed hismelf &quot;king&quot; -- a title his
father had repudiated (8:23) -- his territory cannot have extended
beyond western Manasseh.  After three years the Shechemites turned
against their king.  Abimelech responded vigorously and cruelly.
 He later died somewhat ingloriously while besieging Thebez (Judges
9:50-57).
<P>
11. Oppression by the Ammonites (c. 1105 BC) and Jephthah's Judgeship
for Six Years (c. 1105-1099 BC)
<P>
 The oppression of Israel began in the Transjordan, in which region
the Ammonites oppressed the Israelites for 18 years (Judges 10:8).
 This period overlaps in the chronology, and only at the end,
perhaps around 1105 BC did the Ammonites cross the Jordan to harass
all of Israel. The period of national oppression, accordingly,
lasted only a single year, being terminated apparently in the
second year of Jephthah's leadership (Judges 10:5; 11:4, 5, 32,
33), who judged Israel a total of six years (Judges 12:7).
<P>
12.  The Philistine Ascendency for 40 years (c. 1099-1059 BC)
and the Judgeship of Samson for 20 years (c. 1085-1065 BC)
<P>
 Greater attention is given to Samson than to any other of Israel's
judges before Samuel (Judges 13-16).
<P>
 His name, Samson (Hebrew: <I>Shimshon</I>) derives from Hebrew
<I>shemesh</I>, &quot;sun&quot;, which has lead some scholars
to suggest a connection with a sun mythology, Samson's exploits
being equated with the &quot;twelve labors&quot; of Gilgamesh
or Hercules.  The proximity of Beth Shemesh (House of the Sun)
to Samson's birthplace, Zorah, the fact that one of his feats
of strength took place &quot;at the time of wheat harvest&quot;
(Judges 15:1, i.e., approaching mid-summer, and his death between
the pillars of a Philistine temple, possibly symbolic of sunset,
contribute to this point of view.
<P>
 However, it seems to me that the essential historicity of the
biblical record can hardly be doubted.  Samson's birth and death
are carefully documented and there is a close connection to actual
documentable historical situations.  Names like Samson are observable
in the Ugaritic texts of the 14th and 15th century BC, so the
name itself would appear not so unusual: it was, perhaps, a relatively
common Canaanite name.  Thus, its use in Israel would not be so
unexpected.  It might be noted, too, that though Gilgamesh is
recorded as doing rather extraordinary things, it is clear that
he was an actual, historical figure (though it seems very unlikely
that the deeds attributed to him were actual; admitedly, the deeds
of Samson have a similar taste to them, and they almost seem out
of place compared to the stories about the other Judges).
<P>
<I><B> Historical Background</B></I>
<P>
 The Samson narratives provide an invaluable background to the
earlier part of the Philistine oppression.  The Philistines settled
on the coastal plain, around 1200 BC, a generation after the Conquest
(assuming an early date), and once established, they attempted
to expand into the Israelite hill country.  Shamgar's exploits
probably gave temporary relief (Judges 3:31), but a combination
of Philistine and Amorite pressure (Judges 1:34) forced part of
Samson's tribe, the Danites, to migrate north (Judges 18).  The
Danite remnant which remained, with Judah, bore increasing pressure.
 At this stage Philistine rule was not onerous, Judah accepting
it without complaint (Judges 15:11).  It was established by infiltration
rather than by force, and promised obvious economic advantages
to the subject peoples.  The insidious nature of this domination
was a major threat to Israel's continued independence.  Samson's
activities were significant in this light.  Nowhere had he armed
support from his compatriots but his one-man campaign highlighted
the danger and brought the conflict into the open. Even so, Israel
eventually overcame the Philistines only with the greatest difficulty.
<P>
<I><B> Personal History</B></I>
<P>
 Samson was the son of Manoah, whose wife, like Sarah, Hannah
and Elizabeth, was barren.  His birth, like those of Isaac and
John the Baptist, was announced by an angel (Judges 13:3).  He
was to be a Nazarite (Hebrew nazir, meaning &quot;separated&quot;
or &quot;consecrated&quot;) from birth.  Usually the Nazirite
vow was voluntarily taken for a limited period (Numbers 6:1-21).
 Of the stipulations required by the Nazarite vow, Samson took
only one seriously: that concerning his hair.  He was often in
contact with corpses (14:8; and simply because he caused a lot
of people to <I>become</I> corpses) and based on what we see of
his lifestyle, it is unlikely he abstained from wine.
<P>
 Samson's parents lived at Zorah, on the border between Dan and
Judah, in the Shephelah.
<P>
 <B>Samson's first love (14:1-15:8)</B>.  Seeing a Philistine
woman in Timnah (6 km SW of Zorah) he demanded that his unwilling
parents arrange a marriage.  Understandably they were upset, since
she was outside their faith community.  At the wedding feast he
used a riddle to test the thirty young men (who perhaps are more
there to guard Samson than as genuine guests; see 14:11).  They
put pressure on Samson's bride to extract the answer to his riddle
(an unfair one, at that, though they agreed freely to try to guess
it). Samson's response to their correct answer was to kill thirty
Philistine in Ashkelon in order to pay his debt.  Then he departed
(14:13-19).  To escape disgrace, his bride was given to his &quot;best
man&quot; (14:20).  The type of marriage indicated did not involve
permanent cohabitation, but when Samson arrived back in the early
summer with the present customary in such a relationship (15:1)
he was refused entrance.  He took his revenge by catching 300
&quot;foxes&quot; (or perhaps, &quot;jackals&quot;).  He tied
fire brands to their tails and released them into the fields (15:2-5).
 At harvest time, the loss would be considerable.  The Philistines,
in their turn, took an equally vicious revenge upon the Timnite
and his family (15:6).  In a futher escalation of violence, Samson
retaliated by slaughtering the offending Philistines (15:7ff).
<P>
 <B>The attempt to capture Samson at Lehi (15:9-20)</B>.  Seeking
refuge at the rock of Etam, Samson was taken into custody by 3000
men of Judah, resentful that he had disturbed thier peaceful situation
under the Philistines (15:9-13).  His abnormal strength enabled
him to break free and attack the surprised Philistines with a
jawbone of an ass, a formidable weapon in the hands of a determined
man (15:14-17).  Samson was weakened with thirst after this spectacular
success and God provided miraculously for his need (15:18f). 
Verse 20, with its formal statement of Samson's judgeship, probably
marked the end of one account of his life.
<P>
 <B>His downfall and death (16:1-31)</B>.  Samson's interest in
foreign prostitutes eventually proved his undoing.  A warning
of his vulnerability in such circumstances was given at Gaza,
but his unique strength enabled him to escape (16:1-3).  Gaza,
the southernmost of the five Philistine cities was sixty km from
Hebron, but the narrative may indicate that Samson lifted the
city gates to a hill in the general direction of Hebron.  It is
hard to see what would motivate him to haul them sixty kilometers.
<P>
 After this, Samson became infatuated with Delilah, whose home
in the valley of Sorek lay just below Zorah (16:4).  She collaborated
with the Philistines and with heartless tenacity extracted from
Samson the secret of his strength (16:5-20).  
<P>
 Blinded and humiliated, he was paraded as the butt of jokes at
a festival (16:21-27).  For the second time in the story, we see
him call out to God in prayer (cf. 15:18ff).  God answers, and
coupled with the fact that the Philistines had carelessly allowed
his hair to regrow (Numbers 6 allows for a vow to be broken and
then restarted, with the days previously committed left uncounted;
part of the process is to shave off the hair).
<P>
 Samson was able to demolish a possibly already over-stressed
temple (too many people on it), killing both himself and more
Philistines than he had killed previously (16:28-31).  Since the
Philistines formed a ruling class superimposed upon a native population,
and since the deaths would have been from the upper class and
ruling class of Philistine society, the effects of Samson's decimation
would have been considerable.
<P>
 <B>Moral problems raised by the Samson narratives.</B>  Most
of the judges have moral and religious shortcomings, and Samson
is no exception.  He is generally irresponsible, not overtly religious,
and seems to have a taste for prostitutes.  Still, he is included
in the catalogue of heroes of faith (Heb. 11:32).  He is even
empowered by the Holy Spirit (Judges 13:25 and 14:6).   If one
has the mistaken notion that righteous behavior or holiness is
necessary to be used or related to God, then there is no way to
solve the conundrum.  However, if you understand the nature of
salvation by grace, then there is no problem at all.  Once again,
as with all the Judges, Samson serves as a good illustration of
Ephesians 2:8-10:
<P>
 For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith--and this
not from yourselves, it is the gift of God--not by works, so that
no one can boast.  For we are God's workmanship, created in Christ
Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to
do.
<P>
 13. Eli the Priest (c. 1065-1045 BC)
<P>
 Eli follows the events catalogued in Judges; little of his life
except his unfortunate end and his relationship to Samuel is related
at the beginning of the book of Samuel.  He apparently rules the
entire nation, rather than a local area. (1 Samuel 1:9-4:22)
<P>
 14. Samuel the Seer (c. 1045-1020 BC)
<P>
 Samuel is raised by Eli and serves as the Judge until he is called
upon to select Saul and later David as his successors, and as
the first genuine national kings.  Like Eli, he apparently ruled
over the entire Israelite controlled region of Palestine. (1 Samuel
1-28)  Thus, the period of the Judges, assuming an early date
for the Exodus, is reckoned as running from about 1401 BC to about
1020 BC.
<P>
<B>Israel on the Eve of Monarchy</B>
<P>
 Judges 17-21 express the desperate need for some centralized
authority in Israel to regulate both religion and civil order.
 Without such authority, anarchy results, and that is the picture
painted by these last chapters.  The book of Judges serves the
purpose of being an apologetic for kingship.  The anarchy and
need for a king is illustrated by the thrice repeated phrase:
 &quot;In those days Israel had no king; everyone did as he saw
fit.&quot; (Judges 21:25).
<P>
 In chapters 17 and 18 we see a &quot;free market economy&quot;:
the priest sells his services to the highest bidder, unconcerned
with whether he was worshipping correctly.  His only concern was
with how much money he could get.
<P>
 In chapters 19-20 we see incredible cruelty in the rape and murder
of a woman, followed by her dismemberment and then the almost
total extermination of one of the twelve tribes of Israel: Benjamin.
 This happens because Benjamin would not do its civil duty of
prosecuting those who had raped and murdered the woman.
<P>
 On the whole, the period of the Judges was a time of great disorder
and weakness in Israel.  Loyalty to Yahweh and the Mosaic institutions
would have resulted in drawing the tribes together in a common
bond of unity and strength.  But intermittent lapses into the
sensuous nature worship of the Canaanites, with resultant divine
chastisement, kept the nation weak and divided and at the mercy
of one foreign invader after another. 
<P>
 Meanwhile, ambitious neighboring nations were growing stronger
and becoming more and more a threat to the loose confederation
of Israelite tribes, whose noly real tie was a theocratic bond,
the essential meaning and requirements of which they were continually
forgetting.  There was little wonder that it seemed that the only
way out of the sad condition of the preceding three and a half
centuries was to have a king like the surrounding peoples.
<P>
<I><B>Contrast Between Israel and Adjacent Nations</B></I>
<P>
 There was a striking difference in political organization between
Israel and tahe various peoples in Palestine and southern Syria
in the 11th century bC.  The high ideal of a purely theocratic
rule, with the people looking to God alone to lead them, proved
impractical because of weakness on the human side, manifest in
frequent apostasy and lapses into idolatry during the period of
the Judges.
<P>
<B>1. Israel, a Loose Amphictyony (a Greek term meaning &quot;dwellers
around&quot;).</B>  In ancient Greece, associations of neighbroing
states formed around a religious center.  The most important was
the Amphictyonic League (or the Delphic Amphictyony).  Originally
composed of twelve tribes living around Thermopylae, the league
was centered first around the shrine of Demeter and later became
associated with the Temple of Apollo at Delphi.  Member states
sent two kinds of deputies (<I>pylagorai</I> and <I>hiermnemones</I>)
to a council (<I>pylaia</I>) that met twice a year and administered
the temporal affairs of the shrines and their properties, supervised
the treasury, and conducted the Pythian Games.  In the fourth
century BC the league rebuilt the Delphic temple.  Although primarily
religious, the league exercised a political influence through
its membership oath, forbidding destruction of member cities or
the cutting off of water supplies; the <I>hieromnemones</I> could
punish offenders and even proclaim a sacred war against them.
 Other important amphictyonys were the Delian and, in the Archaic
period, the Calaurain (composed of states around the Saronic Gulf).
<P>
 While neighboring nations such as Edom, Moab and Ammon were highly
organized kingdoms, Israel was a mere scantily setup confederation
or amphictyony, depending on guidance from spontaneously arising
leadership and maintaining a bond of national unity around a central
sanctuary.  This central religious institution of a common shrine
around which were grouped the twelve tribes has close parallels
in other Mediterranean clans.
<P>
 Numberless amphictyonies and groupings of amphictyonic character
are mentioned by classical authors from both Greece and Italy.
 A number of them are explicitly stated to have contained twelve
tribes.  The most famous is the Pylaean or Delphic amphictyony
of the eighth century BC.  The Etruscans also had a cultic league
centering around the temple of the goddess Voltumna, to which
representatives of the Etruscan communities gathered annually
at springtime to celebrate games in honor of the goddess.
<P>
<B>2. Israel's Central Sanctuary. </B> Shiloh in the hill country
of Ephraim appears uniformly as israel's first central sanctuary,
although there were local sanctuaries at such places as Bethel,
Gilgal, Gibeon, Dan, Hebron, and so on.  Considering all factors,
Shiloh was a wise choice from the point of view at least of its
central location.  Repeatedly it is said to have been the place
where Joshua set up the Tabernacle and where the Israelites were
assigned their future homes (Joshua 19:51).  There, once a year,
families came to celebrate an important feast of Yahweh at harvest
time (Judges 21:19).  There, Hannah, Samuel's mother, came to
worship (1 Samuel 1:3).  To this central sanctuary she and her
husband bround their young son to be trained for the priesthood
under Eli.
<P>
 Moreover, Israel was not the only country in the ancient Near
East which had its great central sanctuary to which pilgrimages
were made.  Nippur in Babylonia and Nineveh in Assyria (early
second millenium BC) served such purposes in their respective
countries, as is known from contemporary documents.  At Haran:
the temple of Sin; at Qatna: the shrine of Belit-ekall; and at
Byblos: the Sanctuary of Baaltis.  These all performed similar
functions.  While the sanctuary at Shiloh was the focal point
of the amphictyony, the high priest enjoyed important political
as well as religious powers.  Phinehas, the son of Aaron, and
Eli were such priestly leaders.  After the establishment of the
Monarchy, however, the political powers of the priesthood declined.
<P>
<B>3. Neighboring Nations Are Strong Kingdoms.</B>  On the other
hand, adjacent nations offered a striking contrast to the loose
amphictyonic tribal organization of Israel.  Edom, Moab and Ammon
were governed by kings who were much more than tribal emirs, as
is apparent from such monuments as the Baluah stele of the twelth
century and the Mesha Stone of the ninth century, both from Moab.
 Coastal city-states bordering Israel, like Tyre, Sidon and Byblus,
had grown great through expanded commerce and had powerful centralized
authority vested in a king.  Gorwing Aramean states to the norht
and northeast had strong rulers and were becoming a threat.  The
Philistines were governed by &quot;lords&quot; (<I>seranim</I>),
who were apparently tyrants after the Aegean model.
<P>
 These well-organized neighbors were becoming an increasingly
ominous peril to the more or less disorganized Israelite tribes.
 No aid against their encroachments could be looked for from the
ancient empires of the Near East.  Egyptian influence in kAsia
had diminished to virtually nothing by the middle of the eleventh
century BC and the Assyrian Empire, after Tiglath-Pileser I (1113-1074
BC), who had briefly subjugated northern Syria and the Phoenician
coast, withdrew to the Euphrates Valley once more.

<I><B>Israel's Neighbors in the Eleventh Century BC</B></I>
<P>
 Had Assyria or Egypt been in the ascendancy in the pre-monarchic
period in Israel, the Davidic-Solomonic &quot;Empire&quot; would
not have been possible.  As it was, the amphictyonic tribes, instead
of having to confront a major power, faced a number of smaller
but dangerous kingdoms, which surrounded them and began to show
their hostility when Israel began to consolidate and expand under
the leadership of a king.  A study of these various peoples is
essential to an understanding of the founding of the Israelite
Monarchy.
<P>
<B>Ammonites. </B> These were the descendants of Lot (according
to Genesis 19:38, by having sex with his own daughter), and they
lived in the territory between Arnon and the Jabbok north of Moab
and east of the Transjordan tribes of Reuban, Gad and the half-tribe
of Manasseh.  They showed their inveterate hostility to Israel
in the time of the Judges by aiding Eglon, king of Moab, in subjugating
a part of Israel and by their oppression of the East Jordanic
tribes in the time of Jephthah (Judges 10:6-9).  They were a formidable
power just before the establishment of the Israelite kingdom and
were defeated by Saul (1 Samuel 11:1-11).  David defeated the
confederate Syrians and Ammonites (2 Samuel 10) and later his
army took the Ammonite capital (2 Samuel 12:27).
<P>
<B>The Moabites.</B>  They were closely akin to the Ammonites
and also descendants of Lot (according to Genesis 19:37 by him
having sex with his other daughter), and occupied the territory
south of Ammon and north of Edom, between the brook Zered and
the river Arnon. Moab harassed Israel in the early days of the
Judges (Judges 3:12-30) and Saul had to war against them in order
to lay the foundations of the kingdom (1 Samuel 14:47).  David
overcame them and put a large number of the to death (2 Samuel
8:2).
<P>
<B>The Edomites.</B>  According to the Bible, the Edomites were
descendants of Esau (or Edom; see Genesis 36:1-19), and lived
in the region south of Moab and the Dead Sea.  First ruled by
tribal chieftains, who were evidently on the order of Arab sheiks
(Gen. 36:15-19, 40-43), they were later, before the rise of the
Hebrew Monarchy, governed by kings (Gen. 36:31-39).  Their hatred
of the Israelites was manifest in their refusal to allow them
passage through their country on the way up from Egypt (Num. 20:14-21).
 Saul was compelled to fight them (1 Sam. 14:47) and David conquered
and garrisoned the country (2 Sam. 8:13-14).
<P>
 
<P>
<B>The Philistines.</B>  They were siad to have come from Caphtor
or Crete (Jer. 47:4, Amos 9:7), and had increased in power so
formidably that by the time of Saul they threatened to reduce
Israel to hopeless servitude.  Occupying the fertile Maritime
Plain of southwestern Canaan, which lies between Joppa and Gaza,
some fifty miles in length and fifteen in breadth, the main body
of them arrived in the first quarter of the 12th century BC during
a great invasion of sea peoples in the reign of Rameses III of
Egypt.  However, scattered groups of them, evidently as the result
of a much earlier and smaller emigration, had occupied the region
around Gerar on the southern border of Palestine as early as patriarchal
times (Gen. 26:1, 14, 18).
<P>
 The phenomenal expansion of the Philistine's power in the 11th
century BC resulted in the destruction of Israel's central sanctuary
at Shiloh, which had been the rallying point of the Israelite
tribes for almost three and a half centuries.  This epochal event,
whith the capture of the ark of the covenant, which took place
around 1050 BC (cf. 1 Sam. 4:1-21), as the Danish excavations
at Shiloh have shown, sounded the death knell to the old amphictyonic
organization and must have made the institution of the kingship
seem absolutely mandatory to all Israelites who could not see
any practicality in the old theocratic ideal of sole dependence
upon Yahweh's leadership (1 Sam. 8:19-22).
<P>
 After the disaster at Aphe and Ebenezer, Philistine garrisons
are mentioned in the hill country itself (1 Sam. 13:3).  What
is even more indicative of Philistine prowess as the infant Israelite
kingdom was struggling for its very life, is the fact that the
strategic fortress of Bethshan was held by Philistine hands, and
on its walls ironically enough, the bodies of Saul and his sons
were ignominiously nailed after Israel's humiliating defeat at
Mt. Gilboa (1 Sam. 31:10-12).  David, when king repelled invasions
of the Philistines and also fought agains them in their own country
and effectually subdued them (2 Sam. 3:18; 5:17-25; 8:1; etc.).
<P>
<B>The Arameans. </B> The Arameans were a Semitic people (Gen.
10:22, 23).  In the century or two before the establishment of
the Hebrew Monarchy, they had gradually occupied the plain extending
from northern Mesopotamia around Haran westward to the Lebanon
mountains and to the Taurus mountains on the north and beyond
Damascus on the south.  Throughout the last quarter of the period
of the Judges, Aramean influence spread south into Syria to the
very borders of Israel, so that when Saul and David began to retrieve
Israelite fortunes they came in almost immediate collision with
Arameans established in a number of kingdoms north and northeast
of Palestine.  Several different districts are to be distinguished.

<P>
<B>Aram Naharim.</B>  Also called &quot;Aram of the Rivers&quot;.
 Aram Naharaim may conceivably refer to the territory between
the Tigris and Euphrates, but most likely it refers to the general
region of Mesopotamia with its center in the Euphrates-Khabur
region.  In this district Paddan-Aram (&quot;Field of Aram&quot;;
Gen. 24:10; 28:5) and the city of Harran were located; it is where
the patriarchs lived before migrating to Canaan.  The designation
Aram Naharaim was predominantly geographic and no doubt extended
westward considerably beyond the Euphrates as far as Aleppo and
southward perhaps as far as Kadesh on the Orontes.  From this
territory Arameans gradually spread south to form later kingdoms
that appeared almost contemporaneously with the establishment
of the Hebrew kingdom.
<P>
<B>Aram Zobah. </B> This is to be located north of Damascus and
very likely included the city until Rezon renounced allegiance
to Zobah at the time of David's conquest of the country (1 Kings
11:23-25).  It thus appears that Friedrich Delitzsch, who long
ago maintained that Zobah was a place on the edge of the desert,
north of Damascus in the region of Hums and the Antilibanus, was
substantially correct over against the contentions of Hugo Winckler
and Hermann Guthe, who placed it in the land of Hauran, the Biblical
Bashan south of Damascus, or Sina Schiffer and Emil Kraeling,
who narrowly fixed it in Coelesyria, the territory between Lebanon
and Antilebanon.  The latest studies in Assyrian provincial organization,
which was erected on older foundations, prove conclusively that
Delitzsch's original position was correct, and that Zobah, Assyrian
<I>Subatu</I>, was situated north of Damascus and not south of
it.
<P>
 In the days of Saul and David, Zobah was the most powerful of
the Aramaean states of Syria.  The general situation in the Near
Eastern world with the wane of Egyptian and Assyrian power and
the passing of Hittite sway, so propitious for the rise of the
Davidic Empire, was no less opportune ofr the expansion of the
kingdom of Hadadezer of Zobah.  His realm was extensive.  At its
zenith it stretched to the Euphrates River (2 Sam. 8:3), and must
have dominated Damascus on the south, for the Aramaeans there
were not said to have had their own king, as was the case at Hamath
farther north (2 Sam. 8:5, 9), and consequently must have been
subordinate to Zobah.  moreover, it is easy to see how Hadadezer's
power developed to such an extent as to reach to the country east
of the Jordan, where it clashed with the ambitions of Saul (1
Sam. 14:47, LXX).  With David's defeat of Hadadezer it is significant
that Zobah vanishes from the stage of Hebrew hinstory, its place
of annoyance then being taken by Damascus.
<P>
 Several other smaller Aramean states to the southeast of Damascus,
states which had acquired considerable strength by the time of
David's ascendancy, are metnioned also in a somewhat later period.
 These are Maacah, Geshur and Tob, located on the northern and
northeastern borders of Palestine.  These states show the extent
of Aramean penetration southward in the century and a half preceding
the Hebrew Monarchy.
<P>
<B>Maacah.</B>  Maacah lay east of the Jordan within the contemplated
bounds of Israel in close proximity to Mt. Hermon on the north
(josh. 12:15; 13:11).  Close to Maacah lay Geshur (Deut. 3:14;
Josh. 12:5; 13:11)., evidently on the south from Huleh to the
southearn exgtremity of the Sea of Galilee.  From this Aramean
kingdom David obtained a wife, and to there his own son Absalom
fled after the murder of Amnon (2 Sam. 3:3; 13:37).
<P>
<B>Tob.</B>  Tob was also east of the Jordan, and is probably
to be identified with the modern site of et-Taiyibeh, about ten
miles south of Gadara.  Hanun, king of Ammon drew soldier there
to fight against David (2 Sam. 10:6 RV).
<P>
 It is thus apparent that the Aramean expansion westward and
southward during the twelth and eleventh centuries BC continued
unabated throughout the period of the judges.  By the end of that
period the strong Aramean states of Zobah, Beth-Rehob, Maacah,
Geshur and Tob had grown up in north and east Palestine, forming
a strong wall to thwart any sudden expansion on the part of the
Israelite tribes.  There was, it seems, no strong Aramean pressure
on the Hebrews themselves, except in such districts as Bashan
eastward and northeastward of the Lake of Galilee and Naphtali
north and northwest of it, which were overrun during this period.
 There was little danger of clash between Israel and Aram so long
as Israel had no strong central government and no agressive leader.
 But with David;'s succession to the throne, the situation changed.
 Thbe subjugation and incorporation of these peoples into the
Iraelite state was one of the prime factors in making possible
the empire of David and Solomon.
<P>
<B>The Phoenicians.</B>  The Phoenicians or Canaanites were forming
maritime states in the northwest along the Mediterranean coast
while the Aramean states were crystallizing in the north and northeast.
 By the time of David (c. 1000 BC) the Canaanites in the Tyre-Sidon
area had been united in a strong state with its capital at Tyre.
 It offered little opposition to David's empire building for a
definite reason.  Instead of seeking to expand its territories
by force of arms it endeavored to expand its influence and its
raw materials throughout the Mediterranean world by trade and
treaty.  David found the Tyrian king, Iram I (c. 969-936 BC),
who appears in Phoenician records as both a conqueror and a builder,
responsive to his overtures of friendship and won him as a valuable
ally, and the ties of amity continued through Solomon's reign
(1 Kings 9:10-14).
<P>
<I><B>The Story of Ruth</B></I>
<P>
 Though many fail to notice, the story of Ruth actually falls
into the period of the Judges, before the coming of the Monarchy
(and the story of Samuel the prophet, is transitional, with Eli
and then him as the last two judges).  Keep in mind, too, that
Ruth was from Moab.  Even in the midst of the apostacy of the
nation of Israel as a whole, there were still those who hadn't
bowed to the syncritism, who followed the true God alone, rather
than adopting idols.  Occasionally, as in the story of Ruth, one
was even able to successfully bring a non-Israelite to a true
knowledge of God.  Notice that Ruth had been fully converted to
the faith of Israel (Ruth 1:15-18).  It is no wonder that she
was one of David's ancestors and hence also an ancestor of Jesus
Christ (Ruth 4:13-22).  Because she was an ancestor of David,
Ruth's story was preserved.
<P>
<B>The Time of the Book. </B> The book was probably written during
the reign of David.  This conclusion is based on the following
considerations:
<P>
 <blockquote>1. The genealogy, having been brought to David (4:17, 22), demands
a later date than the period of the theocracy.
<P>
 2. David, a man of letters, probably had the book written in
an effort to preserve his lineage.</blockquote>
<P>
 
<P>
<B>Prevaling OT Law in the book. </B> The Book of Ruth illustrates
the principle of the kinsman redeemer.
<P>
 In Israel, it was an abomination to be childless.  Perpetuation
of the family name was of supreme importance to the Jews.  God,
perhaps, allowed this so that the race might grow and persevere.
<P>
 The law allowed the wife of a deceased man to go to his brother
so that he (the brother) might raise a seed for the deceased.
 This situation demanded absolute willingness on both parties.
 The law of Deuteronomy 25:1-10 is illustrated by Ruth 4:1-8.
