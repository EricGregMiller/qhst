&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Note the following, which have been circled.  On the right of the page are words running up and down the page instead of across; this is a marginal gloss, where words were added to the text which had been left out.  On the left of the page you can clearly see the stitching which held the sheets of skin together (the scrolls were written on skin or papyrus).<P>
