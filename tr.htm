<H1>Notes on the King James Translation
and the so-called Textus Receptus</H1>

<P>
<B>I. Introduction. </B>
<P>
In the minds of some individuals the King James Translation of
1611 has become the only legitimate translation of the Bible in
the English language. As far as they are concerned, all other
translations are unfaithful and purposefully misleading.
<P>
Those who disagree are often castegated as brain-washed pseudo-intellectuals
who have been led astray by &quot;so-called&quot; modern scholarship.
Therefore, it is difficult to respond to those who hold a KJV
only position because they have &quot;poisoned the well&quot;
of discussion -- that is, before any information exchange can
take place, they have already discounted the reliability and reputation
of any who would dare disagree.
<P>
This article will present an example of the sort of arguments
used by those who believe that the KJV is the only acceptable
translation, followed by a point by point refutation and a demonstration
of the inferiority of the text of the KJV and its many errors
of translation. The purpose of the article is to help those who
have been exposed to the KJV only position and been confused by
it, but who have not yet swallowed it and built their life and
faith upon it.
<P>
<B>II. The KJV Only Argument </B>
<P>
The KJV argument will be presented by quoting from those who believe
it. The following is from a pamphlet produced by J.J. Ray:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Any version of the Bible, that does not agree with the <U>Greek
Textus Receptus</U>, from which the King James Bible was translated
in 1611, is certainly to be founded upon corrupted manuscripts.
Origen, being a textual critic, is supposed to have corrected
numerous portions of the sacred manuscripts. Evidence to the contrary
shows he changed them to agree with his own human philosophy of
mystical and allegorical ideas. Thus, through deceptive scholarship
of this kind, certain manuscripts became corrupt. Evidently from
this source our modern revised version Bibles and paraphrases
have come. Read pages 900-902, Vol. 16, 1936 edition Encylopedia
[sic] Britannica, and you will see that Origen taught the Lord
Jesus Christ is a created being who did not have eternal existence
as God.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The following, taken from an anonymous, hand-written note, is
an example of the approach taken by those who believe that the
KJV alone is to be used and accepted. The target is the NIV.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
A. The New International Version is a mutilated version, to say
the least. Why isn't it the same as the KJV 1611?

<br>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
1. because the NIV comes from a corrupted textual basis -- the
Alexandrian, Westcott-Hort Critical Text instead of the Textus
Receptus (T.R.)
<p>


2. Because the NIV translators did not have the same high view
of Scripture as did the King James translators.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<br>

B. Mutilating John 3:16 with &quot;one and only&quot; instead
of &quot;only begotten Son.&quot; (Only begotten Son is much stronger
on the Deity of Christ.)
<P>

C. Changed the word &quot;author&quot; to &quot;pioneer&quot;
in both Hebrews 2:10 and Hebrews 12:2.
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
1. This follows the James Moffatt translation. Moffat was a noted
modernist and liberal.
<P>


2. The two words &quot;author&quot; and &quot;pioneer&quot; have
nothing in common whatsoever. They are two completely different
words as is easily seen.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
D. Eliminates the old pronouns &quot;thee, thou,&quot; and so
on, as in Matthew 6:9-10 and other places.
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
1. These pronouns lend appropriate dignity and majesty to the
Word of God. 2. These translators need to be consistent. Do they
sing, &quot;Come you fount of every blessing&quot;?
<P>


E. Mark 16:9-20; John 7:53-8:11 If these passages are not in the
best manuscripts (only their opinion), then why even bother printing
them, since they left out so many other verses?
<P>


F. 1 Timothy 3:16 and 1 John 5:7, in the NIV translation mutilate
the deity of Christ and the Trinity, respectively.
<P>


G. There could be much more. The NIV is not a faithful translation,
it is deceiving and erroneous. Just look at the following examples:
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
1. It omits the following entirely:

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
a. Matthew 17:21 Comment: Don't the NIV translators believe in
prayer and fasting?


<br>
b. Matthew 18:11 Don't they believe Jesus came to save?
<br>


c. Matthew 23:14 Comment: Don't they condemn cruelty to widows
and hypocrits?
<br>


d. Mark 7:16
<br>


e. Mark 9:44 Comment: Don't they believe Hell has fire?
<br>

f. Mark 9:46 Comment: Same as above.
<br>


g. Mark 11:26
<br>


h. Mark 15:28 Comment: Don't they believe in fulfilled prophesy?
<br>


i. Luke 17:36
<br>


j. Luke 23:17
<br>


k. John 5:33-34
<br>


l. Acts 8:37 Comment: This is one of the greatest verses in the
Bible on the deity of Christ. Why leave it out?
<br>

m. Acts 15:34
<br>

n. Acts 24:7
<br>


o. Acts 28:29
<br>


p. Romans 16:24
<P>

<P>
<B>III. Response to the KJV Only Argument </B>
<P>
The short and sweet answer is that there is no truth to the KJV
only arguments. However, it is necessary to go into specifics:
<P>
1. What Origin really believed about the Trinity is somewhat different
than that given by the KJV onlies. It is one thing to read <I>about</I>
Origen. It is another thing to read what he himself wrote. Take
a look at some relevent sections of his <I>Principiis</I>:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The particular points clearly delivered in the teachings of the
apostles are as follows:-- First, That there is one God, who created
and arranged all things, and who, when nothing existed, called
all things into being -- God from the first creation and foundation
of the world --...Secondly, That Jesus Christ Himself, who came
(into the world), was born of the Father before all creatures;
that, after He had been the servant of the Father in the creation
of all things -- &quot;For by Him were all things made&quot; --
He in the last times, divesting Himself (of his glory), became
a man, and was incarnate although God, and while made a man remained
the God which He was;...Then, Thirdly, the apostles related that
the Holy Spirit was associated in honour and dignity with the
Father and the Son....
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
John, however, with more sublimity and propriety, says in the
beginning of his Gospel, when defining God by a special definition
to be the Word, &quot;And God was the Word, and this was in the
beginning with God.&quot; Let him, then, who assigns a beginning
to the Word or Wisdom of God, take care that he be not guilty
of impiety against the unbegotten Father Himself, seeing he denies
that He had always been a Father, and had generated the Word,
and had possessed wisdom in all preceding periods...
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We worship one God, the Father and the Son, therefore, as we have
explained; and our argument against the worship of other gods
still continues valid. And we do not &quot;reverence beyond measure
one who has but lately appeared,&quot; as though He did not exist
before; for we believe Himself when He says, &quot;Before Abraham
was, I am.&quot; Again He says, &quot;I am the truth;&quot; and
surely none of us is so simple as to suppose that truth did not
exist before the time when Christ appeared. We worship, therefore,
the Father of truth, and the Son, who is the truth; and these,
while they are two, considered as persons or subsistences, are
one in unity of thought, in harmony and in identity of will. So
entirely are they one, that he who has seen the Son, &quot;who
is the brightness of God's glory, and the express image of His
person,&quot; has seen in Him who is the image of God, God Himself.
(<I>The Ante-Nicene Fathers, vol. IV, Origen de Principiis</I>.
Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1956, pp. 240, 246, 643-644)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
As becomes clear, Origen believed in the Trinity, despite what
some of his critics may say.
<P>
2. To suggest that those who translated the NIV had a less than
high view of scripture is to libel them. The Preface to the NIV
states the following:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
From the beginning of the project, the Committee on Bible Translation
held to certain goals for the New International Version: that
it would be an accurate translation and one that would have clarity
and literary quality and so prove suitable for public and private
reading, teaching, preaching, memorizing and liturgical use. The
Committee also sought to preserve some measure of continuity with
the long tradition of translating the Scriptures into English.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
In working toward these goals, the translators were united in
their commitment to the authority and infallibility of the Bible
as God's Word in written form. They believe that it contains the
divine answer to the deepest needs of humanity, that it sheds
unique light on our path in a dark world, and that it sets forth
the way to our eternal well-being....
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
...We offer this version of the Bible to him in whose name and
for whose glory it has been made. We pray that it will lead many
into a better understanding of the Holy Scriptures and a fuller
knowledge of Jesus Christ the incarnate Word, of whom the Scriptures
so faithfully testify.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
3. Much is made by KJV onlies of &quot;only begotten&quot; in
John 3:16; they argue that to translate it any other way is to
mistranslate and mutilate the text.
<P>
The reality is, that to translate <I>monogeneis</I> as &quot;only
begotten&quot; is the real mistranslation. Certainly the Greek
word <I>mono</I> means &quot;only&quot; and the Greek word <I>geneis</I>
means &quot;to give birth to&quot; or &quot;beget&quot;; however,
when combined they mean something entirely different, just as
the combination &quot;butter&quot; and &quot;fly&quot; do not
result in an insect bothersome to horses that would taste good
on your popcorn. In Hebrews 11:17 we are told:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
By faith Abraham, when God tested him, offered Isaac as a sacrifice.
He who had received the promises was about to sacrifice his one
and only son...
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The word that the NIV translates &quot;one and only&quot; or that
the KJV translates &quot;only begotten&quot; is the Greek word
<I>monogeneis</I>. It is obvious, with a little thought, that
Isaac is not Abraham's &quot;only begotten&quot; son. Not only
did Abraham also have Ishmael, we are told in Genesis 25:1-6 that
he remarried after Sarah's death and had six children by his second
wife, Keturah; in addition, we are told that he had &quot;sons
of his concubines&quot;.
<P>
The Septuagint, the Greek translation of the Old Testament used<I>
monogeneis</I> to translate Hebrew words which in English we translate
as &quot;precious&quot; or &quot;unique&quot; (cf. Psalm 22:20
and 35:17, for example where it occurs in the phrase &quot;my
precious life&quot;). This would be the proper translation of
the term <I>monogeneis</I>, better even than the NIV's &quot;one
and only&quot;, though that is considerably better than the KJV's
mistranslation.
<P>
4. Some KJV only people try to say that the NIV translates Hebrews
2:10 and Hebrews 12:2 with the word &quot;pioneer&quot; instead
of the word &quot;author&quot;. Oddly, the NIV does not use the
word &quot;pioneer&quot;. It uses the word &quot;author&quot;.
The KJV onlyites have misrepresented the NIV and then criticized
it for a nonexistent problem.
<P>
This is either sloppy work on their part or outright deception.
<P>
5. The old pronouns do not lend dignity to the text. The old pronouns
are just that: old. In 1611 everyone used &quot;thee&quot; and
&quot;thou&quot;, educated and uneducated, professor or fisherman.
There is nothing special or dignified about the language used
in the Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek texts. In fact, the NT was written
in what is called <I>koine</I> Greek -- that is <I>common</I>
Greek, the Greek that ordinary people used in contrast to the
literary or classical Greek of the philosphers, poets and dramatists.
And if we want to talk about dignity, perhaps we should contrast
the KJV's translation of 2 Kings 18:27 and 2 Kings 9:8 with that
of the NIV:
<P>
<B>KJV:</B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
2 Kings 18:27
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
But Rabshakeh said unto them, Hath my master sent me to thy master,
and to thee, to speak these words? hath he not sent me to the
men which sit on the wall, that they may eat their own dung and
drink their own piss with you?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
2 Kings 9:8
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
For the whole house of Ahab shall perish: and I will cut off from
Ahab him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up
and left in Israel...
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<B>NIV:</B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
2 Kings 18:27
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
But the commander replied, &quot;Was it only to your master and
you that my master sent me to say these things, and not to the
men sitting on the wall -- who, like you, will have to eat their
own filth and drink their own urine?&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
2 Kings 9:8
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The whole house of Ahab will perish. I will cut off from Ahab
every last male in Israel -- slave or free.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<B>IV. History of the Text </B>
<P>
The King James Translation of 1611 is based on the so-called <I>Textus
Receptus</I>. This <I>Textus Receptus</I> is essentially the same
as the Majority Text and the Byzantine text type.
<P>
Abundant evidence exists and is constantly growing to show that
critical opinion and methods were known at least from the very
early days of the formation of the NT Canon.
<P>
The era of printing obviously marks a new epoch. Among available
manuscripts choice must be made and a standard set, and in view
of the material at hand it is remarkable how ably the work was
done. It began in Spain under Cardinal Ximenes of Toledo, who
printed at Alcala (Complutum) in 1514 the NT volume of his great
Polyglot, though it was not actually issued until 1522. Meanwhile,
Erasmus, a Dutch scholar, under patronage of Froben the printer
of Basel, had been preparing a Greek NT and it was published early
in 1516. It was the first published (printed with movable type)
Greek New Testament. At the urging of a publisher who wanted to
do be first, he prepared it very hastily, as he himself admitted.
He had only about half a dozen Greek manuscripts, none of them
earlier than the tenth century AD.
<P>
In 1522 Erasmus published his third edition.
<P>
His 4th edition in 1537 contains his definitive text. The next
important step was taken by Robert Estienne (Stephanus), whose
3rd edition, &quot;<I>Regia</I>,&quot; a folio published in Paris
in 1550, was a distinct advance, and, though based directly upon
the work of Ximenes and Erasmus, had marginal readings from 15
new manuscripts, one of which was Codex Bezae. Theodore Beza himself
worked with Stephanus' son Henri and brought out nine editions
of the NT, but no great critical advance was made in them. The
same may be said of the seven Elzevir editions brought out at
Leyden and Amsterdam between 1624 and 1678, the second, that of
1633, in the preface of which occurs the phrase <I>&quot;Textum
ergo habes nune ab omnibus receptum&quot;</I>, became the continental
standard, as the 1550 edition of Stephanus had for England. The
1550 edition of Stephanus was the so called &quot;<I>Textus Receptus</I>&quot;,
used by the translators of the KJV.
<P>
The most notorious case of an added reading in the TR -- and in
this case there is no doubt about its having been added -- is
found at 1 John 5:7. It is the strongest statement in the KJV
on the Trinity, but it has no basis in the Greek text. It is found
in the KJV, of course, because it is in the <I>Textus Receptus</I>.
How did it get there? Erasmus did not have it in his first edition
of the Greek New Testament (1516) or his second edition (1519).
It is thought that under Roman Catholic pressure -- because the
passage was in the Latin Vulgate -- Erasmus put it in his third
edition (1522). Martin Luther wisely did not include it in his
German New Testament of that same year. It seems that Roman Catholics
produced Codex Montfortianus, inserting this passage from the
Latin. It is a sixteenth century manuscript in Dublin.
<P>
The facts are that these added words are not quoted by any Greek
Fathers of the early church and are absent from all the early
versions. They were not in the text of the original Latin Vulgate
made by Jerome but were inserted later. There can be no doubt
today that the words are not a part of the original text of 1
John.
<P>
<B>V. KJV Problems </B>
<P>
<I>1. Manuscript errors resulting in contradictions </I>
<P>
Compare the following passages:
<P>
2 Kings 24:8 with 2 Chronicles 36:9
<P>
Ezra 2:5 with Nehemiah 7:10
<P>
Ezra 2:69 with Nehemiah 7:70-72
<P>
1 Kings 7:16 with 2 Kings 25:17
<P>
2 Samuel 8:13 with 1 Chronicles 18:12
<P>
1 Samuel 18:25, 27 with 2 Samuel 3:14
<P>
2 Samuel 8:4 with 1 Chronicles 18:41
<P>
Kings 6:2 with 2 Chronicles 3:4
<P>
1 Kings 9:23 with 2 Chronicles 8:10
<P>
2 Samuel 23:8 with 1 Chronicles 11:11
<P>
1 Kings 4:26 with 2 Chronicles 9:25
<P>
These are all examples of errors created by scribes when they
were copying. For some, there are manuscripts that reconcile the
problems, for others, we still don't know what the correct numbers
are, yet the KJV retains all these errors.
<P>
<I>2. Translation errors: </I>
<P>
The King James has made some major errors in translation. The
following are just a few examples. Compare the KJV reading with
that of the NIV:
<P>
<B>Isaiah 45:7 </B>
<P>
<B>KJV:</B> I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace,
and create evil: I the LORD do all these things.
<P>
<B>NIV:</B> I form the light and create darkness, I bring prosperity
and create disaster; I, the LORD, do all these things.
<P>
<B>Amos 3:6 </B>
<P>
<B>KJV: </B>Shall a trumpet be blown in the city, and the people
not be afraid? shall there be evil in a city, and the LORD hath
not done it?
<P>
<B>NIV: </B>When a trumpet sounds in a city, do not the people
tremble? When disaster comes to a city, has not the LORD caused
it?
<P>
<B>Luke 13:24 and 2 Timothy 2:24 </B>
<P>
Two distinct Greek words are both rendered &quot;strive&quot;.
The term in Luke has the sense &quot;to strive to achieve&quot;
while the word in 2 Timothy has the sense of &quot;to quarrel.&quot;
<P>
<B>KJV: </B>Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I
say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.
<P>
<B>KJV: </B>And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be
gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient.
<P>
<B>NIV:</B> Make every effort to enter through the narrow door,
because many, I tell you, will try to enter and will not be able
to.
<P>
<B>NIV:</B> And the Lord's servant must not quarrel; instead,
he must be kind to everyone, able to teach, not resentful.
<P>
<B>Daniel 11:9 </B>
<P>
<B>KJV:</B> So the king of the south shall come into his kingdom,
and shall return into his own land.
<P>
<B>Hebrew, my translation; cf. NIV: </B>And he [the king of the
north] will come into the kingdom of the king of the south and
will return to his land.
<P>
<B>1 Thessalonians 5:22 </B>
<P>
<B>KJV:</B> Abstain from all appearance of evil.
<P>
<B>NIV:</B> Avoid every kind of evil.
<P>
<B>VI. The Nature of Translation </B>
<P>
A. How translation occurs
<P>
It is important to realize -- and most people who have not learned
a second language wouldn't know -- that there is no such thing
as a one-to-one correspondence between languages. You cannot have
a word for word translation that is at all readable, because the
word order is different, the nature of the grammar is different
and even the sense of a word may cover a wider or smaller range
than the corresponding English word.
<P>
For instance, the word &quot;house&quot; in Hebrew can mean &quot;immediate
family&quot; or &quot;a royal dynasty&quot; besides the equivalent
English idea of a building where a person dwells. Therefore to
have an accurate English translation you cannot simply translate
the Hebrew word with &quot;house&quot;; you need to translate
it according to which of the possible meanings is intended.
<P>
Idioms, likewise, do not translate across directly: for instance
the English phrase &quot;I'm sick and tired of apple pie&quot;
if translated literally could give a reader in another language
the false impression that the individual in question is sleepy
and ready to throw up.
<P>
Consider the following &quot;literal translation&quot; of the
first verse of the Bible, which maintains the Hebrew word order
and phrasing and ask yourself if it is easily comprehensible:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>In-beginning he-created God (definite direct object) the-heavens
and- (definite direct object) the-earth. </B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
But even this is not entirely accurate in a word for word sense,
because biblical Hebrew does not strictly have past tense; however,
there is no other way to indicate perfect aspect (completed action).
<P>
And in front of the single words (they are only one word in Hebrew)
&quot;the-heavens&quot; and &quot;the-earth&quot;, is a Hebrew
word that indicates that what follows is a definite direct object
-- a word, as you can see, that is hardly translatable into English
at all.
<P>
Having said all this, one might imagine that this first verse
is a complicated sentence. Not at all. It is remarkably simple.
It only becomes difficult if we expect translation to be &quot;literal&quot;.
It isn't. All translation, by its very nature, is paraphrastic
and interpretive.
<P>
The way translation happens is as follows. The translator learns
a foreign language and learns it well. Learning Hebrew or Greek
is just like learning French or Spanish in high school. There
is nothing mysterious or special about the ancient languages.
Then the translator reads the foreign text and understands it.
Having understood it, he or she then puts it into the best English
possible.
<P>
There is no mystery associated with the translation of the Bible,
nor are there any significant disagreements between translations.
However, by the nature of what translation is -- the work of individuals
with their own separate styles -- the wording of say, <I>Today's
English Version</I> is not going to be identical to the <I>King
James Version</I> or the <I>New International Version</I>. This
is not because anyone is trying to twist something or make it
say what it doesn't, but only because each translator is going
to word the translation as he thinks best. But the MEANING will
generally be the same. And of course between the King James and
the more modern translations there is also the gap caused by the
change in the English language itself -- we don't speak like the
people in Shakespeare's time did, but their way of speaking is
no &quot;grander&quot; or any more &quot;eloquent&quot; than ours.
King James English was the way any farmer or fisherman of 1611
would have talked, just as <I>Today's English Version</I> or the
<I>New International Version</I> is close to the way an average
person speaks today. For all the snobbishness of attitude on the
part of some regarding Shakespeare today, in his own day he was
considered somewhat vulgar and not a little risque. Shakespeare
was like an ordinary television drama or sitcom is for us today.
<P>
<B>VII. Textual Criticism </B>
<P>
KJV only people will expend considerable time and energy on finding
places in the text of modern translations that &quot;leave out&quot;
selected passages. Usually the response will be that &quot;see,
this proves that the NIV (or whatever modern translation of the
Bible is being castegated) doesn't believe in this doctrine&quot;
or is &quot;weak on this doctrine.&quot; Such comments are a bit
offensive, since there are usually plenty of other passages in
the newer translations that such critics conveniently ignore,
which speak on the same subject.
<P>
So why <I>do </I>the modern translations leave things out? Those
who critisize the modern translations will be quick to quote Revelation
22:19:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
And if any man shall take away from the words of this prophesy,
God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out
of the holy city, and fromt he things which are written in this
book (KJV)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
However, one rarely, if ever hears them quote the preceding verse,
verse 18:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
....If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto
him the plagues that are written in this book...(KJV)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Yet,<I> adding in</I> is precisely what the KJV is guilty of,
and those things that the newer translations &quot;leave out&quot;
are those things that the KJV unjustly &quot;added in.&quot;
<P>
It is necessary, therefore, to give a little discussion on the
nature of textual criticism in general so that the reasons for
the specific ommissions can be stated.
<P>
One change since the time of the King James translation, of course,
is the improvement in the texts that are available to today's
translators. They are older and that much closer to the original;
moreover, the methods of textual criticism -- the science of comparing
the different and sometimes inconsistent manuscripts and determining
which one is the closest to the original reading -- have advanced
considerably since the 1600's.
<P>
The history of the biblical texts shows clearly that all of them
stand far removed from the originals both by time and by the process
of transmission. They contain not only scribal errors, but even
some actual transformations of the text, both deliberate and accidental.
By means of textual criticism we attempt to find all the alterations
that have occurred and then recover the earliest possible form
of the text.
<P>
1. Methods
<P>
Textual criticism proceeds in three steps:
<P>
a. All the variant readings of the text are collected and arranged.
Of course, this is the very reason textual criticism is necessary
at all. If we had only a single copy, there would be no questions,
but since we have several, which all say different things, we
have a problem. Which text accurately records the original statements?
We are in the position of a man with two watches: never quite
sure what time it is.
<P>
b. The variants must then be examined.
<P>
c. The most likely reading is then determined.
<P>
The simple fact that the Masoretic text of the Old Testament (the
standard text essentially the Textus Receptus of the OT) occasionally
differs with the quotations of the Old Testament in the New, indicates
need for textual criticism. Because the New Testament is inspired,
it is wise to go with the Holy Spirit's decisions regarding which
reading is the correct one.
<P>
As an example, look at Hebrews 10:5-7 in the KJV:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and
offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me:
In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure.
Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written
of me,) to do thy will, O God.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Now look at Psalm 40:6-8, which this passage in Hebrews was quoting:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast thou
opened: burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required.
Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written
of me, I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within
my heart.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Notice the differences. The New Testament follows the reading
of the Greek translation, the Septuagint, which was made about
250 BC.
<P>
It should be remembered that the Masoretic Text, produced between
600 and 1000 AD, was done by Jewish scholars who were not without
their biases. An obvious bias would be an anti-Christian one.
It should not surprise us that the Masoretes would prefer readings
that differed from the New Testament or were in any way a comfort
to Christians.
<P>
In addition, the demonstrable conflicts between the synoptic sections
of the OT (Samuel-Kings and Chronicles, for instance -- see the
list above) also demonstrates the need for textual criticism and
indicates the unreliability of this so-called <I>Textus Receptus</I>
of the Old Testament, the Masoretic Text.
<P>
2. The most important Hebrew manuscripts for Old Testament textual
criticism are:
<P>
a. The St. Petersburg (or Leningrad) Codex, 1008 A.D. It is the
largest and only complete manuscript of the entire Old Testament.
<P>
b. The Aleppo Codex, 930 A.D. It used to be a complete copy of
the Old Testament, but was partially destroyed in a synagogue
fire in 1948.
<P>
c. The British Museum Codex, 950 A.D. It is an incomplete copy
of the Pentateuch.
<P>
d. The Cairo Codex, 895 A.D. A copy of the Former and Latter Prophets
(Joshua, Judges, 1 and 2 Samuel, 1 and 2 Kings, Isaiah, Jeremiah,
Ezekiel, and the twelve minor prophets).
<P>
e. The St. Petersburg (Leningrad) Codex of the Prophets, 916 A.D.
containing only the Latter Prophets.
<P>
f. The Reuchlin Codex of the Prophets, 1105 A.D.
<P>
g. Cairo Geniza fragments, 6th to 9th century, A.D.
<P>
h. Qumran Manuscripts (the Dead Sea Scrolls), 200 B.C - 70 A.D.
<P>
3. The most important ancient translations of the Old Testament
into languages other than Hebrew are:
<P>
a. The Septuagint (several versions)
<P>
b. The Aramaic Targums (several versions)
<P>
c. The Syriac Peshitta
<P>
d. The Samaritan Pentateuch
<P>
e. The Latin Vulgate
<P>
f. Citations in the Greek New Testament
<P>
4. Ideally, the work of textual criticism should proceed with
all of these ancient versions and copies readily available. There
are then some basic rules that help place the textual criticism
of the Bible, whether Old or New Testament, on a firm basis that
generally avoids arbitrariness and subjectivity.
<P>
a. For the Old Testament, where the Hebrew manuscripts and the
ancient versions agree, we may assume that the original reading
has been preserved. Likewise, with the New Testament, where the
various manuscripts agree, we may assume the original text has
been preserved. To our great relief, this covers 95 per cent of
the Bible.
<P>
b. Where the manuscripts differ among themselves, one should choose
either the more difficult reading from the point of view of language
and subject matter or the reading that most readily makes the
development of the other readings intelligible. In order to make
this choice, it is necessary that the critic have a thorough knowledge
of the history and character of the various manuscripts. It needs
also to be realized that these criteria work together and complement
one another. A &quot;more difficult reading&quot; does not mean
a &quot;meaningless reading.&quot;
<P>
c. However, the critic must not assume that just because a reading
appears meaningless that it necessarily is. Scribes are not likely
to turn a meaningful passage into gibberish. Therefore, if a passage
is not understandable, that is often as far as we can go. We must,
as scholars, acknowledge our own ignorance.
<P>
d. With the Old Testament, where the Hebrew manuscripts and the
translations differ, and a superior reading cannot be demonstrated
on the basis of the above rules, then one should, as a matter
of first principle, allow the Hebrew text to stand, unless it
differs with the New Testament, in which case the New Testament
reading will obtain. With text criticism of the New Testament,
one will generally choose the shorter reading because of the tendency
of scribes to try to &quot;explain&quot; passages.
<P>
e. Where the different manuscripts differ and none of them seem
to make any sense, one may attempt a conjecture concerning the
true reading -- a conjecture that must be validated by demonstrating
the process of the textual corruption that would have lead to
the existing text forms. Such a conjecture, however, must not
be used to validate the interpretation of a whole passage in that
it might have been made on the basis of an expectation derived
from the whole.
<P>
5. The Causes of Textual Corruption
<P>
The goal of textual criticism is to remove the textual errors
and restore the original readings. To aid in this goal, it is
helpful if the textual critic has an idea of what sorts of errors
he or she is likely to find.
<P>
When copying out a text, errors occur in every conceivable way,
as we no doubt know from our own experiences. Sometimes it is
difficult to explain, even to ourselves, how we might have come
to make a particular error. Therefore it is unlikely that we will
be able to correct or explain everything that has eluded the scribes
over the centuries. A reading that appears doubtful or corrupt
to us today may have been caused by a hole or some other damage
to the copyist's manuscript. Or maybe the letters or words in
a given section of his text were faded and nearly illegible, forcing
the copyist to make his best guess. Moreover, a single error can
give rise to many others, leaving us with no clue as to how it
might have happened.
<P>
And of course, as always, the assumption of a textual error may
really be only a cover for our failure to understand the language
or the idiom.
<P>
Beyond these unrecoverable sorts of errors, there are two categories
of errors that may be distinguished and often corrected: errors
due to an unintentional, mechanical lapse on the part of the copyist
(often called Errors of Reading and Writing), and two, errors
that are the result of deliberate alteration (called Intentional
Alterations).
<P>
a. Errors of Reading and Writing
<P>
1. Confusion of similar letters
<P>
In Hebrew, there are several letters which look very similar to
one another: the B and K, R and D, H and T, W and Y.
<P>
2. Transposition of Letters
<P>
3. Haplography -- a fancy word that means when there were two
or more identical or similar letters, groups of letters, or words
all in sequence, one of them gets omitted by error. Of course,
there is some evidence that some of these supposed &quot;errors&quot;
are actually equivalent to English contractions like &quot;don't&quot;
instead of &quot;do not&quot; and therefore are not errors at
all.
<P>
4. Dittography -- another fancy word that refers to an error caused
by repeating a letter, group of letters , a word or a group of
words. The opposite, really, of Haplography.
<P>
5. Homoioteleuton -- an even fancier word which refers to the
error that occurs when two words are identical, or similar in
form, or have similar endings and are close to each other. It
is easy in this sort of situation for the eye of the copyist to
skip from one word to the other, leaving out everything in between.
A good example of this occurs in 1 Samuel 14:41:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Therefore Saul said unto the Lord God of <B>Israel</B>, give a
perfect lot. (KJV)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Therefore Saul said, &quot;O Lord God of<B> Israel</B>, why hast
thou not answered thy servant this day? If this guilt is in me
or in Jonathan my son, O Lord, God of Israel, give Urim: but if
this guilt is in thy people <B>Israel</B>, give Thummim. (RSV)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The copyist's eye jumped from the first instance of the word &quot;Israel&quot;
to the last instance, leaving out everything in between for the
reading that the KJV translators had at their disposal. The word
translated &quot;perfect lot&quot; in the KJV is spelled with
the same consonants in Hebrew (TH-M-M) as the word Thummim (the
vowels were added to the Hebrew text by the Masoretes between
AD 600 and 1000.
<P>
6. Errors of Joining and Dividing Words.
<P>
This is more a problem in the New Testament than it is in the
Old Testament, for while the Greek manuscripts were written well
into the Medieval period without spacing or dividing signs between
words, there is no evidence that this was EVER the case with the
Old Testament Hebrew texts. In fact, the evidence is very strong
to the contrary; inscriptions on walls from the time of Hezekiah
actually had dots between each word to separate them from one
another.
<P>
b. Deliberate Alterations
<P>
The Samaritan Pentateuch, as an example, is notorious for its
purposeful changes designed to help legitimize some of their sectarian
biases. They were sort of like the Jehovah's witnesses of their
day.
<P>
A more substantive change in the Hebrew text came after the Babylonian
captivity in the time of Ezra (fifth century BC) when the alphabet
changed from the Old Hebrew Script to the Aramaic Square Script
-- in which all copies of the Old Testament except for the Samaritan
Pentateuch are written.
<P>
It should not surprise us that there has been a certain amount
of alteration in the text over time, since the Bible was not intended
to be the object of scholarly study but rather was to be read
by the whole believing community as God's word to them. Thus,
the text would undergo adaptations to fit the linguistic needs
of the community. For instance in Isaiah 39:1 the Masoretic Text
preserves a rare word, <I>hazaq</I>, which has the sense of &quot;to
get well, recuperate.&quot; The community that produced the Dead
Sea scrolls altered this word to the more common Hebrew word for
get well, <I>zayah</I>. Other examples of adaptation to colloquial
usage are likely. The lack of early material for the Old Testament
makes it impossible to demonstrate these sorts of alterations
on a larger scale. But a few small alterations are easily demonstrable.
<P>
The treatment of the divine name Baal is an example of deliberate
change for theological reasons. In personal names which included
the word &quot;Baal&quot;, which simply means &quot;master&quot;
or &quot;lord&quot;, the scribes deliberately replaced &quot;Baal&quot;
with &quot;Bosheth,&quot; which means &quot;shame&quot;. Hence,
Jonathan's son was actually named &quot;Meribbaal&quot; rather
than &quot;Mephibosheth&quot; (cf. 1 Chron. 8:34, 9:30 and 2 Sam
9:6, 19:24, 21:7)
<P>
Another example of deliberate alteration is found in Job 1:5,
11 and 2:5, 9 where we now read the word <I>berek</I>, to bless
(with God as the object) even though we should expect to find
the word <I>qalal</I>, to curse. The scribes replaced the offensive
expression &quot;to curse God&quot; with a euphemism -- motivated
no doubt by their fear of taking God's name in vain (see Exodus
20:7).
<P>
<B>VII. Conclusion </B>
<P>
The KJV was an acceptable translation in 1611; however, not only
has the English language changed substantially, but our understanding
of the original languages and the textual evidence has improved
to such an extent that in point of fact, the KJV is currently
one of the worst translations available. It is difficult for the
modern reader to understand, it contains numerous errors, and
it is very weak on the doctrine of the Trinity.
<P>
No translation is perfect; all are produced by fallible humans.
Only God's word in the original manuscripts in Hebrew, Aramaic,
and Greek were flawless.
<P>
Unfortunately, the originals are no longer in existence. However,
through the science of textual criticism the original word of
God has been substantially restored.
<P>
And it should be borne in mind that in over 90% of the passages
in the Bible there are no differences between the various texts.
