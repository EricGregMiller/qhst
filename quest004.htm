<B>How many non-biblical books are mentioned in the Bible and
what are they?</B><HR>

<P>
The Bible is clear that some of its authors made use of outside
sources. Luke is very general, and doesn't name his source documents
(Luke 1:1-3); however, comparison between him, Matthew and Mark
demonstrate that he clearly made use of Mark, as did Matthew,
for that matter. Other points of comparison between Matthew and
Luke have lead scholars to the conclusion that they both made
use of another source document, thus far undiscovered, which is
called, for convenience, Q (from the German word <I>quelle</I>,
meaning source.)
<P>
Jude quotes from two Apocryphal books, The Book of Enoch in vs.
14 and The Assumption of Moses in vs. 9. Paul quotes from several
Greek writers. In Acts 17:28 we see him using Aratus; in 1 Corinthians
15:8 he quotes from Menander and in Titus 1:12 he quotes from
Epimenides.

Unsurprisingly, the corpus of Hebrew literature consisted of much
more than what we call the Old Testament. The ancient Israelites
were no different than the people of today who produce reams of
literature, history, songs, and poetry. But not everything they
produced was scripture. It is peculiar that anyone would be surprised
by this.
<P>
Most of the literature, poetry, and historical annals mentioned
in the OT have not,<B> </B>unfortunately, come down to us today.
There is an extensive body of Jewish literature dating from about
400 BC through about 200 BC that is remarkable and interesting;
parts are what are called the Apocrypha, which the Roman Catholic
church has accepted on a par with the rest of the OT, though only
since the Council of Trent in 1546. This was in reaction to Protestantism's
explicit rejection of them as Scripture. Until then, they had
been considered useful for teaching, but were not held in quite
as high regard as the rest of scripture. Protestantism and Judaism
have been universal in rejecting them as scripture. <HR>
