<P>
<B>The Book of Deuteronomy</B> 
<P>
<B>I. Title </B>
<P>
The English title comes from the Greek translation of the Old
Testament (the Septuagint), meaning &quot;second law&quot;. This
is a misnomer, as it implies that this book contains another or
different law, which it does not. In Hebrew, the book's title
is taken from the first words in the book, <I>eleh devarim</I>--
which mean &quot;these are the words&quot;.
<P>
<B>II. Author </B>
<P>
Moses is traditionally assumed to be the author of the book of
Deuteronomy. Please see the discussion at the beginning of <A HREF="gen.htm">Genesis</A>
for more information.

<B>IV. Vassal Treaties </B>
<P>
The format of Deuteronomy follows the structure of Ancient Near
Eastern treaties which were made between greater and lesser powers.
Israel, the lesser power, had been freed from bondage as Egypt's
vassal and was now voluntarily becoming the vassal of Yahweh.
Therefore, the book of Deuteronomy is a treaty or contract between
God and Israel.
