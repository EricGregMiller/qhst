	1. <B> Course Objectives:</B>  The objective of this course is to provide the student with a basic understanding of Ancient Hebrew grammar,  and to build a foundation for further study of the Hebrew Bible.<P>
	2.  <B>WARNING:</B>  A little knowledge is a DANGEROUS thing.  The student should be warned in advance that completion of this course will NOT make him or her an expert in Hebrew.  It will, however, give one the ability to translate simple sentences.  For more advanced ability the student MUST pursue further studies.<P>

	3. <B> Method:</B>  The student will be required to complete, and submit for evaluation ALL assignments made in this course.  These assignments will be graded, and the student will receive those grades.  Grading is an important part of the learning experience.  It helps the instructor know where more reinforcement is needed, and it helps the student know areas of weakness and areas that need improvement.<P>

	4. <B> Materials:</B>  In addition to Internet Explorer or Netscape and a Hebrew font (see above) the student will need to purchase the following books:<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>Biblica Hebraica Stutgartensia</I>.  <br>
 Brown, Driver, Briggs. <I>Hebrew-English Lexicon</I>.  Various publishers<br>
	Menahem Mansoor. <I> Biblical Hebrew Step-by-Step</I>. Baker Books.<P></BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Books are available from <a href="amazon.htm">The Campus Bookstore</a>.<P></B>

	5. <B>Remarks: </B> Finally, do not be overwhelmed or frightened off by the subject matter or the apparent "strangeness" of the material.  Stick it out, and the rewards will be immeasurable.  Take one step at a time, do not move to the next lesson until you are certain that you have mastered all of the previous ones, and remember that taking Hebrew is like eating a cow: it can only be done one hamburger at a time, but eventually you will finish the whole thing!<P>
