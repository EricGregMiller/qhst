Richard N. Longnecker writes:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;The Acts of the Apostles&quot; is the name given to the
second part of a two-volume work traditionally identified as having
been written by Luke, a companion of the apostle Paul. Originally
the two volumes circulated together as two parts of one complete
writing. But during the late first or early second century, the
first volume became associated with the Gospels identified with
Matthew, Mark, and John, thus forming the fourfold Gospel. Luke's
second volume was left to go its own way. It was at this time,
it seems, that the second volume received its present title, with
the word &quot;Acts&quot; (<I>praxeis</I>) evidently meant to
suggest both movement in the advance of the gospel and heroic
exploits by the apostles. The reference to &quot;the Apostles,&quot;
however, is somewhat misleading, because the work deals almost
exclusively with Peter and Paul and the persons and events associated
with their ministries.&quot; (Richard N. Longnecker. <I>The Expositor's
Bible Commentary. The Acts of the Apostles</I>. Grand Rapids:
Zondervan, 1981, p. 207).

The author of the book of Acts has traditionally been assumed
to be Luke. Luke was a gentile, a physician, and a companion of
Paul. For more on the issue of authorship, see the discussion
in the book of Luke.

Acts is the third longest book in the New Testament. It is about
one- tenth shorter than Luke which is the longest book in the
New Testament; it is just a very tiny fraction shorter than Matthew.
Together, Luke and Acts make up about thirty percent of the material
in the New Testament, more than the writings of either Paul or
John.
<P>
It is important to point out that without the book of Acts, there
would be no record at all of the history of the early church.
All that is known about the beginnings of the early church, except
for what little can be gleaned from Paul's letters and the letters
of a few others, comes from this work by Luke. Acts is unique
in what it records, which is the early history of Christianity,
from about AD 33 until about AD 63. It's date, therefore, is probably
around AD 64 (Paul's imprisonment in Rome was from AD 61-63).
