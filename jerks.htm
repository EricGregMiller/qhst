How often does it happen that a religious person does something
reprehensible and suddenly all the members of that religion are
evil and perhaps religion itself is evil and responsible for all
the suffering that Earth has ever endured? Doubtless we have heard
coworkers, columnists, and letter writers espousing such opinions
for years.
<P>
Why do some people have this response? Simple human nature. We
are almost all guilty of this way of thinking, in some context
or another. If a person of an ethnicity, profession, or religion
we despise does something jerklike we will of course notice it
and record it as one more example of how bad that ethnicity, profession,
or religion is. On the other hand, if a person who does not belong
to the hated group does the same jerklike thing, we fail to notice
it. Likewise, if a member of the hated group does something remarkably
unjerklike, we won't notice that either. Only evidence that confirms
our preconceived thought will enter our brains and take up permanent
residence. (This also occurs with superstition. You tell me you
know someone who broke a chain letter and they keeled over the
next day Interesting, perhaps, but that someone died after breaking
a chain letter does not prove a cause and effect relationship.
It's like the old joke about the guy wearing garlic to keep the
vampires away. &quot;How silly&quot;, we say, but he points out
that he hasn't been bothered by vampires in years.)
<P>
This is simple human nature. It's precisely why the scientific
method was developed: to help us overcome the tendency for confirmatory
or anecdotal evidence to carry excessive weight.
<P>
So, shouldn't we simply label as &quot;jerk&quot; an individual
who is one, who uses his religion to justify his despicable behavior,
rather than imagine that that religion was somehow guilty by association?
I mean, how much bigger proof do you need of someone's status
as &quot;jerk&quot; than the simple fact that he or she tried
to justify his actions by claiming he was only doing what God
told him to do?
<P>
Worse, if we condemn a religion, then we're taking the testimony
of an obvious jerk that he is a legitimate spokesperson for that
religion. Doesn't this strike anyone else as screwy? I'm going
to take the word of a murderer that he can really give me profound
insight into deep theological truth? Do I have &quot;stupid&quot;
written on my forehead?
<P>
Do we really agree with the assassin of Yitzak Rabin when he claims
his murder of the Prime Minister of Israel was justified by the
Torah? Do we actually agree with the suicide bomber who believes
the Koran really teaches that the killing of innocents serves
God? Were the Crusades of the Middle Ages truly consistent with
the teachings of Christ?
<P>
I don't think so.
<P>
So let's acknowledge that the world has jerks in it and that part
of the definition of &quot;jerk&quot; is anyone who justifies
his evil by daring to claim &quot;God told me to do it; look,
it's right here in the book.&quot;
