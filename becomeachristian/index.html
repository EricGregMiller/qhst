<B>All people are sinners by birth.  
<P>
<img border=0 src="../graphix/book-small.gif" align=left>Psalms 51:5</b> Surely I was sinful at birth, sinful from the time my mother conceived
me.
<br><hr size-1 noshade color="#000080"> 

<B>Consequently, since it is our nature to sin, there is nothing
we can do to stop sinning, anymore than we could stop breathing. 

<P>
<img border=0 src="../graphix/book-small.gif" align=left>Romans 3:10-12</b> As it is written There is no one righteous, not even one;
there is no one who understands, no one who seeks God. All have
turned away, they have together become worthless; there is no
one who does good, not even one. 

 
<br><hr size-1 noshade color="#000080">   
<B>Therefore, God had to take care of the problem.  
<P>
<img border=0 src="../graphix/book-small.gif" align=left>Isaiah 63:5</b> 
I looked, but there was no one to help, I was appalled that no
one gave support; so my own arm worked salvation for me, and my
own wrath sustained me.
<P>
<img border=0 src="../graphix/book-small.gif" align=left><B>Isaiah 43:11</b> I, even I, am the LORD, and apart from me there is no savior.
 
<br><hr size-1 noshade color="#000080">   

<B>He did this, by sending his son, Jesus Christ, to die on the
cross for the sins of humanity.  
<P>
<img border=0 src="../graphix/book-small.gif" align=left>Romans 5:7-10</b> Very rarely will anyone die for a righteous man, though for a
good man someone might possibly dare to die. But God demonstrates
his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ
died for us. Since we have now been justified by his blood, how
much more shall we be saved from God's wrath through him! For
if, when we were God's enemies, we were reconciled to him through
the death of his Son, how much more, having been reconciled, shall
we be saved through his life!

 
<br><hr size-1 noshade color="#000080">   

<B>If we decide to accept the gift of his death, and turn our
lives over to God, then he puts his Holy Spirit inside us, making
us Christians. Becoming a Christian is entirely the work of God;
we do not contribute to it ourselves. No amount of being good
will make a person a Christian, because being good has nothing
to do with it.  
<P>
<img border=0 src="../graphix/book-small.gif" align=left>Galatians 3:1-5</b> You foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you? Before your very
eyes Jesus Christ was clearly portrayed as crucified. I would
like to learn just one thing from you Did you receive the Spirit
by observing the law, or by believing what you heard? Are you
so foolish? After beginning with the Spirit, are you now trying
to attain your goal by human effort? Have you suffered so much
for nothing -- if it really was for nothing? Does God give you
his Spirit and work miracles among you because you observe the
law, or because you believe what you heard?
<P>
<img border=0 src="../graphix/book-small.gif" align=left><B>Ephesians 2:8-9</b> For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith -- and this
not from yourselves, it is the gift of God -- not by works, so
that no one can boast.

 
<br><hr size-1 noshade color="#000080">   

<B>Becoming a Christian results inevitably and automatically in
obedience to Christ. The first act of obedience is baptism --
being immersed in water -- to signify to friends and family that
one has died and been buried with Christ, raised to live a new
life in Him.  
<P>
<img border=0 src="../graphix/book-small.gif" align=left>Ephesians 2:10</b> For we are God's workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good
works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.
<P>
<img border=0 src="../graphix/book-small.gif" align=left><B>Acts 2:41</b> Those who accepted his message were baptized, and about three
thousand were added to their number that day.
 
<br><hr size-1 noshade color="#000080">   
<B>Good works are the consequence of becoming a Christian, not
the cause. But the good works that are done are the work of God
through the Christian, not the Christian's own efforts. Therefore
there is no place for pride or self-righteousness.  
<P>
<img border=0 src="../graphix/book-small.gif" align=left>Galatians 6:14</b> May I never boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ,
through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the
world.
<P>
<img border=0 src="../graphix/book-small.gif" align=left><B>Romans 3:27-28</b> Where, then, is boasting? It is excluded. On what principle? On
that of observing the law? No, but on that of faith. For we maintain
that a man is justified by faith apart from observing the law.
<P>
<img border=0 src="../graphix/book-small.gif" align=left><B>Galatians 2:20-21</b> I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ
lives in me. The life I live in the body, I live by faith in the
Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me. I do not set
aside the grace of God, for if righteousness could be gained through
the law, Christ died for nothing!
