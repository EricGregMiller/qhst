<b>3. Apocalyptic Between the Testaments</b>
<P>
  <blockquote>a. Enoch</blockquote>
<P>
 Having examined a couple of Old Testament texts of the apocalyptic
genre, we can now move on to a discussion of this literature in
the intertestamental period.
<P>
 Our first text is the Ethiopic book of Enoch, chapter 85.  It
is an excellent example of apocalyptic literature.  As this text
is not widely accessible then I have offered it below.
<P>
<blockquote>I Enoch 85
<P>
<B>1,2 And after this I saw another dream, and I will show the
whole dream to thee, my son. And Enoch lifted up (his voice) and
spake to his son Methuselah: ' To thee, my son, will I speak:
hear my words-incline thine ear to the dream-vision of thy father.
Before I took thy mother Edna, I saw in a vision on my bed, and
behold a bull came forth from the earth, and that bull was white;
and after it came forth a heifer, and along with this (latter)
came forth two bulls, one of them black and 4 the other red. And
that black bull gored the red one and pursued him over the earth,
and thereupon 5 I could no longer see that red bull. But that
black bull grew and that heifer went with him, and 6 I saw that
many oxen proceeded from him which resembled and followed him.
And that cow, that first one, went from the presence of that first
bull in order to seek that red one, but found him 7 not, and lamented
with a great lamentation over him and sought him. And I looked
till that first 8 bull came to her and quieted her, and from that
time onward she cried no more. And after that she bore another
white bull, and after him she bore many bulls and black cows.
  9 And I saw in my sleep that white bull likewise grow and become
a great white bull, and from Him proceeded many white bulls, and
they resembled him. And they began to beget many white bulls,
which resembled them, one following the other, (even) many.</B></blockquote>

 The animal imagery should be fairly familiar to readers of the
Bible.  In fact, this imagery plays a great part in Christian
apocalypses of a later era.  Of the many non-canonical writings,
I Enoch is perhaps the most investigated.  It is the subject of
research because it is the fertile ground from which much later
thought sprung.  Thus, for a few minutes we will discuss the book
and its purpose.
<P>
 Enoch was originally composed in Aramaic by an apocalyptic seer.
 It was added to over a very long period of time.  Thus, the earliest
pa   ssages (Ch 12-16, 91:1 during the years before the Maccabean
era while chapters 1-5 were added at the end of the compositional
time-frame just before the dawn of the Christian era.  The segment
which concerns us, chapter 85, was composed between 165 and 161
BCE.  What is of interest to readers of the New Testament is that
Enoch is quoted by Jude.<P>
<P>
<blockquote>b. Treatise of Shem</blockquote>
<P>
 This document is interesting as apocalyptic because it draws
on zodiacal symbolism in order to communicate the secrets of God.
  The treatise contains twelve chapters, one for each sign of
the zodiac.  The text of this document originated in the first
century before Christ, but the common text used today is a fifteenth
century syriac manuscript found in the John Rylands library at
Manchester.
<P>
 This is a significant text for Christians because it has bearing
on the interpretation of Matthew 2.   A brief excerpt is given
below.  This excerpt is chapter 9.
<P>
<blockquote><B>And if the year begins in Sagittarius: everyone whose name
contains a B or a P will have misery and a severe disease, and
in the beginning of the year it will increase in severity.  And
men in many places will be troubled.  And in the land of Egypt
there will be sown only a very little.  And in the middle of the
year there will be much rain.  But men will gather produce into
granaries because of the drought.  And grain will not be pleasing.
 Even at the end of the year it will not be good.  But wine and
oil will be considered good.  And adultery will increase and small
cattle will die.</B></blockquote>
<P>
 The interesting thing about these jewish astrological texts from
the period of the birth of the church is that they show that Judaism
was experimenting with theories and ideas not only not found in
the Old Testament, but absolutely forbidden by it.  Nevertheless,
the apocalypticists were interested in foretelling the future
so that their audiences would have some sense of hope.  We will
next examine the Qumran community and its apocalyptic ideas.
