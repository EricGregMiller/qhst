&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Quartz Hill School of Theology recognizes that students and faculty
cannot be coerced into some pre-set doctrinal mode. Each student
and faculty member must be free to pursue and publish his ideas
in whatever forum or manner that his conscience may dictate. No
student or faculty member should fear or suffer discipline based
solely on what ideas or theological concepts he holds.
