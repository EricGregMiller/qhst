<B>Introduction</B> 
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Antelope Valley Press reports that during the 1990's inflation
has averaged only about three percent annually. Yet, there is
one segment of the economy where inflation rages out of control:
higher education.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Economic reports regularly reaffirm the fact that college graduates
make substantially more money than people without degrees, making
higher education a definite attraction. However, the reality is
that college costs are soaring so high that they are beyond the
reach of many high school graduates and older adults.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For instance, the University of California and California State
University limited 1994's fee increases to ten percent -- more
than three times the rate of inflation. One year at UCLA now costs
in excess of $4000.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Many private schools in California and across the nation cost
$20,000 or more per year. The vast majority of middle-class families
cannot afford $80,000 for four years of college.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A new law now makes it possible for student loans to be stretched out to
thirty years, instead of ten, making the monthly payments considerably
less. That may help many young people, but they should be aware
that they will still be paying off their intellectual indebtedness
when they are in their fifties!
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Quartz Hill School of Theology deplores this abominable situation;
not only is relying upon the students for operating expenses unduly
burdensome to the students, it creates problems for the institution
as well. There is a tendency to begin looking at students, not
as people, but as stacks of dollar bills. The result, too often,
is that an institution will lower standards, inflate grades, and
do back flips in order to retain these money stacks.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The administration and faculty of Quartz Hill School of Theology
have decided that there has to be a better way to operate. Therefore,
we charge students only fifty dollars per unit.
We firmly believe that by keeping costs low and relying on volunteer
help, we can raise adequate funds to operate through our fundraising and the occasional donations, rather than by standing
on the backs of our students.<P>
<H2>Internal (on campus students): </H2>

<P>
<B>Basic Fee:</B> $50.00 per unit, per class.
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A typical full load of five classes (totaling fifteen quarter
units) would cost $750.00 per quarter. Fees may be paid in full
or in monthly installments.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A discount of $5.00 per class taken the following quarter will
be awarded to the student who achieves a 3.8 grade point average
or better for the classes taken in the immediately preceding quarter.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Students must pay according to their ability. If a student is
unable to pay, he or she will be granted a QHST Scholarship and may attend for free. In
order to keep the Scholarship, the student must demonstrate a
serious intent to gain an education and maintain a reasonable
grade point average.  Remember, our primary philosophy is that finances should never stand in the way of someone getting an education.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Students on Scholarship should review their finances each quarter
to determine if they should remain on the Scholarship.<p>
<H2>External (on-line courses): </H2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<B>Basic Fee:</B> $50.00 per class.
<p>
<B>Possible Additional Fees:</B>
<P>
<i>Video Tapes (VHS format)</i>: $15.00 per quarter, per class.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;An average class will consist of 3 video cassettes with six hours
per tape.
<br>
<i>Books</i>: average will be about $50.00 per quarter, per class.
<br>
<i>Postage</i>: average will be about $7.50 per quarter.</blockquote>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All fees must be paid in advance.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;No scholarships or any other discounts are available for External
Studies' Students, since all the courses are freely available as shareware, with payment asked for only if the student wishes to receive academic credit.
<P>
<B>Refunds</B> 
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A refund of fees paid will be made only if a class is dropped
within the first week of instruction. For External Studies' Students,
no refund of postage costs will be made; refund for books and
video cassettes will be contingent upon their return in good condition.
