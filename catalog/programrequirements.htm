<b>Program Requirements</b>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To enter the Master's program a student must have completed a
Bachelor's Degree or its equivalent. It is recommended that the
student have an undergraduate degree in Bible, with a strong emphasis
on Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek. To graduate with a Master's the
student must have a total of at least three years of Hebrew and
Greek and one year of Aramaic.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Students who transfer to Quartz Hill School of Theology without
this language background will be required to make up the deficit
by taking the necessary Hebrew, Greek and Aramaic classes.
