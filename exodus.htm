The English title comes from the Greek translation of the Old

from the first words in the book, <I>eleh shemot</I> -- which mean &quot;these
are the names&quot;.
<P>
<B>II. Author</B>
<P>
Moses is traditionally assumed to be the author of the book of
Exodus. Please see the discussion at the beginning of <A HREF="gen.htm">Genesis</A>
