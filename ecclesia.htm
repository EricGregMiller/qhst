<B>Introduction</B>
<P>
 The book of Ecclesiastes (<I>Qoheleth</I> in Hebrew) is one of the most
important books in the Old Testament.  The book is seldom read
and often misunderstood.  For this reason we will now take it
upon ourselves to examine the text and reap the excellent message
it has to bear.   The key to understanding the book is understanding
the historical situation which gave rise to it.   Without this
historical sense the book becomes quite inexplicable.  Its message
is lost if its setting is forgotten.
<P>
 The third century BCE in Palestine was a period of intensive
cultural struggle.  The Greeks had taken charge of the Ancient
Near East after their victory over the Persians.  As Judea was
a part of the Persian empire it also become a part of the new
Greek hegemony.  When the Greeks arrived they brought their habits
and customs with them, as well as their theology.
<P>
 The way that the ancient Greeks viewed the gods was in diametric
opposition to the Hebraic conception of God.  For the Greeks,
the gods were distant, unconcerned, and essentially bad and capricious.
 The Hebrew view of God was exactly the opposite.  The Greek view
was, interestingly enough, adopted by some of the leading people
of Judea and the culture wars began.
<P>
 The Greeks also brought with them the idea that the human intellect
was all powerful.  Reason was exalted above every other human
faculty, and above the gods as well.   Into this atmosphere the
book of Ecclesiastes was given life.
<P>
 The purpose of the book is to show the utter futility of living life without
God, on the basis of reason alone.  Thus, Ecclesiastes speaks of the
futility of life; but what must be read between the lines is that life is
futile only when God is left out of account.  The key to the book is found
in the last chapter when the reader is reminded to put God first in life.
<P>
 In brief, we can reconstruct the birth of the book in the following
way:  in Judea in the third century before Christ the Greek idea
that reason is all powerful began to take hold.  With your mind,
the Greeks taught, you can solve any problem and find any answer.
 Some of the Jewish people adopted this idea and others rejected
it.  One of those who rejected it was a fellow who called himself
Qoheleth.  Qoheleth put pen to paper and wrote the book later
called Ecclesiastes in order to combat the idea that reason is
all powerful.  He addressed his book to those agnostics of his
day (and ours) who suppose that the human mind is capable of answering
the most pressing questions of life.  So, he takes their side
(and plays the devil's advocate) by suggesting that if they are
right, then life is terribly futile.
<P>
 At the end of his treatise he exposes the truth and maintains
that the whole book has been a sharp attack on those who disregard
God.  The modern reader must thus know that between every line
of text the underlying message is &quot;without God&quot; life
is vanity, work is vanity, truth is ephemeral, and death is a
joke.  Thus, when we read the first verse, &quot;Vanity of vanities,
all is vanity&quot; we must immediately supply &quot;without God&quot;.
 And so we must do the same throughout the book.  Only then will
we properly comprehend the message of the book.
<P>
 Now, it must be swiftly said that the writer of the book is not
opposed to human reason- for reason too is a gift of God.  What
the writer opposes is the exaltation of reason above and apart
from God.
<P>
 The book has traditionally been ascribed to Solomon.  This is,
however, quite unlikely.  The language of the book, the descriptions
included within it, and the fact that the text nowhere says that
Solomon is the author are decisive in bringing us to the conclusion
that Solomon was not the author of the book.  Why would the author
describe himself as &quot;king of Jerusalem&quot;?  Simply as
a literary device.  Nothing more and nothing less.
<P>
 Who then did write it?  In my estimation it was written by a
sage in third century BCE Judea who saw the decay brought about
by Greek culture on Judean religion and who then wrote the book
as a protest against that decay.  The writer did not wish his
people to be mislead into thinking that reason could replace God
-- so he wrote a book to those who were headed done the path of
agnosticism.  He used reason to show that reason does not have
all the answers, or even most of them; that without God life is
indeed futile.
<P>
 Finally, as a note on the procedure we will follow, the text
of Ecclesiastes is given below and the verses are commented on
immediately after they are given; either separately or in a group.
<P>
<B>ASSIGNEMENT:</B>  Read the book of Ecclesiastes in your Bible.  Then
read the commentary on Ecclesiastes by R.B.Y. Scott.
<P>
<B>LECTURE </B>
<P>
<B>Chapter  1</B>
<P>
<B>1 The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.</B>
<P>
On this verse see the introduction on the authorship of the text.
<P>
 
<P>
<B>2 Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher; vanity of vanities,
all is vanity. </B>
<P>
Without God!  When God is absent and humans believe themselves
to be self sufficient all is indeed vain.
<P>
<B>3 What profit hath man of all his labor wherein he laboreth
under the sun? </B>
<P>
<B>4 One generation goeth, and another generation cometh; but
the earth abideth for ever. </B>
<P>
<B>5 The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth
to its place where it ariseth. </B>
<P>
<B>6 The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the
north; it turneth about continually in its course, and the wind
returneth again to its circuits. </B>
<P>
<B>7 All the rivers run into the sea, yet the sea is not full;
unto the place whither the rivers go, thither they go again.</B>
<P>
   In these verses we God is simply an endless cycle of useless
repetition.
<P>
 
<P>
<B>8 All things are full of weariness; man cannot utter it: the
eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.
</B>
<P>
<B>9 That which hath been is that which shall be; and that which
hath been done is that which shall be done: and there is no new
thing under the sun. </B>
<P>
Not only is life without God futile, it is also extraordinarily
empty.
<P>
<B>10 Is there a thing whereof it may be said, See, this is new?
it hath been long ago, in the ages which were before us. </B>
<P>
<B>11 There is no remembrance of the former generations; neither
shall there be any remembrance of the latter generations that
are to come, among those that shall come after. </B>
<P>
And even if we suppose that we are doing something new and useful,
we may rest assured that we are simply repeating what has already
been done many times.  Thus, without God, even our inventiveness
is shallow and silly.
<P>
<B>12 I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem. </B>
<P>
The noun &quot;king&quot; can also be translated &quot;ruler,
instructor&quot;.  Thus it is not necessary to say that the writer
was a king -- it is also possible to translate with &quot;I, Qoheleth,
was an instructor in Jerusalem&quot;.  This not only fits in with
the first verse, but it also rescues us from the incorrect idea
that Solomon was the author of the book.
<P>
<B>13 And I applied my heart to seek and to search out by wisdom
concerning all that is done under heaven: it is a sore travail
that God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised therewith.
</B>
<P>
<B>14 I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and,
behold, all is vanity and a striving after wind. </B>
<P>
<B>15 That which is crooked cannot be made straight; and that
which is wanting cannot be numbered. </B>
<P>
<B>16 I communed with mine own hear, saying, Lo, I have gotten
me great wisdom abo   ve all that were beforrt hath had great
experience of wisdom and knowledge. </B>
<P>
<B>17 And I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness
and folly: I perceived that this also was a striving after wind.
</B>
<P>
<B>18 For in much wisdom is much grief; and he that increaseth
knowledge increaseth sorrow. </B>
<P>
These verses show that, once again, when God is not taken into
account the whole of life is a futile effort of self improvement
or societal improvement.  Wisdom, riches, knowledge, are all empty
without God.
<P>
<B>Chapter 2</B>
<P>
<B>1 I said in my heart, Come now, I will prove thee with mirth;
therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also was vanity. </B>
<P>
Life can be pleasurable only for those who know God.  For those
who exalt reason and thereby neglect God, or make God into a God
of the gaps who need only be called into account when problems
become unanswerable, then life is a horrid series of miseries.
<P>
<B>2 I said of laughter, It is mad; and of mirth, What doeth it?
</B>
<P>
<B>3 I searched in my heart how to cheer my flesh with wine, my
heart yet guiding me with wisdom, and how to lay hold on folly,
till I might see what it was good for the sons of men that they
should do under heaven all the days of their life. </B>
<P>
<B>4 I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me
vineyards; </B>
<P>
<B>5 I made me gardens and parks, and I planted trees in them
of all kinds of fruit; </B>
<P>
<B>6 I made me pools of water, to water therefrom the forest where
trees were reared; </B>
<P>
<B>7 I bought men-servants and maid-servants, and had servants
born in my house; also I had great possessions of herds and flocks,
above all that were before me in Jerusalem; </B>
<P>
<B>8 I gathered me also silver and gold, and the treasure of kings
and of the provinces; I gat me men-singers and women-singers,
and the delights of the sons of men, musical instruments, and
that of all sorts. </B>
<P>
<B>9 So I was great, and increased more than all that were before
me in Jerus   alem: also my wisdom rhatsoever mine eyes desired
I kept not from them; I withheld not my heart from any joy; for
my heart rejoiced because of all my labor; and this was my portion
from all my labor. </B>
<P>
<B>11 Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought,
and on the labor that I had labored to do; and, behold, all was
vanity and a striving after wind, and there was no profit under
the sun. </B>
<P>
The struggles of human life are bitter-sweet.  Some times are
good and others are bad.  Labor is both pleasant and difficult.
 Yet all of life's labor is tempered by the certain knowledge
that death is slowly making its entrance on the stage.  Each year
that we live we grow closer to that encounter which none can avoid.
 So, if life is only one dimensional- that is, if life is only
for the here and now, then it surely is madness and folly, for
life without God goes nowhere.  So, Qoheleth says by implication,
those of you who exalt human reason above God, what will you say
to this?  How will you resolve this dilemma that we call the quest
for the meaning of life?
<P>
<B>12 And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly:
for what can the man do that cometh after the king? even that
which hath been done long ago. </B>
<P>
<B>13 Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light
excelleth darkness. </B>
<P>
<B>14 The wise man's eyes are in his head, and the fool walketh
in darkness: and yet I perceived that one event happeneth to them
all. </B>
<P>
<B>15 Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so
will it happen even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then
said I in my heart, that this also is vanity. </B>
<P>
<B>16 For of the wise man, even as of the fool, there is no remembrance
for ever; seeing that in the days to come all will have been long
forgotten. And how doth the wise man die even as the fool! </B>
<P>
So, wisdom does not bring joy but despair.  For despair is the
only fruit one can pluck from the tree of arrogance.  The fool
   lives with no thought minence of death, but the wise man is
cursed with the knowledge that he will soon die!  So who is better
off if both forget God?
<P>
<B>17 So I hated life, because the work that is wrought under
the sun was grievous unto me; for all is vanity and a striving
after wind. </B>
<P>
<B>18 And I hated all my labor wherein I labored under the sun,
seeing that I must leave it unto the man that shall be after me.
</B>
<P>
What utter despair!  If one reads this without the interpretive
key discussed in the introduction to this course than one can
see why this book is avoided.  But if one rightly grasps the significance
of the book then nothing than this could be truer.  For those
who live without God do hate life- that is why they try to destroy
themselves with drugs, alcohol, unprotected sex, smoking and all
the other vices common in our day.  Life without God is indeed
an empty pursuit of nothingness.  This theme is replayed so often
in the book that it is rather like the chorus of a hymn or the
musical theme of an opera.
<P>
<B>19 And who knoweth whether he will be a wise man or a fool?
yet will he have rule over all my labor wherein I have labored,
and wherein I have showed myself wise under the sun. This also
is vanity. </B>
<P>
<B>20 Therefore I turned about to cause my heart to despair concerning
all the labor wherein I had labored under the sun. </B>
<P>
<B>21 For there is a man whose labor is with wisdom, and with
knowledge, and with skillfulness; yet to a man that hath not labored
therein shall he leave it for his portion. This also is vanity
and a great evil. </B>
<P>
<B>22 For what hath a man of all his labor, and of the striving
of his heart, wherein he laboreth under the sun? </B>
<P>
<B>23 For all his days are but sorrows, and his travail is grief;
yea, even in the night his heart taketh no rest. This also is
vanity. </B>
<P>
<B>24 There is nothing better for a man than that he should eat
and drink, and make his soul enjoy good in his labor. This also
   I saw, that it is fromf16 </B>
<P>
<B>So the writer concludes this segment by describing the utter
folly of an empty life.  If one lives without God one might as
well eat, and drink, and be as happy as possible- for when death
comes this all will end.</B>
<P>
<B>25 For who can eat, or who can have enjoyment, more than I?
</B>
<P>
<B>26 For to the man that pleaseth him God giveth wisdom, and
knowledge, and joy; but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather
and to heap up, that he may give to him that pleaseth God. This
also is vanity and a striving after wind. </B>
<P>
Verse 26 is the first hint towards the purpose of the book that
we have seen so far.  It is the first explicit mention of God
and it is the first description of the fact that it is in God
alone that joy can be found.  This theme is later hinted at again
(as we shall see) and it comes to full fruition only in the conclusion
of the book.
<P>
<B>Chapter 3</B>
<P>
<B>1 For everything there is a season, and a time for every purpose
under heaven: </B>
<P>
<B>2 a time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and
a time to pluck up that which is planted; </B>
<P>
<B>3 a time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down,
and a time to build up; </B>
<P>
<B>4 a time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and
a time to dance; </B>
<P>
<B>5 a time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together;
a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing; </B>
<P>
<B>6 a time to seek, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a
time to cast away; </B>
<P>
<B>7 a time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence,
and a time to speak; </B>
<P>
<B>8 a time to love, and a time to hate; a time for war, and a
time for peace. </B>
<P>
The human condition is characterized by boundaries.  There are
beginning points and ending points, and all points in between.
 And these boundaries are completely out of the control of human
beings.  Even those who exalt reason are forced into silence when
asked why people die when they do and why    they lose when they
doagainst one another.  Which is just the point Qoheleth wishes
to make.  It is only &quot;under heaven&quot; that life takes
on meaning.  That is, it is only when God gives life meaning that
it posseses any meaning.
<P>
<B>9 What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboreth?
</B>
<P>
<B>10 I have seen the travail which God hath given to the sons
of men to be exercised therewith. </B>
<P>
<B>11 He hath made everything beautiful in its time: also he hath
set eternity in their heart, yet so that man cannot find out the
work that God hath done from the beginning even to the end. </B>
<P>
By placing eternity in the human heart God has made it quite impossible
for people to have joy without having Him.  It is only in God
that people find the real answers to their real questions.
<P>
<B>12 I know that there is nothing better for them, than to rejoice,
and to do good so long as they live. </B>
<P>
<B>13 And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy
good in all his labor, is the gift of God. </B>
<P>
<B>14 I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever:
nothing can be put to it, nor anything taken from it; and God
hath done it, that men should fear before him. </B>
<P>
<B>15 That which is hath been long ago; and that which is to be
hath long ago been: and God seeketh again that which is passed
away. </B>
<P>
These verses indicate once again that it is God, and not the human
capacity to understand, that gives life its significance.
<P>
<B>16 And moreover I saw under the sun, in the place of justice,
that wickedness was there; and in the place of righteousness,
that wickedness was there. </B>
<P>
<B>17 I said in my heart, God will judge the righteous and the
wicked; for there is a time there for every purpose and for every
work. </B>
<P>
<B>18 I said in my heart, It is because of the sons of men, that
God may prove them, and that they may see that they themselves
are but as beasts. </B>
<P>
<B>19 For that which befalleth the sons of me   n befalleth beasts;
evs the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one
breath; and man hath no preeminence above the beasts: for all
is vanity. </B>
<P>
<B>20 All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn
to dust again. </B>
<P>
<B>21 Who knoweth the spirit of man, whether it goeth upward,
and the spirit of the beast, whether it goeth downward to the
earth? </B>
<P>
<B>22 Wherefore I saw that there is nothing better, than that
a man should rejoice in his works; for that is his portion: for
who shall bring him back to see what shall be after him? </B>
<P>
Or, in other words, the refrain is repeated once more- for if
life is lived wihtout God then people really are animal like.
 Living only to eat, and eating only to live and reproduce so
that the DNA string can be passed down to other animal like humans
who live without God.  Small wonder that Qoheleth is thoroughly
convinced that such a life is indeed the greatest of all follies.
<P>
<B>Chapter 4</B>
<P>
<B>1 Then I returned and saw all the oppressions that are done
under the sun: and, behold, the tears of such as were oppressed,
and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors
there was power; but they had no comforter. </B>
<P>
<B>2 Wherefore I praised the dead that have been long dead more
than the living that are yet alive; </B>
<P>
<B>3 yea, better than them both did I esteem him that hath not
yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the
sun. </B>
<P>
<B>4 Then I saw all labor and every skilful work, that for this
a man is envied of his neighbor. This also is vanity and a striving
after wind. </B>
<P>
<B>5 The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh.
</B>
<P>
<B>6 Better is a handful, with quietness, than two handfuls with
labor and striving after wind. </B>
<P>
<B>7 Then I returned and saw vanity under the sun. </B>
<P>
Oppression, powerlessness, death, struggle, work, all of these
things simply make no sense whatsoever if God is ignored.  That
is, we understand life a little better when we understand that
f God and people on the side of evil.  There is oppression by
people because those people take no cognizanceof God.  Work is
a toilsome burden because folks without God have no goal except
self advancement.  God, if the center of existence, gives meaning
to life; but if God is left out life becomes a bestial struggle
for survival and conquest.
<P>
<B>8 There is one that is alone, and he hath not a second; yea,
he hath neither son nor brother; yet is there no end of all his
labor, neither are his eyes satisfied with riches. For whom then,
saith he, do I labor, and deprive my soul of good? This also is
vanity, yea, it is a sore travail. </B>
<P>
Those who live merely to acquire things will, at the end of their
lives, realize that they have worked for those who will neither
appreciate their sacrifice nor cherish their memory.
<P>
<B>9 Two are better than one, because they have a good reward
for their labor. </B>
<P>
<B>10 For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow; but woe
to him that is alone when he falleth, and hath not another to
lift him up. </B>
<P>
<B>11 Again, if two lie together, then they have warmth; but how
can one be warm alone? </B>
<P>
<B>12 And if a man prevail against him that is alone, two shall
withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken. </B>
<P>
Two are indeed better than one.  And one who loves God and serves
Him and takes account of Him is far better off than anyone who
does not.
<P>
<B>13 Better is a poor and wise youth than an old and foolish
king, who knoweth not how to receive admonition any more. </B>
<P>
<B>14 For out of prison he came forth to be king; yea, even in
his kingdom he was born poor. </B>
<P>
<B>15 I saw all the living that walk under the sun, that they
were with the youth, the second, that stood up in his stead. </B>
<P>
<B>16 There was no end of all the people, even of all them over
whom he was: yet they that come after shall not rejoice in him.
Surely this also is vanity and a st   riving after wind. dispensible.
 We will all be replaced as the wheel of time moves forward and
rolls over us.  So it is also with those whose reason is exalted
by them above God.  From birth till death, life without God is
empty.</B>
<P>
<B>Chapter 5</B>
<P>
<B>1 Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God; for to
draw nigh to hear is better than to give the sacrifice of fools:
for they know not that they do evil. </B>
<P>
<B>2 Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thy heart be hasty
to utter anything before God; for God is in heaven, and thou upon
earth: therefore let thy words be few. </B>
<P>
<B>3 For a dream cometh with a multitude of business, and a fool's
voice with a multitude of words. </B>
<P>
<B>4 When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for
he hath no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou vowest. </B>
<P>
<B>5 Better is it that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou
shouldest vow and not pay. </B>
<P>
<B>6 Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say
thou before the angel, that is was an error: wherefore should
God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thy hands?
</B>
<P>
<B>7 For in the multitude of dreams there are vanities, and in
many words: but fear thou God. </B>
<P>
Those who do take account of God ought to remember that He is
holy and glorious, and extremely worthy of adoration and adulation.
 They ought not treat God lightly or with little respect.  What
they say to God is taken seriously by Him.  When they sing such
songs as &quot;I have decided to follow Jesus&quot;, God takes
them seriously.  They might just be singing words but God is listening
to those words and taking them as a promise to himself.  When
one does &quot;speak before thinking&quot; in the presence of
God one is guilty of a grave offense; for God takes us seriously
whether we take Him seriously or not.
<P>
<B>8 If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and the violent
taking away of justice and righteousness in a province, marvel
not at the matter: for one hig   her than the high regaan they.
</B>
<P>
<B>9 Moreover the profit of the earth is for all: the king himself
is served by the field. </B>
<P>
Wealth, power, riches, authority; all these things do not necessarily
make one closer to God.  Even those who exalt reason and have
made themselves god have someone higher than themselves.  
<P>
<B>10 He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver;
nor he that loveth abundance, with increase: this also is vanity.
</B>
<P>
<B>11 When goods increase, they are increased that eat them; and
what advantage is there to the owner thereof, save the beholding
of them with his eyes? </B>
<P>
<B>12 The sleep of a laboring man is sweet, whether he eat little
or much; but the fulness of the rich will not suffer him to sleep.
</B>
<P>
<B>13 There is a grievous evil which I have seen under the sun,
namely, riches kept by the owner thereof to his hurt: </B>
<P>
<B>14 and those riches perish by evil adventure; and if he hath
begotten a son, there is nothing in his hand. </B>
<P>
<B>15 As he came forth from his mother's womb, naked shall he
go again as he came, and shall take nothing for his labor, which
he may carry away in his hand. </B>
<P>
<B>16 And this also is a grievous evil, that in all points as
he came, so shall he go: and what profit hath he that he laboreth
for the wind? </B>
<P>
The fact that many people live for money, and have made money
into a god which they heartily worship, is a problem that is not
modern.  It has been around as long as money has been around.
 But, the person who loves God cannot love money quite so much.
 Yet that is the very heart of the problem- for those who love
money have no room left for God in their hearts.  It is a great
evil that people live for money and die for money and yet money
is not able to be of any benefit to them when they really need
it.  They may work for it all their lives, but they will not have
its companionship in death.  In death they leave it all behind.
 How unfortunate, then, that those who exalt reas   on are not
intelligentapart from God is more harmful than helpful.
<P>
<B>17 All his days also he eateth in darkness, and he is sore
vexed, and hath sickness and wrath. </B>
<P>
<B>18 Behold, that which I have seen to be good and to be comely
is for one to eat and to drink, and to enjoy good in all his labor,
wherein he laboreth under the sun, all the days of his life which
God hath given him: for this is his portion. </B>
<P>
<B>19 Every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth,
and hath given him power to eat thereof, and to take his portion,
and to rejoice in his labor--this is the gift of God. </B>
<P>
<B>20 For he shall not much remember the days of his life; because
God answereth him in the joy of his heart. </B>
<P>
Once again, it is joy that is the gift of God.  With God life
is meaningful; and without God life is miserable.
<P>
<B>Chapter 6</B>
<P>
<B>1 There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it
is heavy upon men: </B>
<P>
<B>2 a man to whom God giveth riches, wealth, and honor, so that
he lacketh nothing for his soul of all that he desireth, yet God
giveth him not power to eat thereof, but an alien eateth it; this
is vanity, and it is an evil disease. </B>
<P>
<B>3 If a man beget a hundred children, and live many years, so
that the days of his years are many, but his soul be not filled
with good, and moreover he have no burial; I say, that an untimely
birth is better than he: </B>
<P>
<B>4 for it cometh in vanity, and departeth in darkness, and the
name thereof is covered with darkness; </B>
<P>
<B>5 moreover it hath not seen the sun nor known it; this hath
rest rather than the other: </B>
<P>
<B>6 yea, though he live a thousand years twice told, and yet
enjoy no good, do not all go to one place? </B>
<P>
<B>7 All the labor of man is for his mouth, and yet the appetite
is not filled. </B>
<P>
These verses are quite simple to explain; for they are simply
self explanatory.  Those who live for the belly die by the belly.
 That is, those who live to satisfy their appetites really
live for nothing.<P>

<B>8 For what advantage hath the wise more than the fool?
or what hath the poor man, that knoweth how to walk before the
living? 
<P>
9 Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire:
this also is vanity and a striving after wind. 
<P>
10 Whatsoever hath been, the name thereof was given long ago;
and it is know what man is; neither can he contend with him that
is mightier than he. 
<P>
11 Seeing there are many things that increase vanity, what is
man the better? 
<P>
12 For who knoweth what is good for man in his life, all the days
of his vain life which he spendeth as a shadow? for who can tell
a man what shall be after him under the sun? </B>
<P>
Life without God is like this!  It is empty and futile and hopeless
and void and any other horrid adjective one can think of.  Yet
this is what the days and nights of the godless are filled with;
pondering the utter meaninglessness of their lives.  This must,
surely, inspire the people of God to share the good news of God's
love with such loveless and forsaken folk!  They are scattered
abroad as sheep having no shepherd.  They are, by their own decision,
without the one and only source of real life.  So they must be
told!
<P>
<B>Chapter 7</B>
<P>
<B>1 A good name is better than precious oil; and the day of death,
than the day of one's birth. </B>
<P>
<B>2 It is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to
the house of feasting: for that is the end of all men; and the
living will lay it to his heart. </B>
<P>
<B>3 Sorrow is better than laughter; for by the sadness of the
countenance the heart is made glad. </B>
<P>
<B>4 The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the
heart of fools is in the house of mirth.</B>
<P>
When one lives without God and then one dies, one is judged by
God and the sentence is death.  Thus, the unbeliever has to die
twice- so Qoheleth says it would be better not to be born at all
than to die twice.    If one were to recognize the brevity of
life by ma   king ones presence felof the party house, then one
might decide that eternity is quite longer than time on earth
and make the decision to live for God instead of for fun.
<P>
<B> </B>
<P>
<B>5 It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man
to hear the song of fools. </B>
<P>
<B>6 For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter
of the fool: this also is vanity. </B>
<P>
<B>7 Surely extortion maketh the wise man foolish; and a bribe
destroyeth the understanding. </B>
<P>
How empty is even the joy of the godless!  Even their laughter
is an empty mockery of true joy.
<P>
<B>8 Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof;
and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit.
</B>
<P>
<B>9 Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry; for anger resteth
in the bosom of fools. </B>
<P>
Or, do not let anger get the upper hand in your life; do not be
ruled by circumstances- rather, rule them.
<P>
<B>10 Say not thou, What is the cause that the former days were
better than these? for thou dost not inquire wisely concerning
this. </B>
<P>
&quot;The good old days&quot; were good for us only because, as
children (which we remember as these good old days) cost our parents
a great deal.  Likewise, our children have life easy, as they
do not have to work or worry about bills or security.  Thus, days
of ease always cost someone something, just as God's grace is
free to us but it is not cheap for God.
<P>
<B>11 Wisdom is as good as an inheritance; yea, more excellent
is it for them that see the sun. </B>
<P>
<B>12 For wisdom is a defence, even as money is a defence; but
the excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom preserveth the life
of him that hath it. </B>
<P>
<B>13 Consider the work of God: for who can make that straight,
which he hath made crooked? </B>
<P>
<B>14 In the day of prosperity be joyful, and in the day of adversity
consider; yea, God hath made the one side by side with the other,
to the end that man should not find out anything that shall be after him.</B>
<P>
<B>Life is a gift of God- and for that reason it is lived well
and wisely only when God is depended on (and not money) and wisdom
is real only when it has its basis in God.</B>
<P>
<B>15 All this have I seen in my days of vanity: there is a righteous
man that perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a wicked
man that prolongeth his life in his evil-doing. </B>
<P>
<B>16 Be not righteous overmuch; neither make thyself overwise:
why shouldest thou destroy thyself? </B>
<P>
<B>17 Be not overmuch wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest
thou die before thy time? </B>
<P>
<B>18 It is good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also
from that withdraw not thy hand: for he that feareth God shall
come forth from them all. </B>
<P>
Live life in moderation.
<P>
<B>19 Wisdom is a strength to the wise man more than ten rulers
that are in a city. </B>
<P>
<B>20 Surely there is not a righteous man upon earth, that doeth
good, and sinneth not. </B>
<P>
<B>21 Also take not heed unto all words that are spoken, lest
thou hear thy servant curse thee; </B>
<P>
<B>22 for oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself
likewise hast cursed others. </B>
<P>
Verse 21 in particular is important, for it reminds us that we
ought not take seriously everything we hear.  People say unkind
things in the heat of the moment and they don't often mean what
they say.  Yet if we live always worrying about what people say
about us we will drive ourselves mad.
<P>
<B>23 All this have I proved in wisdom: I said, I will be wise;
but it was far from me. </B>
<P>
<B>24 That which is, is far off and exceeding deep; who can find
it out? </B>
<P>
<B>25 I turned about, and my heart was set to know and to search
out, and to seek wisdom and the reason of things, and to know
that wickedness is folly, and that foolishness is madness. </B>
<P>
<B>26 And I find more bitter than death the woman whose heart
is snares and nets, and whose hands are bands: whoso pleaseth
God sh   all escape from her; by her. </B>
<P>
<B>27 Behold, this have I found, saith the Preacher, laying one
thing to another, to find out the account; </B>
<P>
<B>28 which my soul still seeketh, but I have not found: one man
among a thousand have I found; but a woman among all those have
I not found. </B>
<P>
<B>29 Behold, this only have I found: that God made man upright;
but they have sought out many inventions. </B>
<P>
Here we have another summary concerning the emptiness of life
without God.  Sans God there is no wisdom, no love, no joy, no
companionship, in short, nothing of value.  The composer of this
symphony is once more letting us here the underlying theme.  
Only those totally deaf to the music of life can miss it.
<P>
<B>Chapter 8</B>
<P>
<B>1 Who is as the wise man? and who knoweth the interpretation
of a thing? A man's wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the hardness
of his face is changed. </B>
<P>
<B>2 I counsel thee, Keep the king's command, and that in regard
of the oath of God. </B>
<P>
<B>3 Be not hasty to go out of his presence; persist not in an
evil thing: for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him. </B>
<P>
<B>4 For the king's word hath power; and who may say unto him,
What doest thou? </B>
<P>
<B>5 Whoso keepeth the commandment shall know no evil thing; and
a wise man's heart discerneth time and judgment: </B>
<P>
<B>6 for to every purpose there is a time and judgment; because
the misery of man is great upon him: </B>
<P>
<B>7 for he knoweth not that which shall be; for who can tell
him how it shall be? </B>
<P>
The wise man is the one who knows how to conduct himself in the
presence of authority.  And the greatest authority is God.  Thus,
the wise person takes into account in every decision he or she
makes the will of God.  It is God who knows the outcome of history-
so one can either conform to that history and live wisely or rebel
against that history and live badly.
<P>
<B>8 There is no man that hath power over the spirit to retain
the spirit; neither hath he power over the day of    death; and
there is nall wickedness deliver him that is given to it. </B>
<P>
<B>9 All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work
that is done under the sun: there is a time wherein one man hath
power over another to his hurt. </B>
<P>
<B>10 So I saw the wicked buried, and they came to the grave;
and they that had done right went away from the holy place, and
were forgotten in the city: this also is vanity. </B>
<P>
Furthermore, hypocrisy in religion is another hallmark of folly.
 They hypocrite goes to worship but is not thereby altered.  He
makes an appearance but his life is the same after his 'worship'
experience as it was before- thus proving his foolishness.
<P>
<B>11 Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily,
therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to
do evil. </B>
<P>
<B>12 Though a sinner do evil a hundred times, and prolong his
days, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear
God, that fear before him: </B>
<P>
<B>r </B>Here is another hint that the wise man lives for God
while the fool who relies on his own reason ends up badly.  As
the following verse notes;
<P>
<B>13 but it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall
he prolong his days, which are as a shadow; because he feareth
not before God. </B>
<P>
<B>14 There is a vanity which is done upon the earth, that there
are righteous men unto whom it happeneth according to the work
of the wicked; again, there are wicked men to whom it happeneth
according to the work of the righteous: I said that this also
is vanity. </B>
<P>
<B>15 Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing
under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be joyful: for
that shall abide with him in his labor all the days of his life
which God hath given him under the sun. </B>
<P>
The hint returns, for life finds its joy only in the days it has
been given by God; or, to say it another way, joy comes only to
those who live under God.
<P>
   ain
<P>
<B>16 Whensdom, and to see the business that is done upon the
earth (for also there is that neither day nor night seeth sleep
with his eyes), </B>
<P>
<B>17 then I beheld all the work of God, that man cannot find
out the work that is done under the sun: because however much
a man labor to seek it out, yet he shall not find it; yea moreover,
though a wise man think to know it, yet shall he not be able to
find it. </B>
<P>
Reason, Qoheleth says, cannot really discover the causes or effects
of those issues of life that really matter.  Such things are in
the hand of God alone.  But when one is also in the hand of God
(along with the answers to life's questions) then one is, so to
speak, in the same location as the answers to the questions he
or she is seeking.
<P>
<B>Chapter 9</B>
<P>
<B>1 For all this I laid to my heart, even to explore all this:
that the righteous, and the wise, and their works, are in the
hand of God; whether it be love or hatred, man knoweth it not;
all is before them. </B>
<P>
<B>2 All things come alike to all: there is one event to the righteous
and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean and to the unclean;
to him that sacrificeth and to him that sacrificeth not; as is
the good, so is the sinner; and he that sweareth, as he that feareth
an oath. </B>
<P>
<B>3 This is an evil in all that is done under the sun, that there
is one event unto all: yea also, the heart of the sons of men
is full of evil, and madness is in their heart while they live,
and after that they go to the dead. </B>
<P>
<B>4 For to him that is joined with all the living there is hope;
for a living dog is better than a dead lion. </B>
<P>
<B>5 For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know
not anything, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory
of them is forgotten. </B>
<P>
<B>6 As well their love, as their hatred and their envy, is perished
long ago; neither have they any more a portion for ever in anything
that is done under the sun. </B>
<P>
<B>7 Go thy way, eat thy bread with    joy, and drink thy wi hath
already accepted thy works. </B>
<P>
<B>8 Let thy garments be always white; and let not thy head lack
oil. </B>
<P>
<B>9 Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days
of thy life of vanity, which he hath given thee under the sun,
all thy days of vanity: for that is thy portion in life, and in
thy labor wherein thou laborest under the sun. </B>
<P>
<B>10 Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might;
for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in
Sheol, whither thou goest. </B>
<P>
To life!  This is what Qoheleth says here.  It is simple, direct,
and to the point.  Live as best you can, in the presence of God
for you will one day die.  If you sacrifice, you will still die;
and if you do not sacrifice you will likewise die.  Death, the
great equalizer, will come to every person no matter how they
have lived their lives.  So what takes place after death is what
distinguishes one person from another.  And what takes place is
judgment.  And judgment is conducted on the basis of whether or
not one loved God in life- so live, for God, lest, at the end
of life you are forced to look back at the path you took and realize
that it was all simply a waste.
<P>
<B>11 I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not
to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread
to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favor
to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all. </B>
<P>
Indeed, for under the sun, or on earth, life is hard and incomprehensible.
 Reason can attempt to discover the reasons for the seeming unfairness
of life but it is incapable of doing so and limited in its power.
<P>
<B>12 For man also knoweth not his time: as the fishes that are
taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the
snare, even so are the sons of men snared in an evil time, when
it falleth suddenly upon them. </B>
<P>
<B>13 I have also seen wisdom under the sun on this w   ise, and
it seemed grea little city, and few men within it; and there came
a great king against it, and besieged it, and built great bulwarks
against it. </B>
<P>
<B>15 Now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his
wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same poor
man. </B>
<P>
<B>16 Then said I, Wisdom is better than strength: nevertheless
the poor man's wisdom is despised, and his words are not heard.
</B>
<P>
<B>17 The words of the wise heard in quiet are better than the
cry of him that ruleth among fools. </B>
<P>
<B>18 Wisdom is better than weapons of war; but one sinner destroyeth
much good. </B>
<P>
Wisdom does have a purpose, for it does allow one to benefit others.
 This is exactly what those who do not love God will not do- that
is, be of benefit to others.  Godless people are by definition
selfish people.  So called philanthropists who donate time and
money are in reality simply doing so to boost their own egos and
sense of importance.  It is only the one who loves God who can
truly act in a selfless manner.
<P>
 
<P>
<B>Chapter 10</B>
<P>
<B>1 Dead flies cause the oil of the perfumer to send forth an
evil odor; so doth a little folly outweigh wisdom and honor. </B>
<P>
<B>2 A wise man's heart is at his right hand; but a fool's heart
at his left. </B>
<P>
<B>3 Yea also, when the fool walketh by the way, his understanding
faileth him, and he saith to every one that he is a fool. </B>
<P>
This is a rather humorous segment!  Flies, perfume, foolishness-
all these things are related in that flies in perfume and fools
in society are both destructive.  Like a fly in the perfume, so
is the fool in the house!  The fly makes the perfume useless and
the fool makes the house silly (until, of course, they are removed
and then all is useful once again).
<P>
<B>4 If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not
thy place; for gentleness allayeth great offences. </B>
<P>
Don't respond in haste to words of hostility by a superior; he
   or she will be soothedan in your face type response.
<P>
<B>5 There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, as it were
an error which proceedeth from the ruler: </B>
<P>
<B>6 folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in a low
place. </B>
<P>
<B>7 I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking like
servants upon the earth. </B>
<P>
In the ancient near east it was rather a comedy of errors to see
people &quot;out of place&quot; socially.  The injunction here
is to maintain your social stature.  If wise, act wisely at all
times.
<P>
<B>8 He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh
through a wall, a serpent shall bite him. </B>
<P>
<B>9 Whoso heweth out stones shall be hurt therewith; and he that
cleaveth wood is endangered thereby. </B>
<P>
<B>10 If the iron be blunt, and one do not whet the edge, then
must he put to more strength: but wisdom is profitable to direct.
</B>
<P>
<B>11 If the serpent bite before it is charmed, then is there
no advantage in the charmer. r 12 The words of a wise man's mouth
are gracious; but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself.
</B>
<P>
<B>13 The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness;
and the end of his talk is mischievous madness. </B>
<P>
<B>14 A fool also multiplieth words: yet man knoweth not what
shall be; and that which shall be after him, who can tell him?
</B>
<P>
<B>15 The labor of fools wearieth every one of them; for he knoweth
not how to go to the city. </B>
<P>
Or, be sharp and on your game at all times.  There is nothing
more irritating than going to a wise man expecting help and receiving
only useless advice.  The New Testament says essentially the same
thing when it urges us to &quot;be instant in season and out&quot;
or be always ready to give an answer when asked a question.  This
means that the wise must always be students and must always be
learners.
<P>
<B>16 Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a child, and thy princes
eat in the morning! </B>
<P>
<B>17 Happy art thou, O land, when    thy king is the son ofn
due season, for strength, and not for drunkenness! </B>
<P>
Childish rulers, then as now, were a curse and not a blessing.
 Not knowing how to act, they lead the whole country astray.
<P>
<B>18 By slothfulness the roof sinketh in; and through idleness
of the hands the house leaketh. </B>
<P>
The slothfulness of the fool is a well known topic in the book
of Proverbs.
<P>
<B>19 A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh glad the life;
and money answereth all things. </B>
<P>
<B>20 Revile not the king, no, not in thy thought; and revile
not the rich in thy bedchamber: for a bird of the heavens shall
carry the voice, and that which hath wings shall tell the matter.
</B>
<P>
Be wary of sharing your thoughts with people, and be sure not
to say anything about another person, for they shall surely hear
of it.  The wise person is, above all, a person capable of controlling
their lips.
<P>
<B>Chapter 11</B>
<P>
<B>1 Cast thy bread upon the waters; for thou shalt find it after
many days. </B>
<P>
<B>2 Give a portion to seven, yea, even unto eight; for thou knowest
not what evil shall be upon the earth. </B>
<P>
<B>3 If the clouds be full of rain, they empty themselves upon
the earth; and if a tree fall toward the south, or toward the
north, in the place where the tree falleth, there shall it be.
</B>
<P>
<B>4 He that observeth the wind shall not sow; and he that regardeth
the clouds shall not reap. </B>
<P>
<B>5 As thou knowest not what is the way of the wind, nor how
the bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child; even
so thou knowest not the work of God who doeth all. </B>
<P>
<B>6 In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold
not thy hand; for thou knowest not which shall prosper, whether
this or that, or whether they both shall be alike good. </B>
<P>
<B>7 Truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for
the eyes to behold the sun. </B>
<P>
<B>8 Yea, if a man live many years, let him rejoice in them all;
but let him remember the days of darkness, for they shall be many. All that cometh is vanity.
</B>
<P>
<B>9 Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth, and let thy heart cheer
thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thy heart,
and in the sight of thine eyes; but know thou, that for all these
things God will bring thee into judgment. </B>
<P>
<B>10 Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart, and put away evil
from thy flesh; for youth and the dawn of life are vanity. </B>
<P>
This brief chapter is anti-climactic to the one that follows;
but it nicely sets the stage for the final movement (to retain
our musical metaphor).  Remember God; think about God; serve God.
 Start when you are young or you may never start at all.  This
is, by the way, the truth of the present as well as the past.
 There are countless young people who wander from the Church during
their teenage years because they have not become personally convinced
of the importance of faith.  Their parents are, in some respects,
most unhelpful in the matter; for they often find something to
do other than worship God on Sunday.  As a result the children
grow up thinking that God is somewhat important, but not as important
as going to the lake or going shopping or going to a football
game.
<P>
<B>Chapter 12</B>
<P>
<B>1 Remember also thy Creator in the days of thy youth, before
the evil days come, and the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say,
I have no pleasure in them; </B>
<P>
<B>2 before the sun, and the light, and the moon, and the stars,
are darkened, and the clouds return after the rain; </B>
<P>
<B>3 in the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and
the strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders cease because
they are few, and those that look out of the windows shall be
darkened, </B>
<P>
<B>4 and the doors shall be shut in the street; when the sound
of the grinding is low, and one shall rise up at the voice of
a bird, and all the daughters of music shall be brought low; </B>
<P>
<B>5 yea, they shall be afraid of that which is high, and terrors
shall be in the way; and the almond-tree shall blossom and the grasshopper shall be a burden,
and desire shall fail; because man goeth to his everlasting home,
and the mourners go about the streets: </B>
<P>
<B>6 before the silver cord is loosed, or the golden bowl is broken,
or the pitcher is broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken
at the cistern, </B>
<P>
<B>7 and the dust returneth to the earth as it was, and the spirit
returneth unto God who gave it. </B>
<P>
The preceding chapter continues and enlarges its discussion here.
 Remember God, or turn to God when you have the strength to serve
Him, and do not wait until you are so old that you cannot serve
Him for lack of vigor.  
<P>
<B>8 Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher; all is vanity. </B>
<P>
For the final time Qoheleth plays the chorus.  For the last time
he reminds his readers what life is like for those who forget
God.  Those who in their youth have no time for God will soon
be in the grave without God.  Those in middle age who follow folly
rather than wisdom will soon enough find that folly kills and
their folly is made the worse because they mistakenly believe
themselves wise and their reason as king.  And those in old age
who see that life is short now, if they turn to God, see that
they have no stamina with which to serve Him.  How sad, indeed,
that life is often wasted in such ways.
<P>
<B>9 And further, because the Preacher was wise, he still taught
the people knowledge; yea, he pondered, and sought out, and set
in order many proverbs. </B>
<P>
<B>10 The Preacher sought to find out acceptable words, and that
which was written uprightly, even words of truth. </B>
<P>
<B>11 The words of the wise are as goads; and as nails well fastened
are the words of the masters of assemblies, which are given from
one shepherd. </B>
<P>
<B>12 And furthermore, my son, be admonished: of making many books
there is no end; and much study is a weariness of the flesh. </B>
<P>
<B>13 This is the end of the matter; all hath been heard: fear
God, and keep his commandments; for this is the whole duty of man.
<P>
14 For God will bring
every work into judgment, with every hidden thing, whether it
be good, or whether it be evil. </B>
<P>
<I>Summa Summarum</I>- Revere God!  When one reveres God life is well
worth the living; but when God is forgotten life is simply vain,
empty, futile, and meaningless.
