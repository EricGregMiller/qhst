<B>The Book of 1-2 Samuel</B> 
<P>
<B>I. Title</B> 
<P>
The title, Samuel, is the same in both the Hebrew original and
in the Greek translation. It was derived from the principle character
in the early part of the book, the last judge, Samuel. Calling
the book Samuel, however, is something of a misnomer, it would
seem, because David will play a much more prominent role through
the majority of the story.
<P>
Though separated into two books in our translations, they were
originally one book and will be treated as such for the purpose
of the outline and this introduction.
<P>
<B>II. Author</B> 
<P>
The author of the books is unknown, though obviously it cannot
be Samuel since he is said to have died by 1 Samuel 28:3.
