1. The purpose of this course is to introduce the student to the text, message, and theology of 3 John.
<P>
2. The basic text for this course will be the Latin Vulgate.  The Vulgate, of all the versions of the text, has the honor of being the most ancient, and the most faithful to the Greek text.  The Greek text will also be provided (in an appendix), and the student is required to read the English text in his or her Bible; but the text which will be commented on is the Latin text, included in the body of the course.
<P>
3. Third John is an extremely important book for modern Christianity.  For that reason it deserves our attention.  In order to gain the most from the text, the student is required to read the english text, the Latin text, and the Greek text of this letter.  he or she is also required to read the following commentary on the book:  "3 John" in <i>The New Interpreter's Bible</i>, Vol 12 (Abingdon: 1998).    Books may be purchased through <a href="/amazon.htm"> The Campus Bookstore</a>.
