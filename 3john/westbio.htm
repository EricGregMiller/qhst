&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have enjoyed two decades of study and teaching related to the Bible, its history and its composition and contents. Besides being immersed in the Gospel texts, I have investigated the history of early Christianity, its roots in Judaism and the various influences in the ancient world that shaped it. Over the course of my studies, I have acquired the Biblical languages of Hebrew, Greek and Aramaic as well as modern languages, French and German, necessary to study the scholarly literature in the field.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In addition to my responsibilities as pastor of the First Baptist Church of Petros, in Tennessee, I am the Adjunct Professor of Biblical Studies at the Quartz Hill School of Theology. I have penned abstracts, book reviews, articles and dictionary entries on a wide range of Biblical studies, participate actively in the Society of Biblical Literature and the Catholic Biblical Association, and am a member of the famed -- or infamous, depending on one’s perspective -- Jesus Seminar.<br>
