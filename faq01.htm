        <P>
        <P>
        <P>
          <B>Old Testament</B>
        <P>
          <B>The following books of the Bible are of unknown authorship:</B>
        <P>
          <blockquote>Genesis
            <P>
            Exodus
            <P>
            Leviticus
            <P>
            Numbers
            <P>
            Deuteronomy</blockquote>
        <P>
        These books are traditionally assumed to have been written by Moses, though his 
        authorship is not claimed internally. Since Deuteronomy records the death of 
        Moses, it seems unlikely that he wrote it; certainly he didn't write the part 
        that describes his death. Though some scholars would claim a composite 
        authorship for these books starting around 950 BC with them reaching their 
        final form during the time of Ezra around 500 BC, I would take a more 
        conservative position and argue for a unitary authorship within fifty years of 
        the Exodus (which would date from either around 1290 BC or 1440 BC; that is 
        another whole area of controversy), with much of the material coming from Moses 
        himself (not excluding some obvious editorial activity over the years; notice, 
        for example, Deuternomy 2:10-12).
        <P>
          <blockquote>Joshua</blockquote>
        <P>
        Traditionally, many have claimed Joshua as the author of the book. But 
        considering that the book describes Joshua's death at the end, and includes in 
        the middle (specifically Joshua 15:13-19; cf. Judges 1:1, 9-15) an incident the 
        occured after Joshua's death, it seems impossible that Joshua is the author. On 
        the other hand, the reference to &quot;we&quot; and &quot;us&quot; in Joshua 
        5:1 and 5:6 perhaps suggests an eyewitness to the events was the author of the 
        book. The book would thus date to either the 15th or 13th century BC, 
        depending, again, upon exactly when the Exodus from Egypt occured.
        <P>
        Judges (c. 10th century BC)
        <P>
        Ruth (c. 10th century BC)
        <P>
        1-2 Samuel (8th-6th century BC)
        <P>
        1-2 Kings (6th-5th century BC)
        <P>
        1-2 Chronicles (400 BC would be the earliest possible date for composition)
        <P>
        Esther (5th century BC)
        <P>
        Job (c. 10th century BC at the earliest)
        <P>
        Lamentations
        <P>
        Traditionally the book has been ascribed to Jeremiah the prophet. There is, 
        however, no statement in the book itself suggesting who the author might be, 
        other than that he (or she) is obviously an eyewitness to the destruction of 
        Jerusalem by the Babylonians (c. 586 BC).
        <P>
          <B>Books with known authorship (either in part or in whole)</B>
        <P>
        Psalms
        <P>
        A conglomerate written by many people. The authorship of individual psalms, as 
        attributed by their titles, breaks down as follows (of the 150 psalms, 116 are 
        provided with a title):
        <P>
        Moses - Psalm 90
        <P>
        Heman the Ezrahite - Psalm 88
        <P>
        Ethan the Ezrahite - Psalm 89
        <P>
        Solomon - Psalm 72, 127
        <P>
        David (73 times) - Psalms 3-9, 11-32, 34-41, 51-65, 68-70, 86, 103, 108-110, 
        122, 124, 131, 133, 138-145
        <P>
        Asaph (12 times) - Psalms 50, 73-83
        <P>
        Sons of Korah (9 times) Psalm 42, 44-45, 47-49, 84-85, 87
        <P>
        Author unknown - (49 times) the remainder
        <P>
        The Septuagint (an early Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible from around 200 
        BC) gives some additional authorship identification, as follows:
        <P>
        Jeremiah - Psalm 137
        <P>
        Haggai and Zechariah - Psalms 146-147
        <P>
        Ezra - Psalm 119
        <P>
        Hezekiah (15 times) Psalms 120-134
        <P>
        Though the titles prefaced to the Psalms clearly date back before 200 BC (since 
        they appear in the Septuagint, along with the extras that translation gives), 
        how authoratative they are is subject to much debate.
        <P>
        The psalms, based on the authorship attributions, would then date between the 
        15th century (or 13th, depending on the time of the Exodus) and the 5th 
        century, by which time the book probably took the form it currently has.
        <P>
        Proverbs
        <P>
        Again, the book is a composite, so far as authorship is concerned.
        <P>
        1:1-24:22 is attributed to Solomon (thus dating to the 900's BC)
        <P>
        24:23-34 are attributed to &quot;the wise&quot;
        <P>
        25:1-29:27 are attributed to Solomon, but were collected and recorded by 
        &quot;Hezekiah's men&quot;.
        <P>
        30:1-33 is attributed to Agur
        <P>
        31:1-31 is attributed to Lemuel
        <P>
        Ecclesiastes
        <P>
        The book is attributed to Solomon by some. If that is the case, the book dates 
        to the 900's BC. Others would argue for an unknown author, and put the date of 
        composition around 390 BC.
        <P>
        Ezra-Nehemiah
        <P>
        They are treated as a single book in the Talmud, Josephus, and the Canon of 
        Melito (AD 171). They are also treated as a single book in the Masoretic Text 
        (traditional Hebrew Bible).
        <P>
        The author of the book of Ezra-Nehemiah is unknown, though Ezra 7-9 apparently 
        were written by Ezra, since they are in the first person. The account in 
        chapters 1-6 is compiled from records, including decrees (1:2-4; 6:3-12), 
        genealogies and name lists (2), and letters (4:7-22; 5:6-17). There are two 
        sections that have been preserve in Aramaic (4:8-6:18 and 7:12-26). Aramaic was 
        the diplomatic language during this period. Sources for the section labled 
        &quot;Nehemiah&quot; in our text include what appear to be memoirs of Nehemiah, 
        written in the first person: Nehemiah 1:1-7:73a; 11:1-2; 12:31-43: 13:4-31.
        <P>
        The date of the final composition of the book is generally accepted as being 
        sometime during the 4th century BC.
        <P>
        Song of Songs
        <P>
        The book is attributed to Solomon, which would place its date of composition in 
        the 900's BC.
        <P>
        Isaiah
        <P>
        It is attributed to Isaiah; it consists several oracles given by him over 
        several years (740-690 BC). Its final form as we have it (assuming a single, 
        unitary authorship to the book) would thus be sometime during the 7th century 
        BC.
        <P>
        Jeremiah
        <P>
        It is attributed to Jeremiah, who lived from about 627 to 580 BC.
        <P>
        Ezekiel
        <P>
        It is attributed to Ezekiel, who was born around 622 BC. Based on internal 
        dating, the book covers the time from about 593 through about 570 BC.
        <P>
        Daniel
        <P>
        It is attributed to Daniel, and thus would have been written sometime between 
        605 BC and about 530 BC.
        <P>
        Hosea
        <P>
        Attributed to Hosea. His prophesies cover the period from 753-715 BC.
        <P>
        Joel
        <P>
        Attributed to Joel. The date of the book is uncertain, with dates ranging from 
        the early pre-exilic (800's BC) to late post-exilic period (500-400 BC).
        <P>
        Amos
        <P>
        Attributed to Amos. Dates between 767 and 753 BC.
        <P>
        Obadiah
        <P>
        Attributed to Obadiah. Dates between 847 and 841 BC.
        <P>
        Jonah
        <P>
        Attributed to Jonah. Dates to the 700's BC.
        <P>
        Micah
        <P>
        Attributed to Micah. Dates between 740 and 695 BC.
        <P>
        Nahum
        <P>
        Attributed to Nahum. Two different dates are generally accepted as 
        possibilities for Nahum's ministry: 661-612 BC or 722-701 BC.
        <P>
        Habakkuk
        <P>
        Attributed to Habakkuk. Dates to sometime between 612 and 587 BC.
        <P>
        Zephaniah
        <P>
        Attributed to Zephaniah. Dates sometime during the reign of Josiah (640-609 BC)
        <P>
        Haggai
        <P>
        Attributed to Haggai. It is possible to date his prophesies very exactly (since 
        he gave us the precise day he uttered his prophesies):
        <P>
        1:1 August 29, 520 BC
        <P>
        1:15 September 21, 520 BC
        <P>
        2:19-20 December 18, 520 BC
        <P>
        Zechariah
        <P>
        Chapters 1-8 are attributed to Zechariah and can be dated precisely.
        <P>
        1:1 October, 520 BC
        <P>
        1:7 February 15, 519 BC
        <P>
        7:1 December 7, 518 BC
        <P>
        Chapters 9-14 were not written by Zechariah and cannot be easily dated. That 
        they were not written by Zechariah is clear from both internal and external 
        evidence.
        <P>
        9-11 were written by Jeremiah, according to Matthew 27:9-10, which quotes 
        Zecharaiah 11:12-13 and attributes it to Jeremiah. The date would then be 
        sometime between 627 and 580 BC
        <P>
        Chapters 12-14 are titled &quot;an oracle&quot; and are attributed to no one.
        <P>
        Malachi
        <P>
        Based on Mark 1:2-3, the book called &quot;Malachi&quot; was apparently 
        actually written by Isaiah, since there the author of Mark quotes from 
        &quot;Malachi&quot; but attributes it to Isaiah. The title &quot;Malachi&quot;, 
        taken from 1:1 is simply the Hebrew phrase &quot;my messenger&quot;, and the 
        word is so translated in 3:1.
        <P>
        The date of the book would then be sometime between 740 and 690 BC.
        <P>
          <B>New Testament</B>
        <P>
        Matthew
        <P>
        Attributed to Matthew. Probably written sometime between AD 55 and 75.
        <P>
        Mark
        <P>
        Attributed to John Mark. Probably written before AD 70, and before the books of 
        Matthew or Luke were composed.
        <P>
        Luke
        <P>
        Attributed to Luke. Since the book of Acts (also attributed to Luke) was 
        written afterward, and since Acts was apparently written before Paul's 
        execution during the reign of Nero, the book of Luke is apparently relatively 
        early, perhaps before AD 60.
        <P>
        John
        <P>
        Attributed to John. Probably composed between AD 85 and 90, though some 
        scholars have suggested dates as early as AD 45 and as late as AD 110.
        <P>
        Acts
        <P>
        Attributed to Luke. Probably composed around AD 64 (Paul's imprisonment in Rome 
        was from AD 61-63).
        <P>
        Romans
        <P>
        Attributed to Paul. Written AD 56 or 57.
        <P>
        1 Corinthians
        <P>
        Attributed to Paul. Written AD 55.
        <P>
        2 Corinthians
        <P>
        Attributed to Paul. Written AD 56.
        <P>
        Galatians
        <P>
        Attributed to Paul. Written AD 52
        <P>
        Ephesians
        <P>
        Attributed to Paul. Written AD 63.
        <P>
        Philippians
        <P>
        Attributed to Paul. Written between AD 59 and AD 61.
        <P>
        Colossians
        <P>
        Attributed to Paul. Written AD 62.
        <P>
        1 Thessalonians
        <P>
        Attributed to Paul. Written AD 50.
        <P>
        2 Thessalonians
        <P>
        Attributed to Paul. Written AD 50.
        <P>
        1 Timothy
        <P>
        Attributed to Paul. Written between AD 62 and AD 67.
        <P>
        2 Timothy
        <P>
        Attributed to Paul. Written between AD 62 and AD 67.
        <P>
        Titus
        <P>
        Attributed to Paul. Written AD 63.
        <P>
        Philemon
        <P>
        Attributed to Paul. Written between AD 56 and AD 62.
        <P>
        Hebrews
        <P>
        Traditionally Paul has been given credit for the book, though there is nothing 
        in the book to suggest that he is the author; and from the standpoint of the 
        style and structure of the book Pauline authorship is so unlikely as to be 
        excluded as even reasonably possible. Written between AD 66 and AD 70 
        (certainly written before the destruction of Jerusalem AD 70).
        <P>
        James
        <P>
        Attributed to James. Written between AD 45 and AD 50.
        <P>

        <P>
        Attributed to Peter. Written between AD 62 and AD 64.
        <P>
        2 Peter
        <P>
        Attributed to Peter. Written between AD 64 and AD 68.
        <P>
        1 John
        <P>
        Attributed to John. Written between AD 85 and AD 90.
        <P>
        2 John
        <P>
        Attributed to John. Written AD 90.
        <P>

        <P>
        Attributed to John. Written AD 90.
        <P>
        Jude
        <P>
        Attributed to Jude. Written between AD 60 and AD 65.
        <P>
