Hello,<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I located your site through a friend of mine with whom I discuss ancient
history of the Middle East.
His wife saw the discussion regarding the archaeological excavations of
Ugarit and he passed it along to me.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I must say that I am surprised and impressed by the display of
intelligent and loving hearts and minds I have seen on your website.
When I saw that Quartz Hill Community Church is a member of the Southern
Baptist Convention, I must say that I was amazed.   I'm afraid I have
let bigotry creep into my own heart, as I allowed the negativity
preached by a few members of this organization color my view of the
entire Convention.  I thought that the SBC was a group of hate mongers,
and I was terribly wrong.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; After visiting such hateful websites as www.godhatesfags.com, reading
your Current Diatribe was a refreshing difference.  It was refreshing
because it was a message rooted in love instead of hate and fear.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Your thoughts, your research and your views have touched me in a very
positive way, and for that I am extremely thankful.  With love in your
heart, there is nothing that you cannot overcome, and your organization
is a living testament to that.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am not a Christian, but I am compelled to say:<br>
<blockquote>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; May the peace of God, which passes all understanding, keep your hearts
and minds in the knowledge of Jesus Christ, the Lord.</blockquote><br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bright Blessings to you and yours,<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ken

Hi,<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Just found your website and read the diatribe on gays.  I especially liked 
the line, "Since when has the church become an exclusive club?"
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From what I've seen on your website, it looks good.  I may be back!
<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I liked it because it put me face to face with the personal moral problem involved in despising a gay person.<br>
