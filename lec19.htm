<h1><b>Assyria</b></h1>
<P>
 Meanwhile, three hundred miles north of Babylon, another civilization
grew strong.  The new state grew around four cities fed by the
waters or tributaries of the Tigris: Ashur, Arbela, Nimrud (or
Calah/Kalakh) and Nineveh.
<P>
 The god Ashur gave his name to the city Ashur, and then to the
whole of Assyria.  There, the earliest of the nation's kings had
their residence, until its exposure to the heat of the desert
and the attack of the neighboring Babylonians led Ashur's rulers
to build a secondary capital in cooler Nineveh, named after Nina,
the Ishtar of Assyria.
<P>
 Here, in the heyday of Ashurbanipal, 300,000 peope lived. The
population was a mixture of Semites from the south and non-Semitic
tribes from the west (Hittites).  They took their common language
and their arts from Sumeria, but modified them later into an almost
undistinguishable similarity to the language and arts of Babylonia.
<P>
 However, unlike Babylon, from beginning to end they were a race
of warriors, almost like the Klingons in their devotion to it,
though crueler and more brutal to the point of sadism.  Their
history is one of kings and slaves, wars and conquests, bloody
victories and sudden defeat.
<P>
 The early kings took advantage of the Kassite domination of Babylon
to establish their independence.  Soon enough, one of them decked
himself with the title &quot;king of the universe&quot;.  While
Babylonia was still under in the darkness of Kassite rule, Shalmaneser
I brought the little city states of the north under one rule and
made Kalakh (Nimrud) the capital.
<P>
 The first great name in Assyrian historyis Tiglath-Pileser I
(1276 BC).  Although it is unwise to believe politicians, we must
depend upon his own words, since we have no others.  He said that
he had been a great hunter, having killed one hundred twenty lions
on foot and eight hundred from his chariot.  He was not just a
hunter of animals, though, but also of nations.
<P>
 
<P>
 In my fierce valor I marched against the people of Qummuh, conquered
their cities, carried off their booty, their goods, and their
property without reckoning, and burned their cities with fire
-- destroyed and devastated them... The people of Adansh left
their mountain and embraced my feet.  I imposed tribute on them...
<P>
 In every direction he led his armies, conquering the Hittites,
the Armenians, and forty other nations, capturing at last Babylon
and frightening Egypt into sending him anxious gifts.  He was
particularly molified by the crocodile they had sent him.
<P>
 With the proceeds of his conquests, he then built great temples
to the Assyrian pantheon of gods and godesses.  
<P>
 Then, Babylon revolted, defeated his armies, pillaged his temples,
and carried his gods away to Babylon.  Tiglath-Pileser I died
in shame, but his reign serves as a symbol and summary of all
Assyrian history: death and taxes -- first for Assyria's neighbors,
and then for herself.
<P>
<B>Ashurnasirpal II</B>
<P>
 Ashurnasirpal II conquered a dozen petty states, brought much
booty home from the wars, with his own hands he cut out they eyeballs
of princely captives, and he enoyed his harem.  He passed away
respectably.
<P>
<B>Shalmaneser III</B>
<P>
 Shalmaneser III carried his conquests as far as Damascus (see
the discussion on the Arameans), fought costly battles, killed
16,000 Syrians in one engagement, built temples, levied tribute,
and was finally deposed by his son in a violent revolt.  He is
the Shalmaneser mentioned in 2 Kings 17:3ff.
<P>
<B>Tiglath-Pileser III</B>
<P>
 Tiglath-Pileser III gathered new armies, reconquered Armenia,
overran Syria and Babylonia, made vassle cities of Damascus, Samaria,
and Babylon, extended the rule of Assyria from the Caucasus to
Egypt, tired of war, became an excellent administrator, built
many temples and palaces, held his empire together with an iron
hand, and died peacefully in bed.
<P>
<B>Sargon II</B>
<P>
 Sargon II, an officer in the army, made himself king in a coup
d'etat; he led his troops in person and took in every engagement
in the most dangerous post.
<P>
 He defeated Elam and Egypt, reconquered Babylonia, and received
the homage of the Jews, Philistines, and Cypriot Greeks.
<P>
 He ruled his empire well, encouraged arts and letters, handicrafts
and trade, and died in a victorious battle which preserved Assyria
for invasion by the wild Cimmerian hordes.
<P>
<B>Sennacherib</B>
<P>
 His son Sennacherib put down revolts in the distant provinces
adjoining the Persian Gulf, and attacked Egypt and Jerusalem without
success (cf. 2 Kings 18:17-37).
<P>
 All in all, he was something of an incompetent, in addition to
being a barbarian.
<P>
 Irritated by the Babylonian penchant for freedom, he beseiged
it, took it, and burned it to the ground.  Nearly all the inhabitants,
young and old, male and female, were put to death, so that mountains
of corpses blocked the streets.
<P>
 The temples and palaces were pillaged to the last sheckel, and
the once omnipotent gods of Babylon were hacked to pieces or were
carried off to bondage.
<P>
 Sennacherib's sons finally assassinated him, though, while he
was praying to his gods.
<P>
Essarhaddon
<P>
 Another of Sennacherib's sons, Esarhaddon, took the throne from
his murderous brothers and then invaded Egypt to punish it for
supporting the Syrian revolts.  He turned it into an Assyrian
province.
<P>
 He then delighted the Babylonians by freeing and honoring their
captive gods and by rebuilding the city.  He conciliated Elam
by feeding its famine stricken people in an act of international
beneficence almost without parallel in the ancient world.
<P>
 He died on his way to suppress a revolt in Egypt after giving
his empire what many consider to be the most just and enlightened
rule in its half-barbarous history.
<P>
<B>Ashurbanipal</B>
<P>
 His successor was Ashurbanipal, who reaped the fruits of Esarhaddon's
sowing.
<P>
 During his long reign, Assyria reached the climax of its wealth
and prestige.  After him, Assyria, ruined by forty years of intermittant
war, fell into exaustion and decay and ended its career ten years
after his death.
<P>
 A scribe has preserved for us a yearly record of his reign. 
It is a dull and bloody mess of war after war, seige after seige,
starved cities and flayed captives.  He destroyed Elam.  The severed
head of the Elamite king was brought to Ashurbanipal as he feasted
with his queen in the palace garden.  He had the head raised on
a pole in the midst of his guests, and the royal party continued
uninterrupted.  Later, he had the head stuck over the gate of
Nineveh, where it slowly rotted away.
<P>
 The Elamite general, Dananu, was flayed alive; then he was bled
like a sheep.  His brother had his throat cut, and his body was
divided into pieces, which were then distributed over the country
as souvenirs.
<P>
 It never occured to Ashurbanipal that he or his army were unusually
brutal.  They viewed their behavior as necessary and proper, and
a useful technique too keep rebellions at bay and to establish
discipline among the heterogenous peoples that made up the Assyrian
Empire: Ethiopia, Armenia, Syria, Media, and so on.
<P>
 Still, Ashurbanipal was not all blood and guts.  He sent out
sculptors and architects to design and adorn new temples and palaces
throughout the empire; he comissioned scribes to secure and copy
the classics of Sumerian and Babylonian literature which he then
gathered into his library at Nineveh.  As this library was unearthed
nearly intact, much of what we today know of the ancient literatures
of Babylonia and Sumeria are thanks to him.
<P>
<B>The End of Ashurbanipal and Assyria</B>
<P>
 Ashurbanipal died in 626 BC.  Fourteen years later an army of
Babylonians under the leadership of Nabopollassar united with
an army of Medes lead by Cyaxares and a hoard of Scythians from
the Caucasus and defeated the Assyrian Empire.  Nineveh was laid
waste as ruthlessly and completely as Susa and Babylon had been
by the Assyrians.  Nineveh was put to the torch, the population
was slaughtered, survivors were enslaved, the palace was sacked
and destroyed.  Thus, the Assyrians disappeared from the world
stage.
<P>
 The last tablet, written by Ashurbanipal just before he died
records the following (in typical Near Eastern government style):
<P>
 I did well to god and man, to dead and living.  Why have sickness
and misery befallen me?  I cannot do away with the strife in my
country and the dissensions in my family; disturbing scandles
oppress me always.  Illness of mind and flesh bow me down; with
cries of woe I bring my days to an end.  On the day of the city
god, the day of the festival, I am wretched.  Death is seizing
hold upon me, and wears me down.  With lamentation and mourning
I wail day and night, and groan, &quot;O god!  Grant to one who
is impious that he may see thy light!&quot;
