<P>
<B>The Book of Daniel</B> 
<P>
<B>I. Title</B> 
<P>
The book of Daniel is named after the main protagonist throughout;
unlike his friends, who are remembered by their Babylonian names
rather than their Hebrew names, and unlike Esther, who is likewise
remembered for her Persian (or Aramaic) name, rather than her
Hebrew name, Daniel, although given a Babylonian name, is not
well remembered by it (Belteshazzar).
<P>
<B>II. Author and Setting</B> 
<P>
The author of the book is Daniel, although many modern critics
would try to date the book much later, to the fifth or fourth
century BC; the reason for such a late date though is primarily
a result of the presuppositional determination that predictive
prophesy is not possible; therefore, the &quot;prophesies&quot;
are so accurate in Daniel, not because he was inspired by God,
but because the author (whomever he might be) wrote them after
the events described had happened.
<P>
One wonders, then, why such a book would have ever been accepted
as scripture or as at all authoritative.
<P>
Taking the book at face value, then, Daniel was taken captive
by Nebuchadnezzar in 605 BC, during the first deportation recorded
in 2 Kings 24:8- 17. Daniel continued to minister through the
reign of King Cyrus, under whom the Israelites began to return
to Israel (see Ezra 1:1-4 and 2 Chronicles 36:22-23).

<P>
2. <I>three more kings</I> = Cambyses 529, Smerdis 522, Darius
Hystaspes 521
<P>
<I>a fourth king</I> = Xerxes 486-65
<P>
3. <I>a mighty king</I> = Alexander the Great
<P>
4. <I>four points of compass</I> = ruled by Cassander (Madedon,
Lysimachus [Thrace/Asia Minor); Ptolemy (Egypt); Selecus (Babylon/Syria
-- took Babylonian satrapy in 321, Syria in 301 after battle of
Ipsus [vs. Macedonia], gained Asia Minor, killed at Hellespont)
<P>
5. <I>king of the South</I> = Ptolemy I Soter (b. 367; ruled 304-283)
who married Berenice I
<P>
<I>one of his princes</I> = Seleucus Nicator who fled from Antigonus
in Babylon to serve Ptolemy; regained supremacy after Antigonus
lost at Gaza in 312; he assumed kingship in 304 in north when
Ptolemy did in the south; he gained the ascendancy during the
time of Ptolemy II Philadelphia
<P>
<I>him</I> = Ptolemy II Philadelphus 283-46 who was born in 308
of Ptolemy I Soter and Berenice I; he married his sister Arinoe
II in 276. Administered successfully. Septuagint translated. Meanwhile
Antiochus I Soter (280-62) obtained peace with Macedonia in 279
but gradually lost much of it.
<P>
6. <I>daughter of the king of the south</I> = Berenice II, daughter
of Ptolemy II Philadelphus who in 247 married Antiochus II Theos.
<P>
<I>king of the north</I> = Antiochus II Theos (262-246) who regained
much from Egypt of what her father lost in Asia Minor and Syria.
When Ptolemy II Philadelphus died in 246, Berenice II was divorced
by her husband who married Laodice, a former wife, who poisoned
her new husband Antiochus II, thus removing &quot;his arm&quot;.
After poisoning Berenice II too, Laodice appointed her son, Seleucus
II Callinicus as king.
<P>
7. <I>one of the descendants of her line</I> = Ptolemy III Euergetes
(246-221), brother of Berenice II.
<P>
<I>the king of the north</I> = Seleucus II Callinicus (247-226),
son of Laodice who was defeated in a later invasion of Egypt.
He lost most of Asia Minor along with losing to the military expansion
of Ptolemy III who put his mother Laodice to death. Seleucus II
Callinicus failed to invade Egypt in 240.
<P>
10. <I>his sons</I> = Seleucus III Ceraunus (227-223) and Antiochus
III the Great (223-187). Both built large armies. The oldest was
killed in Asia Minor and Antiochus III the Great pushed down into
Palestine to the fortress Raphia in 219 where he was defeated
in 217 by Ptolemy IV Philopator.
<P>
11. <I>the king of the South</I> = Ptolemy IV Philopator (221-204)
who defeated Antiochus III the Great in a great victory at Raphia
in 217. He did not follow up on his advantage.
<P>
13. <I>the king of the north</I> = Antiochus III the Great campaigned
in the east (212-204) but returned with a much larger force against
Ptolemy IV Philopator, son of Ptolemy III and Berenice II (b.
244) who died in 203.
<P>
14. <I>the king of the South</I> = Ptolemy V Epiphanes (203-181)
who was opposed by the Nubians who controlled Thebes (208-186).
<P>
<I>the many</I> = the Nubians who controlled Thebes (208-186)
and Philip V of Macedonia who joined the Jews who were tired of
Egyptian control of Palestine.
<P>
15. Antiochus III the Great captured the fortified city of Sidon
in 203 and held Palestine by 199 but was driven back by Scopas
of Egypt in 198 who eventually lost at Paneas and Sidon which
assured Antiochus III the Great complete authority over Palestine.
<P>
17. <I>the daughter of women</I> = Cleopatra I, the daughter of
Antiochus III the Great, given in marriage to Ptolemy V Ephiphanes
in hopes of controlling Egypt in 193 (contracted the marriage
in 197 when Ptolemy V Ephiphanes was only 10) so that Antiochus
III the Great could attack Rome; but Cleopatra I sided with her
new husband and Egypt actively allied with Rome against Antiochus
III the Great, Asia Minor, and Greece.
<P>
18. <I>The coastlands</I> = Asia Minor and Greece, against which
Antiochus III the Great moved; he even moved against a part of
Thrace in 196 taking Thermopylae with the help of Hannibal; but
a <I>commander</I> Lucius Cornelus Scipio (Scipio Asiaticus),
brother of Scipio Africanus who earlier defeated Hannibal and
the Carthaginians, defeated Antiochus III the Great and drove
him from Thermopylae in 191 and won a second victory in 190 at
Magnesia in Lydia in Asia Minor, thereby forcing the peace of
Apamea in 188 which gave up all Asia Minor.
<P>
19. Antiochus III the Great returned to his own land and was probably
slain about 187.
<P>
20. <I>one will arise</I> = Seleucus IV Philopator (187-176),
a son of Antiochus III the Great. He didn't last long; probably
he was poisoned by his prime minister, Heliodorus.
<P>
21. <I>a despicable person</I> = Antiochus Epiphanes (175-164),
the &quot;little horn&quot; of chapter 8.
