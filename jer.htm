<B>The Book of Jeremiah</B> 
<P>
<B>I. Title</B> 
<P>
The book is called by the name of its author, in both the Hebrew
original and in English translations.
<P>
<B>II. Author and Setting</B> 
<ADDRESS>
A. Introduction
</ADDRESS>

<P>
Jeremiah's name means &quot;Yahweh establishes&quot;. Jeremiah
was a priest, the son of Hilkiah, and lived in the priestly town
of Anathoth, about three miles north of Jerusalem (1 Chron. 6:60).
There is little disagreement over Jeremiah being the author of
the book that bears his name, though its arrangement is probably
due to Baruch, his amanuensis.
<ADDRESS>
B. Historical Setting
</ADDRESS>

<P>
Jeremiah lived from about 627 to 580 BC, a crucial period in the
history of Judah, the Southern Kingdom. Except for a brief period
of independence under Josiah, Judah existed as a vassal under
Assyria, Egypt and Babylon. He began writing during the thirteenth
year of Josiah's reign (Jer. 1:2, 25:3).
<P>
In the introduction to his commentary on Jeremiah, John Bright
writes:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;Before one can hope to read the words of Israel's prophets
with understanding and appreciation, it is necessary first of
to gain at least a general knowledge of the times in which they
lived and the situation to which they addressed themselves. In
view of what has already been said the reasons for this are obvious.
The very nature of the prophetic office as the prophets themselves
understood it demands of us a concern with history. Had the prophets
been religious teachers, philosophers, or thinkers who propounded
timeless truths concerning God, man, and the proper conduct of
life, it might be possible to abstract their words from history
and appreciate them for their intrinsic worth and their literary
quality without troubling too much about the circumstances that
called them forth. But the prophets, it cannot be said too often,
were nothing of the sort. On the contrary, they saw themselves
as messengers of their God, commissioned to convey to the people
the word that their God had given them. This conviction of theirs,
whatever we may think of it, must be taken with utmost seriousness
if we are to understand them. Because of their function their
word was always a specific word: a specific directive to a specific
people, caught up in the never-to-be- repeated events of a specific
and never-to-be-repeated time in their history. Moreover, it was
essentially a word that interpreted events, the events through
which the people were passing or were about to pass, in light
of the divine demands and promises. And this is why it is only
against the background of their times that the sayings of the
prophets come alive -- indeed, in many instances, make sense at
all.&quot; (John Bright. <I>Jeremiah, the Anchor Bible.</I> New
York: Doubleday, 1965, p. xxvii)

<P>
Jeremiah ministered during the reigns of Josiah, Jehoahaz, Jehoiakim,
Jehoiachin, Zedekiah, and the governorship of Gedaliah. When he
began his ministry, the Northern Kingdom of Israel had already
been in captivity for nearly one hundred years; Josiah was attempting
to extend his influence over the territory formerly controlled
by the north.
<P>
Manasseh's evil reign had ended fifteen years before, perhaps
when Jeremiah was quite young. After Manasseh, Amon's reign, also
evil, lasted barely two years.
<P>
Jeremiah's ministry began during the early reformation by Josiah,
a reformation that was mostly skin deep, affecting few beyond
his immediate circle. It would be five more years before the book
of the law would be found by Hilkiah, as he was cleaning the temple.
<P>
On the world scene, Jeremiah's lifetime was a period of empires
jockeying for world domination. The Assyrian empire began to disintegrate
after the death of Ashurbanipal in 626 BC, with the capital, Nineveh,
falling to Nebuchadnezzar in 612 BC. In 605 BC Nebuchadnezzar
defeated Egypt at Carchemish, thus gaining control of all of western
Asia.
<P>
In 609 BC Josiah was killed in battle at Megiddo, when he foolishly
went out to fight Pharaoh Necho. Judah, at this point, became
a vassal to Egypt.
<P>
In 606 BC, Nebuchadnezzar besieged Jerusalem and took many captives
(Daniel 1:1). In 603 BC, Jehoiakim rebelled against Nebuchadnezzar;
from that time on, Babylon, Moab and Ammon began systematically
dismantling the Jewish state.
<P>
In 597 BC Nebuchadnezzar took Jerusalem, bound Jehoiakim, and
took him to Babylon, along with many of the temple vessels.
<P>
In 588 BC, Nebuchadnezzar besieged Jerusalem until 586 when famine
swept the city; Nebuchadnezzar sacked the city, and burned it
to the ground. The temple was destroyed.
<P>
Jeremiah was not the only prophet at this time: preaching with
him, were Zephaniah, Habakkuk, and Huldah, the prophetess in Judah.
Meanwhile, Daniel and Ezekiel were busy in Babylonian captivity.
<P>
To get a good picture of what is transpiring during Jeremiah's
prophetic ministry, the interested reader should review 2 Kings
21-25 and 2 Chronicles 33-36.
