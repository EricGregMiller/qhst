        <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The <i>Current Diatribe</i> is an editorial of up 
          to a thousand words on some topic of concern to one of the faculty, students, 
          or staff of Quartz Hill School of Theology. Occasionally, we may have guest 
          diatribes. We welcome <A HREF="#comments">comments</A> and will post the more 
          interesting ones as <A HREF="letters.htm"><i>Letters From Readers</i></A>
        . We look forward to your reaction and input. All letters submitted will become 
        the property of Quartz Hill School of Theology. Which letters get posted will 
        be entirely up to us and our decisions are final. Letters may be edited for 
        conciseness and to correct minor errors of spelling or grammar.<P>

        <p>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have yet to hear either a good rational or a good 
          moral argument in all the uproar against cloning in general, and the cloning of 
          human beings in particular. Yet, that has not stopped most religious groups 
          across the spectrum, and most politicians, from lashing out and intoning that 
          the cloning of human beings is evil.<br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Um, could someone show me something biblical that 
          would tell me that cloning is bad? Or give me a rational argument, derived from 
          other moral principals known from the Bible or from reason, that tells me it is 
          an inherently evil act? I'm not interested in appeals to authority or lists of 
          all the decent folks who don't like cloning. Such arguments are specious.<br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I don't mean to be obtuse, but emotional arguments, 
          or statements that simply say something akin to "it's evil; everyone knows 
          that." or "it's just evil. Of course it is." are not going to sway me. They are 
          not reasoned arguments at all; instead, they are statements of preference -- of 
          simple taste, if you will. It's fine if you don't like the taste of liver; 
          that's hardly a moral issue, however.<br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the first place, we've been cloning plants for 
          millennia; any cutting taken from a living plant and propagated so that it 
          grows a new plant is a clone. As far as people are concerned, identical twins 
          and triplets are natural clones, and so unless one feels frightened by twins 
          and triplets (which, actually is the case in some cultures), then why should we 
          be opposed to cloning? I mean, if God does it, then how can it be a bad thing? 
          The arguments against cloning strike me as akin to those raised against invitro 
          fertilization, or surrogate motherhood, or contraception in general. Vague 
          statements of protest that argue we "shouldn't be playing God" are entirely 
          specious it seems to me, given that the Bible indicates that the human race has 
          been made in God's image and we have been given dominion. I would in fact 
          suggest that God's purpose for humanity was for it to play God.<br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Opposition based on the idea that somehow we 
          shouldn't create life, or that we shouldn't interfere in the creation of life, 
          or that, as one person, Israel's Chief Rabbi Israel Meir Lau, stated, "The 
          moment medical science tries to take upon itself duties and areas which are not 
          its responsibility such as shortening life, cloning, or creating life in an 
          unnatural way we must set down borders in order not to harm the basic belief 
          that there is a creator of the universe in whose hands life and death are 
          placed," doesn't make sense to me, either. Taken to a logical extreme, such 
          arguments seem to suggest anything we do to prolong and improve life would be a 
          bad thing, an interference in what is natural, a playing of God. "Don't give 
          him that shot, it might interfere with the natural propagation of that disease. 
          We wouldn't be wanting to play God or maybe interfere with God's will." That's 
          nonsense, obviously, yet that is the logical end of the arguments I'm hearing.<br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I'm sorry, but I just don't get it. It seems to me 
          that opposition to cloning is just one more example in a long list of 
          frightened, ignorant people being afraid of what's new. People have opposed 
          airplanes, space travel, computers, genetic engineering, anesthetics, 
          antibiotics, and the like, using the same sorts of arguments that I'm seeing 
          raised against cloning. I don't like this opposition. I don't understand it. 
          And frankly, it kind of scares me.<br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And don't tell me that we should oppose cloning 
          because of the potential bad things that might come from it. Just oppose those 
          bad things then. After all, a baby might grow up to become a serial killer; 
          does that mean we should be opposed to babies?<br>
