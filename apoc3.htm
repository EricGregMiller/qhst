<b>2.  Old Testament Apocalyptic</b>
<P>
 <blockquote>a. Daniel</blockquote>
<P>
<b>ASSIGNMENT:</b>  Read the Book of Daniel
<P>
 The book of Daniel, in English versions of the Bible is found
among the Prophets.  however, in the Hebrew Bible, Daniel is found
in the third division, the Writings.  This means that the editors
of the Hebrew Bible do not consider Daniel a &quot;Prophet&quot;
but something else.  And they are quite right, because Daniel
is not prophetic literature, it is apocalyptic.r  The first six
chapters of the book demonstrate the wise Daniel as dream interpreter
and faithful servant of God in difficult times.  Chapters 7-12
contain the apocalyptic visions which Daniel sees during those
difficult days.  These &quot;visions&quot; are simply intended
to show that faithful men and women need not fear any oppressive
power.
<P>
 We shall look briefly at Daniel 7 and interpret it according
to its proper genre.
<P>
<blockquote><B>In the first year of King Belshazzar of Babylon, Daniel had
a dream and visions of his head as he lay in bed. Then he wrote
down the dream:  2 I,  Daniel, saw in my vision by night the four
winds of heaven stirring up the great sea, 3 and four great beasts
came up out of the sea, different from one another. 4 The first
was like a lion and had eagles' wings. Then, as I watched, its
wings were plucked off, and it was lifted up from the ground and
made to stand on two feet like a human being; and a human mind
was given to it. 5 Another beast appeared, a second one, that
looked like a bear. It was raised up on one side, had three tusks
in its mouth among its teeth and was told, &quot;Arise, devour
many bodies!&quot; 6 After this, as I watched, another appeared,
like a leopard. The beast had four wings of a bird on its back
and four heads; and dominion was given to it. 7 After this I saw
in the visions by night a fourth beast, terrifying and dreadful
and exceedingly strong. It had great iron teeth and was devouring,
breaking in pieces,    and stamping what was ferent from all the
beasts that preceded it, and it had ten horns. 8 I was considering
the horns, when another horn appeared, a little one coming up
among them; to make room for it, three of the earlier horns were
plucked up by the roots. There were eyes like human eyes in this
horn, and a mouth speaking arrogantly.  9 As I watched, thrones
were set in place, and an Ancient One took his throne, his clothing
was white as snow, and the hair of his head like pure wool; his
throne was fiery flames, and its wheels were burning fire. 10
A stream of fire issued and flowed out from his presence.  A thousand
thousands served him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood
attending him. The court sat in judgment, and the books were opened.
11 I watched then because of the noise of the arrogant words that
the horn was speaking. And as I watched, the beast was put to
death, and its body destroyed and given over to be burned with
fire. 12 As for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken
away, but their lives were prolonged for a season and a time.
13 As I watched in the night visions, I saw one like a human being
coming with the clouds of heaven. And he came to the Ancient One
and was presented before him. 14 To him was given dominion and
glory and kingship, that all peoples, nations, and languages should
serve him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion that shall
not pass away, and his kingship is one that shall never be destroyed.
15 As for me, Danie   l, my spirit was troub of my head terrified
me. 16 I approached one of the attendants to ask him the truth
concerning all this. So he said that he would disclose to me the
interpretation of the matter: 17 &quot;As for these four great
beasts, four kings shall arise out of the earth. 18 But the holy
ones of the Most High shall receive the kingdom and possess the
kingdom forever-forever and ever.&quot; 19 Then I desired to know
the truth concerning the fourth beast, which was different from
all the rest, exceedingly terrifying, with its teeth of iron and
claws of bronze, and which devoured and broke in pieces, and stamped
what was left with its feet; 20 and concerning the ten horns that
were on its head, and concerning the other horn, which came up
and to make room for which three of them fell out-the horn that
had eyes and a mouth that spoke arrogantly, and that seemed greater
than the others. 21 As I looked, this horn made war with the holy
ones and was prevailing over them, 22 until the Ancient One came;
then judgment was given for the holy ones of the Most High, and
the time arrived when the holy ones gained possession of the kingdom.
23 This is what he said: &quot;As for the fourth beast, there
shall be a fourth kingdom on earth that shall be different from
all the other kingdoms; it shall devour the whole earth, and trample
it down, and break it to pieces. 24 As for the ten horns, out
of this kingdom ten kings shall arise, and another shall arise
after them. This one shall be different from the former ones,
and shall put down three kings. 25 He shall speak    words against
the Mosy ones of the Most High, and shall attempt to change the
sacred seasons and the law; and they shall be given into his power
for a time, two times, and half a time. 26 Then the court shall
sit in judgment, and his dominion shall be taken away, to be consumed
and totally destroyed. 27 The kingship and dominion and the greatness
of the kingdoms under the whole heaven shall be given to the people
of the holy ones of the Most High; their kingdom shall be an everlasting
kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey them.&quot; 28
Here the account ends. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts greatly
terrified me, and my face turned pale; but I kept the matter in
my mind.</B></blockquote>
<P>
 Note, first of all, that the visions are based on animal imagery.
 This is a standard motif of apocalyptic literature, as the reader
will know from the book of Revelation.  Animals stand for peoples
or powers in this literature.  Second, the highly graphic imagery
demands a symbolic rather than a literal interpretation.  Third,
the victory of God is assured in spite of the power of His enemies.
 This is the primary truth which apocalyptic attempts to communicate.
<P>
 The imagery utilized in this and the other visions of Daniel
has historical antecedents in the Canaanite myths.  For instance,
if one were to read the Canaanite myth of Baal and El one would
see remarkable parallels to this material in Daniel.  What this
means is that apocalyptic literature draws from the storehouse
of contemporary mythology for its imagery.
<P>
 The book of Daniel was composed during the reign of Antiochus
Epiphanes (see any standard Bible Dictionary).  It was written
in order to assure the people of God that in spite of their present
hardship, all would be well in the end.
