<h1><b>Babylonia</b></h1>
<P>
 Historically and ethically, Babylonia was the product of the
union of the Akkadians and the Sumerians.  At the outset of this
history stands the figure of Hammurappi (c. 2123-2081 BC), the
conqueror and lawgiver through a reign of forty-three years. 
Under him, the petty waring states of the lower Tigris-Euphrates
valley were forced into unity and peace, and disciplined into
order and security by a historic code of laws.
<P>
 The famous Code of Hammurappi was unearthed at Susa in 1902,
engraved on a diorite cylander which had been carried from Babylon
to Elam about 1100 BC:
<P>
 When the lofty Anu, King of the Anunaki and Bel, Lord of Heaven
and Earth, he who determines the destiny of the land, committed
the rule of all mankind to Marduk; ... when they pronounced the
lofty name of Babylon; when they made it famous among the quarters
of the world and in its midst established an everlasting kingdom
whose foundations were firm as heaven and earth -- at that time,
Anu and Bel called me, Hammurappi, the exalted prince, the worshipper
of the gods, to cause justice to prevail in the land, to destroy
the wicked and the evil, to prevent the strong from oppressing
the weak, ...to enlighten the land and to further the welfare
of the people.
<P>
 Hammurappi, the governor named by Bel, am I, who brought about
plenty and abundance; who made everything for Nippu and Durilu
complete; ... who gave life to the city of Uruk; who supplied
water in abundance to its inhabitants; ... who made the city of
Borsippa beautiful; ... who stored up grain for the mighty Urash;
... who helped his people in time of need; who estabilshes in
security their property in Babylon; the governor of the people,
the servant, whose deeds are pleasing to Anunit.
<P>
 The Code of Hammurappi is of a composit and heterogenous character.
 It mingles the most enlightened of laws with the most barbarous
punishments, and sets trial by ordeal right next to elaborate
judicial proceedures.  Yet, taken as a whole, the two hundred
eight-five laws, arranged in a somewhat haphazard order, form
a law code more advanced that of the Assyrians, a thousand years
later.
<P>
 This famous law code was only one of Hammurappi's accomplishments.
 At his command a great canal was dug between Kish and the Persian
Gulf, thereby irrigating a large area of land, and protecting
the cities of the south from the destructive floods which the
Tigris had the habit of birthing.
<P>
 He built temples and forts.  At Babylon, he constructed a huge
sanctuary for Marduk and his Wife.  They were the national deities.
<P>
 From taxes imposed on the people, he financed the forces of law
and order, and had enough left over to beautify his capital. 
Palaces and temples went up frequently.  A bridge spanned the
Euphrates to let Babylon spread itself along both banks of the
river.  Ships manned by  ninety plied up and down the river.
<P>
 Babylon at this time was on of the richest cities the world had
ever known up till then.  Its people were Semitic, with dark hair
and features.  Most men wore beards.  Both sexes had long hair.
 Both men and women wore perfume.  The common dress for both sexes
was a white linen tunic reaching to the feet.  Women tended to
leave one shoulder bare.  Men would often wear a mantal and robe
with their tunic.  As wealth grew, the poeple developed a taste
for color, dying their garments red on blue or blue on red in
stripes, circles, checks and dots.  Men wore turbins, carried
walking sticks, and wore seals to sign their letters and other
documents.
<P>
 But this same wealth which generated a high civilization also
contributed to its decline, inviting stronger arms and hungrier
mouths to invade.
<P>
<B>Kassites</B>.  Eight years after Hamurrappi's death, the Kassites,
a mountain tribe to the north of Babylonia invaded the land, plundered
it, retreated, and raided it again and again.  Finally, they settled
down in it as conquerors and rulers.  They were a non-Semitic
people, perhaps Indo-European.
<P>
 The Kassites ruled for six hundred years.  It was during their
rule that the Amarna letters were written in which the kinglets
of Babylonia and Syria, having sent modest tribute to imperial
Egypt after the victories of Thutmose III, beg for aid against
rebels and invaders, and quarrel about the value of the gifts
that they exchange with the disdainful Amenhotep III and the absorbed
and neglegent Akhetnaton (Ikhnatan).  It may have been during
this time, too, that the Israelites invaded Canaan (a scenario
dependant upon an early dating for the Exodus, which is not widely
assumed likely).
<P>
 At long last the Kassites were expelled, but disorder continued
in Babylonia for another four hundred years under a series of
obscure rulers with long names that you don't want to know, until
the rising power of Assyria in the north stretched down and brought
Babylonia under the power of the Ninevite kings.
<P>
 When Babylon rebelled, Sennacherib destroyed it nearly completely;
but then his successor Esarhaddon restored it to prosperity.
<P>
 The rise of the Medes weakened Assyria and with their help, Nabopolassar
libertated Babylonia, set up an independant dynasty, and after
his death (Aug. 15, 605 BC), bequeathed this second Babylonian
kingdom to his son, Nebuchadnezzer II -- the Nebuchadnezzer of
Daniel (Daniel was taken captive to Babylon during the summer
of 605 BC).
<P>
 Nebuchadnezzer was to become the most powerful ruler of his time
in the Near East; he was the greatest warrior, statesman, and
builder of all the Babylonian monarchs after Hamurrappi himself.
<P>
 When Egypt conspired with Assyria to reduce Babylon to a vassal
again, Nebuchadnezzer met the Egyptian hosts at Carchemesh and
almost annihilated them  Palestine and Syria then fell under his
dominion and Babylonian merchants controlled the trade that flowed
across western Asia from the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean.
<P>
 Nebuchadnezzer spent the money collected in tolls, tribute, and
taxes in the beautification of his capital and to keep the priests
happy.  He resisted the temptation of most conquerors to be ever
conqueroring; except for the occasional need to remind subject
peoples that they were still subject, he mostly stayed home, focussing
his attentions on making Babylon the unrivaled capital of the
Near East, and the largest and most magnificent metropolis of
the ancient world.  It is not surprising that he admired the city
and asked &quot;is this not the great Babylon that I built?&quot;
<P>
 Herodotus, who saw Babylon a century and a half after Nebuchadnezzer
was dead, described it as &quot;standing upon a spacious plain&quot;,
surrounded by a wall fifty-six miles long, so wise that a four
horse chariot could be driven along the top.  The wall enclosed
an area of two hundred square miles.  Compared to the Old City
of Jerusalem, surrounded by a wall and enclosing an area of one
square mile, Babylon is enormous.  Compared to a major modern
city, it is of course not so impressive.
<P>
 Through the center of Babylon flowed the palm-fringed Euphrates,
busy with commerse.  Most of the buildings of Babylon were brick,
since stone was rare in Mesopotamia.  But the bricks were not
bare.  Rather, they were faced with enamled tiles of blue, yellow,
or white, which were adorned with animal and otaher figures in
glazed relief.  Almost every brick recovered from Babylon bears
an inscription anouncing: &quot;Built by Nebuchadnezzer, king
of Babylon.&quot;
<P>
 The most prominent building in Babylon was the ziggurat, rising
in seven stages of gleaming enamal six hundred fifty feet into
the air.  It was crowned with a shrine containing a massive table
of solid gold, and an ornate bed on which each night, some woman
slept to await the pleasure of the god (or his representative).
<P>
 South of the ziggurat stood the gigantic temple of Marduk, chief
deity of Babylon. Around and below this temple the city spread
itself out in narrow, winding streets, alive with traffic and
bargains, and smells of garbage and humanity.  Connecting the
temples were asphalt covered bricks overlaid with flags of limestone
and red beccia.  Over this the gods could pass without muddying
their feet.  This broad avenue was flanked by walls of colored
tiles on which stood, in low relief, one hundred twenty brightly
enameled lions.  At one end of the Sacred Way, as it was called,
stood the Ishtar Gate, a massive double portal of tiles, adorned
with enameled flowers and animals.  Six hundred yards north of
the great ziggurat rose a mound called Kasr, on which Nebucahdnezzer
built the most imposing of his palaces.
<P>
 Nearby, supported on a succession of superimposed circular colonades,
were the famous Hanging Gardens. Nebuchadnezzer is reported to
have built them for one of his wives, the daughter of Cyaxares,
the King of the Medes.  This princess, so the story goes, unaccustomed
to the hot sun and dust of Babylon, pined away for the green of
her native land.  So, Nebuchadnezzer made this beautiful and lush
garden to ease her homesickness.  
<P>
 The topmost terrace was covered with rich soil to a depth of
many feet, providing space and nourishment not mearly for various
flowering plants, but for large trees.  Hydrolic machines, manned
by slaves, carried water from the Euphrates to the highest tier
of the gardens.  There, seventy-five feet above the ground, in
the cool shade of tall trees, and surrounded by exotic shrubs
and fragrant flowers, the women of the royal harem walked unveiled,
secure from the common eye, while in the plains below, the common
man and woman plowed, wove, built, carried burdens and reproduced
their kind, unable to partake of the luxury afforded kings and
their wives.
<P>
<B>Economy.</B>  The government in Mesopotamia never succeeded
in establishing such economic order as that which the pharaohs
achieved in Egypt.  Commerse was harrassed with a multiplicity
of dangers and tolls.  The merchant did not know which to fear
more: the robbers that might attack him along the road, or the
towns and baronies which exacted heavy fees from him for the priviledge
of using their less than safe roads.
<P>
 It was safer, where possible, to take the great national highway,
the Euphrates, which Nebuchadnezzer had made navigable from the
Persian Gulf all the way to Thapsacus.
<P>
 The Babylonians had no coinage, but even before Hamurrappi they
used, besides barly and wheat, ingots of gold and silver as standards
of value and mediums of exchange.  The metal was unstamped and
had to be weighed for each transaction.
<P>
 Loans were made in goods or precious metals, at a very high rate
of interest, even worse than most modern credit card rates:  twenty
percent for loans of gold or silver and thirty-three percent for
loans of goods to be repaid in kind.  Although there were no banks,
certain powerful families carried on from generation to generation
in the business of lending money.  They were, in some respects,
like modern loan sharks.
<P>
 Babylonia was essentially a commercial civilization.  Most of
the documents that have survived are business related: sales,
loans, contracts, partnerships, comissions, exchanges, agreements,
promissary notes, etc.  They apparently were prospering, and they
were filled with the spirit of materialism.
<P>
 On a darker note, slavery was an important part of Babylonian
life (as it was for most nations through the eighteenth century
and even into the ninteenth century AD).  Slaves were aquired
from captives taken in battle, slave raids carried out upon foreign
states by marauding bedouins, and from the reproductive enthusiasm
of the slaves themselves.  Slaves were inexpensive, running the
equivalent of twenty to sixty-five dollars for women and fifty
to a hundred dollars for men.  Most physical labor was performed
by slaves; female slaves, of course, were used as breeders and
sex objects.
<P>
 Slaves and whatever property they might have belonged entirely
to their masters.  A slave might be sold or pledged for debt;
he might be put to death if his master simply thought him or her
less valuable alive than dead.  If a slave escaped, no one could
legally harbor him or her and there were usually nice rewards
posted for his or her capture.
<P>
<B>Kings and Priests of Babylon.</B>  The power of the king was
limited by the law, the aristocracy, and the clergy.  The king
was the agent of the city's god.  Taxation was in the name of
that god, and the money went into the treasuries of the temple.
<P>
 The king became king when he was invested with royal authority
by the priests.  All the glamor of the supernatural hedged about
the throne and made rebellion a colossal impiety which risked
not only life, but also the eternal soul.  
<P>
 The wealth of the temples grew from generation to generation,
as the rich shared their dividends with the gods.  The kings,
feeling a special need for divine forgiveness, built temples,
equipped them with furniture, food, and slaves, deeded to them
great tracts of land, and assigned them an anual income from the
state.  The concept of separating church and state was not even
imagined and would have been dismissed as idiotic if ever broached.
<P>
 Poor as well as rich turned over to the tmeples as much as they
thought profitable of their earthly gains.  As the priests could
not directly use or consume this wealth, they turned it into productive
or investment capital.  Unsurprisingly, much of the agricultural,
manufacturing, and financing of Babylonia became the pervue of
the priests.
<P>
 Not only did they have huge land holdings, they held vast quantities
of slaves and controlled hundreds of paid laborers.  These people,
slave and free, were put to work at various trades ranging from
the performance of music to the brewing of beer.
<P>
<B>The Gods Themselves. </B> Who were the divinities of this empire?
 An official census of the gods late in the ninth century placed
their number at around 65,000.  You will not be required to memorize
all of them for the exam.   Why so many gods?  Every town had
one, as did most professions and daily tasks.  
<P>
 The gods were derived from the Sumerian panthon.  Transcendance
was not a pronounced part of the Babylonians' concept of deity.
 Rather, immanence dominated.  Most of the gods lived on earth
in the temples, had large appetites for food and drink, and made
nocturnal visits to pious women, giving them unexpected children.
<P>
 The oldest gods in the Babylonian pantheon were the astronomical
deities:
<P>
 <blockquote>1. Anu -- the immovable firmament
<P>
 2. Shamash -- the sun
<P>
 3. Nannar -- the moon
<P>
 4. Baal -- the earth, into whose bosom all Babyonians returned
upon death.</blockquote>
<P>
 Additionally, each family had its own household gods, to whom
prayers might be said and to whom libations were poured each morning
and evening.  Every individual had a protective deity to keep
him or her from harm and to give him or her joy; this concept,
of course, passed ultimately into the Zoroastrian (a Persian,
dualistic religion) concept of guardian angels, which then passed
on to popular Christianity's concept of guardian angels.
<P>
 The multiplicity of gods created some confusion, and so periodically
reform movements would simplify the system by interpreting minor
gods as forms or attributes of major deities, thus reducing the
total number of divine beings.  In this way the chief god of the
city of Babylon, Marduk (a sun god), was tunred into the chief
of all Babylonian deities.
<P>
 Another deity of importance was Ishtar (also called Astarte by
the Greeks and Asherah  or Astoreth by the Jewish people).  She
was very similar to the Egyptian goddess Isis, the Greek goddess
Aphrodite, and the Roman Venus.  Herodotus writes of Ishtar:
<P>
 <blockquote>There is one custom amongst these people which is wholly shameful: every woman who is a native of the country must once in her life go and sit in the temple of Aphrodite [that is, Ishtar] and there give herself to a strange man.  Many of the rich women, who are too proud to mix with the rest, drive to the temple in covered carriages with a whole host of servants following behind, and there wait; most however, sit in the precinct of the temple with a band of plaitd string round their heads -- a a great crowd they are, what with some sitting there, others arriving, others going away -- and through them all gangways are marked off running in every direction for the men to pass along and make their choice.  Once a woman has taken ehr seat she is not allowed to go home until a man has thrown a silver coin into her lap and taken ehr outside to lie with her.  As he throws the coin, the man has to say, "In the name of the goddess Mylitta" -- that being the Assyrian name for aphrodite.  The value of the coin is of no consequence; once thrown it becomes sacred, andthe law forbids that it should ever be refused.  The woman has no privilege of choice -- she must go with the first man who throws her the money.  When she has lain with him, her duty to the goddess is discharged and she may go home, after which it will be impossible to seduce her by any offer, however large.  Tall, handsome women soon manage to get home again, but the ugly ones stay a long time before they can fulfil the condition which the law demands, some of them, indeed, as much as three or four years.  There is a custom similar to this in parts of Cyprus. (Herodotus, <i>The Histories</i>, translated by Aubrey de Selincourt.  Baltimore: Penguine Books, 1954, pp. 94-95)
 </blockquote>
<P>
<B>Language and Writing.</B>  The language of the Babylonians
was Semitic, making it not too difficult to learn.  But the writing
system, however, was something else entirely.  Derived from the
Sumerians, it is a nightmarish thing; the symbols stand for syllables
or entire words, and worse, they are polyvalent, meaning that
they can usually be read more than one way, depending on context,
genre, and time period.  Reading a Babylonian text is like trying
to do a rebus.  What's a rebus?  Here's an example in English:
<P>
<IMG SRC="rhebus.gif">
 <P>Putting this in normal English orthography, you would write:
&quot;I believe you are a great manager of men.&quot;
<P>
 The Babylonian cuneiform writing system is a combination of signs,
some of which are Sumerian logograms representing an entire Babylonian
word; some are symbols representing a syllable within a word.
 And any one symbol can have a different sound or meaning simply
depending upon the context, as in our example above, the &quot;eye&quot;
could also stand for an eye, just as easily as it stands for an
&quot;I&quot;, and the &quot;bee&quot; could be the insect, a
verb, or a part of some other word.
<P>
<B>The End of Babylon</B>
<P>
 Nebuchadnezzar, after a long reign of victory and prosperity,
after beautifying his city with roads and palaces and errecting
fifty-four temples to the gods, became ill with a strange insanity.
 Thinking himself an animal, he walked on all fours and ate grass.
<P>
 In the anals of Babylonia, his name disappears from the records
for four years.  It reappears for a moment, and then, in 562 BC,
he died.
<P>
 Within thirty years of his death, his empire crumbled to pieces.
<P>
 Nabonidus, who held the throne seventeen years, much preferred
archeology to government, and devoted himself to excavating the
antiquities of Sumer while his own realm went to ruin.  The army
fell into disorder; people were devoted to business, trade and
pleasure, and forgot the art of war.  The priests usurped more
and more of the royal power.  Babylon became ever richer, making
it a tempting target for invaders.  Unfortunately, they did not
adequately protect themselves.
<P>
 When Cyrus and the Persian Empire stood a the gates, the anti-clericals
of Babylon connived to open the gates of the city to him and wealcomed
his domination.  Nabonidus' son, Belshazzar, left in charge of
the Babylonian government was busy at the time the Persians came;
he was having a party.  The Persians crashed his party and killed
him.  The date: October 12, 539 BC.  For two centuries thereafter,
Persia ruled Babylonia as part of the greatest empire that history
had known up to that moment.
<P>
 Then Alexander the Great captured the Persian Empire, creating
an even greater kingdom -- which lasted only briefly, until he
drank himself to death at the age of thirty in the palace of Nebuchadnezzar.
 The date: June 13, 323 BC.
<P>
 It was from Babylon that the Greeks brought to their city-states
and then to Rome and ultimately us, the foundations of mathematics,
astronomy, medicine, grammar, lexicography, archeology, history,
and philosophy.  The Greek names for the metals and constellations,
for weights and measures, for musical instruments, and many drugs,
are translations -- and often, just transliterations -- of Babylonian
terms.
