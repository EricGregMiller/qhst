<B>The Book of 2 Peter</B> 
<P>
<B>I. Title</B> 
<P>
The title comes from the name of the author, Peter; it is the
second of two letters written by Peter.
<P>
<B>II. Author and Setting</B> 
<P>
The letter was written by Peter according to 1:1:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Simon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
To those who through the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus
Christ have received a faith as precious as ours:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The authorship of 2 Peter has been widely questioned in scholarly
circles, and the majority consensus is that the letter, though
claiming to have been written by Peter, actually was not.
<P>
Arguments in favor of Peterine authorship are as follows:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
1. 2 Peter 1:1 claims authorship for Peter; to reject Peter's
authorship would necessitate rejecting the letter as scripture,
since it would, with the first two words, be lying.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
2. There were pseudonymous works circulating in the early church
that claimed to be written by Peter (The Apocalypse of Peter,
The Gospel of Peter, The Acts of Peter, The Teaching of Peter,
The Letter of Peter to James, The Preaching of Peter) but they
were never accepted by the church as authoritative. 2 Peter does
not resemble these clearly pseudopigraphic works either in style
or content -- that is, it lacks Gnostic and Montanist influence,
either as polemic for or against.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
3. Differences in style between 1 and 2 Peter can be explained
by noting that Silas helped Peter with 1 Peter (1 Peter 5:12),
while no such help is indicated in this second letter.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
There are many similarities between 2 Peter and Jude, especially
the description and denunciation of false teachers. This has lead
to the conclusion that there is probably some kind of literary
or oral dependence, with 2 Peter most likely making use of Jude,
rather than the other way around. It is also a possibility that
both Jude and 2 Peter make use of a third, unknown source.
<P>
Like the first letter, the second was probably written from Rome,
sometime between AD 64 and 68.
