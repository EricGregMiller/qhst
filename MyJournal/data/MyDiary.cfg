My Journal	<img src=images/GirlLogo.jpg align=right><CR><LF>Robin, I set this up for you because I know you are journaling. I hope this is a tool you may be able to use. You had mentioned that Dandi and your wife read your journal. - The photo on the right can be replaced with your photo or none at all. See you tonight!
