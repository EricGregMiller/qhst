<h1><B>Saul and David</B></h1>
<P>
 There was other strong pressure to change the government of Israel
to a kingship besides the threat of Israel's neighbors, especially
the Philistines, whose victories had resulted in the destruction
of the central sanctuary at Shiloh and the disintegration of the
amphictyonic organization.  Although Samuel, as a Judge and a
prophet, had signally distinguished himself, he was now old, and
his sons displayed none of his honesty nor competency (1 Sam.
8:1-9).  Accordingly, the elders of Israel came to the aging prophet-judge
and demanded that a visible king be appointed over them, so that
they might be like the well-organized nations surrounding them
and that they might have a leader who could conduct them to victory
over their pressing foes.
<P>
 Although the ultimate organization of the Hebrew kingdom with
an earthly monarch as the representative of Yahweh had long been
envisioned prophetically and in the divine foreknowledge (Gen.
17:6, 16; and 35:11 and Deuteronomy 17:14-20), yet this people
were not guiltless in demanding a king at this crisis.  The spirit
in which they did so was plainly irreligious.  They lacked abiding
faith in God, without which the rule of Yahweh as a theocratic
king was impossible.  Under the circumstances, their action in
asking for a human ruler was tantamount to turning away from faith
in the invisible God to confidence in a visible leader.  The moral
problem connected with what they did is consequently not to be
explained as the result of divergent and contradictory sources
indicative of the composite character of 1 Samuel, each source
giving a &quot;diametrically opposed attitude to the monarchy.&quot;
 Any divine approval or permission of their choice of a king was
a mere accommodation to human weakness and sin.
<P>
<B>The Early Fortunes of the Kingdom</B>
<P>
 Saul the Benjaminite (c. 1020- c. 1000 BC) was chosen as Israel's
first ruler.  As king he was unable to advance beyond a loose
political confederacy, mainly because of his innate weakness of
character, and he left an unfinished task to be completed by his
brilliantly successful successor, David.
<P>
 
<P>
<B>Saul's Early Exploits</B>
<P>
 Saul's initial victory at Jabesh Gilead over the Ammonites (1
Samuel 11:1-14) was of great importance in establishing him in
the minds of the people as God's chosen leader, as one &quot;capable
of taking up the mantle of the old Judges, one inspired of the
Spirit, who could fight and win battles for Israel.&quot;
<P>
 Saul not only pushed back the Ammonites in Transjordan, but by
his victories over the Philistines, notably as a follow-up of
Jonathan's brilliant rout of the Philistine garrison at Michmash
(1 Samuel 14:1-46), he also broke the Philistine monopoly on iron.
 The Philistines did their best to see that the Israelites did
not learn how to forge this new metal. &quot;Now there was no
smith to be found throughout all the land of Israel; for the Philistines
said, 'lest the Hebrews make themselves swords or spears,' but
every one of the Israelites went down to the Philistines to sharpen
his plowshare, his mattock, his ax, or his sickle.&quot; (1 Samuel
13:19-20).
<P>
 In the eleventh century BC iron was just coming into general
use in Palestine, as excavations have shown, and the iron monopoly
was not only an incalculable help to Philistine superiority in
arms, but a valuable commercial consideration as well, as the
Hittites, who seemed to  have started the monopoly, discovered
two centuries earlier.  The fact that the Israelites had to go
to Philistia to have iron tools made or repaired was inconvenient
enough, but it was even more expensive.  The charge for sharpening
is said to have been &quot;a pim for the plowshares and for the
mattocks, and a third of a shekel for sharpening the ax and for
setting the goads.&quot; (1 Samuel 19:21). The weight in question,
&quot;a pim&quot; (Hebrew <I>pym</I>) had been completely forgotten
even in antiquity, but pre-exilic Jewish weights were inscribed
&quot;p-y-m&quot;, i.e., &quot;two thirds of a shekel&quot;. 
It is needless to say that two-thirds of a shekel of silver was
a pretty stiff price to pay for a single plow tip not over eight
or ten inches long.
<P>
 Throughout the period of the Judges the Israelites remained comparatively
poor because of a lack of iron for farming implements, nails,
and weapons of war.  They were unable to drive the Canaanites
out of the plains because the latter had chariots of iron (Joshua
17:18, Judges 1:19 and 4:2-3) and certainly weapons of iron. 
Excavations have shown that the Philistines possessed iron weapons
and jewelry, while the Israelites apparently did not.  Even as
late as the time of Saul it is emphasized that &quot;on the day
of battle there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand
of any of the people with Saul and Jonathan; but Saul and Jonathan
his son had them.&quot; (1 Samuel 13:22)
<P>
 When Saul and David broke the power of the Philistines, the iron-smelting
formula became public property, and the metal was popularized
in Israel.  The result was an economic revolution, making possible
a higher standard of living.  The struggle against the Philistines
was, accordingly, a war of survival, justly celebrated in song
and story.
<P>
Saul's Fortress at Gibeah
<P>
 Of particular interest is Saul's home town, Gibeah of Benjamin,
which figures prominently in the narratives of his reign in 1
Samuel.  It is located in the hill country about four miles north
of Jerusalem and about two miles south of Ramah.  The present
site is called Tel el-Ful, which long ago was identified with
Saul's city by Edward Robinson (an early explorer in the Holy
Land); it was subsequently excavated by W.F. Albright in 1922
and 1933.
<P>
 At the bottom of the mound Albright found the first fortress
of Gibea, which showed traces of destruction by fire, so Albright
identified it with the destruction mentioned in Judges 20:40.
 Just above this fortress were the remains of a second, the most
elaborate structure discovered in the mound.  Its outer wall was
about six feet thick and was defended by a sloping base.  It was
furnished with two stories and contained a massive stone staircase.
 Albright identified this with Saul's stronghold.  The structure,
measuring 170 by 155 feet, with its casemated walls and separated
by fonded corner towers, illustrates the construction of this
period.
<P>
 On top of Saul's structure was a third and somewhat smaller fortress,
chracterized by a series of stone piers.  These piers connect
it with the time of the Monarchy.  Some connect it with the building
activity of King Asa at Geba of Benjamine (1 Kings 15:22).  But
in the light of Isaiah 10:29, Geba and Gibeah of Saul are not
identical.  
<P>
 At any rate, this citidel suffered destruction by fire, perhaps
in the Syro-Ephraimite War (cf. Isaiah 7).  After a further lapse
of time, another fortress was built on the ruins of all these,
which is dated by pottery to the Macabbean period.
<P>
<B>The Rustic Nature of Saul's Reign</B>
<P>
 Saul's kingdom was primitive by the later standards of David
and especially Solomon.  The principle building at Gibeah, from
Saul's era, with massive stone construction and eep walls, &quot;was
like a dungeon rather than a royal residence, in comparison with
the Canaanite masonry with whch Solomon later graced Jerusalem.&quot;
 Saul's general cultural background is similarly evaluated by
Albright: &quot;...Saul was only a rustic chieftain, as far as
architecture and the amenities of life were concerned.&quot; 

<P>
 Moreover, what was true of Saul was in a general way culturally
true of all the Israelite tribes throughout the period of the
Judges and up to the efflorescende of industry and the arts and
sciences in the prosperous Davidic-Solomonic era.  Israelite poverty
and rusticity of life in the pre-monarchic period are fully demonstrated
by the excavations.
<P>
<B>Saul's Failure as King</B>
<P>
 William A. Irwin aptly characterizes King Saul as &quot;of the
independent spirit that would not be servile to any priest-prophet
however revered.&quot;  This disposition, however, was diametrically
opposed to the Near Eastern concept of the king as the representative
of the national diety (in Israel's case, of Yahweh, the onle and
only true God).
<P>
<B>Saul's Self Will</B>
<P>
 As a leader, it was Saul's first concern to ascertain the will
of Yahweh through the ordained means of his honored prophet, Samuel,
and, having clearly apprehended it, to execute it fully.  This
is precisely what Saul failed to do and thereby demonstrated clearly
his unfitness to be God's representative.
<P>
 The king's first example of self-will was his intrusion into
the priest's office.  Severely pressed by the Philistines, restive
under Samuel's delay to meet him at Gilgal, and threatened by
the desertion of a great number of his followers, Saul committed
a very grave offense in offering a burnt offering, which only
a priest might do, according to the Law of God.  This act of disobedience
was the first step in his rejection as the founder of a dynasty
(1 Samuel 13:13-14).
<P>
 Later, after Saul's victory over the Philistines, which was occasioned
by Jonathan's signal valor at Michmash (1 Samuel 13:15-14:46),
Samuel directed Saul to wage a war of extermination against the
Amalekites.  Saul undertook the war, but failed to exterminate
the enemy. For this second act of disobedience, by which he fu;rther
proved he could not be strusted to act as God's instrument, but
was dominated by his own will in God's kingdom, he was emphatically
rejected from being king (1 Samuel 15:1-35), and Samuel was sent
to Bethlehem to annoint David (1 Samuel 16:1-13).
<P>
 It is best to see these two events as coterminous with Saul's
rejection as king, with his rejection the result of these two
acts of disobedience, not just one or the other.
<P>
<B>Structure of 1 Samuel</B>
<P>
<B>I. Establishing the Problem</B> 
<P>
 The documentary hypothesis and much of modern higher critical
theories derive from the inherent complexity and odd structuring
of the Hebrew narrative as found in the Bible. Evangelicals will
generally reject these higher critical techniques in favor of
a more traditional understanding of the text, but in so doing,
evangelicals often do not effectively confront and explain the
complexities that created the critical reactions in the first
place. The creative failure results from western myopia when it
comes to the text. Inevitably the Bible is seen through the eyes
of western civilization; certain presuppositions are so obviously
and inherently correct to a westerner that his bias is invisible
to him. Westerners expect texts and documents to follow a chronological
arrangement, especially when the document in question is a narrative
telling a story. Because of this expectation, not only is it possible
to misunderstand the Bible, but such questionable ideas as the
documentary hypothesis are easily postulated as the recalcitrant
text is forced into an alien and ill-fitting garment. McCarter
points out the problem in relation to 1 Samuel:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The narratives about Samuel, Saul, and David that make up our
book have a heterogeneous appearance even to the untrained eye.
Numerous internal thematic tensions, duplications, and contradictions
stand in the way of a straightforward reading of the story. The
figure of Samuel dominates the first three chapters, then vanishes
suddenly and completely in cc 4-6, only to return again in c 7.
In c 8 kingship is depicted as wholly offensive to Yahweh, while
in cc 9-10 the first king is anointed at Yahweh's command. Saul
becomes king by lottery in 10:17-27 but, apparently, by popular
proclamation in c 11. He seems to be rejected by Yahweh not once
but twice (in cc 16 and 17). There are two accounts of David's
betrothal to a daughter of Saul (c 18), two of his defection to
the Philistine king of Gath (cc 21 and 27), and two of his refusal
to take Saul's life (cc 24 and 26).
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The pioneering scholars of the early nineteenth century (Eichhorn,
Thenius), aware of these inconsistencies and mindful of the successes
of parallel source theories in dealing with similar problems in
other books of the Bible, posited the existence of discrete strands
within the Samuel narratives.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
 G. Herbert Livingston in his book, <I>The Pentateuch in its Cultural
Environment,</I> makes an interesting and valid observation:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Many form critics have castigated scholars for looking at and
interpreting the OT from the standpoint of Western thought patterns
and customs. Yet the names give to the Pentateuchal literary types
and the criteria for isolating and labeling these types are Western
to the core. The observation that names for type do not often
occur in the Pentateuch does not justify this procedure. Efforts
must be made to devise labels that accord with and arise out of
the biblical materials themselves.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
 There is a delightful consistency in the nature of the critical
problems throughout the Bible; rather than explaining the difficulties
as the result of conflicting sources, or by simply ignoring them,
perhaps they should instead be recognized as an inherent characteristic
of Hebrew narrative; it seems an obvious solution. The problems
so well recognized by the critics, if one thinks of it, are remarkably
similar to what is taken for granted as normal in Hebrew poetry:
for instance, the parallelism, which, by its nature, is repetitious.
So, perhaps in narrative something of this method of structuring
thought can be recognized.
<P>
<B>II. Summary of the Solution</B> 
<P>
 What will be demonstrated, therefore, is that chronology is <I>not</I>
the overriding structural principle in Hebrew writing (and this
would include the New Testament as well, because, though written
in Greek, it was not primarily composed <I>by</I> Greeks). Rather,
chronology is subsumed by more important principles, at least
in Hebrew thought: namely, theme and content.
<P>
 While chronology is not lacking, it is not the only, most important
or overriding sequencer of the material. Rather, other things
can become more important, thereby skewing the chronology in unexpected
ways. Perhaps this is not so surprising. After all, the very nature
of the Hebrew verbal system is suggestive of the possibility;
instead of tense, Hebrew has aspects which describe action in
terms of completion or incompletion, rather than in terms of past,
present and future. This outlook cannot have avoided having an
impact on narrative techniques. Yet, in the teaching of the language,
the true nature of the aspect system in Hebrew is commonly obscured.
For instance, Menahem Mansoor, in his book <I>Biblical Hebrew
Step by Step</I>, states:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Strictly speaking, Biblical (i.e. Classical) Hebrew has no tense
similar to those used in English, French, or German. The action
is regarded as either <I>complete</I> or <I>incomplete</I>. Hence
most scholars prefer to call a completed action <I>perfect</I>
and an incompleted action <I>imperfect</I>....
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The use of the Hebrew tenses is relatively easy to learn....Thus,
many different types of past action are expressed by the Hebrew
perfect tense. This reductionism is largely true of the Hebrew
imperfect tense in expressing various types of future (and sometimes
also present) action.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
 Even Gesenius relegates a discussion of the peculiar nature of
the verbal system to a footnote (p. 125), and little if any discussion
is ever made in any grammar on the oddities that such an outlook
on the world would play in narrative or poetic structures.
<P>
 Rather than stressing the peculiarity of the Hebrew verbal system,
the attempt is made to force it into a familiar mode, so that
students are invariably left with the impression that the imperfect
is present or future and perfect is past tense, with no awareness
of the non-chronological character of the verbal system. Rather
than adjusting minds to the Hebrew mold, Hebrew is pressed into
a Western European mold -- thereby obscuring what is actually
transpiring in the text.
<P>
 Hebrew narrative structure contains what can be called a thematic
expansion of topic -- a format that commonly replaces chronology
as an organizational principle even in straightforward narrative.
This structuring can be illustrated in various portions of the
Bible, both Old and New Testaments, and is especially illuminating
when it comes to the difficulties mentioned by McCarter in 1 Samuel.
Once noticed, this non-chronological structuring principle becomes
rather obvious throughout the scriptures.
<P>
<B>III. Preliminary Examples</B> 
<P>
<B>A. Genesis 1:1-2:25</B> 
<P>
 Genesis 1:1 through 2:25 takes the following basic pattern:
<P>
1. 1:1 In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
2. 1:2-2:4a How God created the heavens and the earth.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
3. 2:4b-2:25 How God created man and woman.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
 A discussion of this pattern follows:
<P>
 1. &quot;In the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth&quot;
(1:1-2) is the opening or summary statement regarding the passage,
similar to what one finds in the first paragraph of a newspaper
story.
<P>
 2. How God created the heavens and the Earth 1:3-2:4a; in the
passage that follows, the author of Genesis now expands upon his
statement of theme. In detail, he describes the way that God went
about creating the heavens and the Earth.
<P>
 Notice the tendency to arrange by theme rather than chronology
continues with the six days. Their thematic arrangement has been
pointed out before, for instance by Derek Kidner in his commentary
on Genesis for the <I>Tyndale Old Testament Commentaries</I>.
<P>
 Notice that on days 1-3, empty places are prepared, while on
days 4-6 the inhabitants to fill those empty places are made.
<P>
 1. Light=day/dark=night  4. Sun for day/moon, stars for night
<P>
 2. water below/above    5. fish below/birds above
<P>
 3. dry ground/plants   6. land animals/people
<P>
 3. How God created man and woman 2:4b-3:25
<P>
 The narrative has finally moved from the simple opening that
God created the universe, through how he did it (a general introduction
describing the six days), until finally the author brings the
reader to the details, hinted at in 1:26-30, of how the human
race was created. In 1:26-30, the narrative explains that God
created both man and woman, and that they are both in the image
of God. In the passage of 2:4b-2:25, details regarding the creative
process are revealed; rather than man and woman being created
simultaneously, as a reading of 1:26-30 alone might intimate,
the author explains that Adam was created first, that he studied
the animals and &quot;named&quot; them, finally learning for his
efforts that unlike all the rest of God's creatures, he had no
mate. This fact determined, God anesthetized Adam and performed
surgery; through the use of some of Adam's tissue, God produced
a female clone to be his mate. Adam recognized her and named her
and took her as his wife. The details and the perspective of 2:4b-2:25
are different and expand dramatically from the previous account
given in 1:26- 30. Notice the following pattern:
<P>
 A In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth (1:1)
-- a summary statement
<P>
  B God creates the heavens and the earth (1:2-25)
<P>
   C God creates humans (1:26-30)
<P>
    D God rested (1:31-2:4a)
<P>
 A' God created the heavens and the earth (2:4b) -- a summary
statement
<P>
  B' God creates the earth (2:5-6)
<P>
   C' God creates man (2:7)
<P>
  B' God creates the Garden/Rivers (2:8-14)
<P>
   C' God establishes man, plans for woman (2:15-18)
<P>
  B' God creates animals (2:19-20)
<P>
   C' God creates woman (2:21-25)
<P>
<B>B. Jonah 3:5-9</B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(5) The Ninevites believed God. They declared a fast, and all
of them, from the greatest to the least, put on sackcloth. (6)
When the news reached the king of Nineveh, he rose from his throne,
took off his royal robes, covered himself with sackcloth and sat
down in the dust. (7) Then he issued a proclamation in Nineveh:
&quot;By the decree of the king and his nobles: Do not let any
man or beast, herd or flock, taste anything; do not let them eat
or drink. (8) But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth.
Let everyone call urgently on God. Let them give up their evil
ways and their violence. (9) Who knows? God may yet relent and
with compassion turn from his fierce anger so that we will not
perish.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
 Jonah displays another example of this same thematic structuring.
Jonah 3:5-9 is a description of Nineveh's reaction to Jonah's
preaching. 3:5 gives a summary of the response of the city to
Jonah's preaching, while 3:6-9 gives specific details about what
happened and how. If an attempt is made to read this as strictly
a chronological description of what occurred, a certain confusion
results. Verse five recounts how the people repented and wore
sack cloth. If verses 6-9 follow chronologically, then why does
the king order his people to do what they've already done?
<P>
However, if the thematic arrangement is recognized, the problems
evaporate, and the narrative is perfectly clear and consistent.
Look at the pattern:
<P>
 A The Ninevites believed God (3:5a)
<P>
  B They declared a fast (3:5b)
<P>
   C They put on sackcloth, from the greatest to the least (3:5c)
<P>
   C' King puts on sackcloth (3:6)
<P>
  B' Proclamation that no one is to eat or drink (3:7)
<P>
   C' Man and beast covered with sackcloth (3:8a)

 A' Let them call urgently on God and repent (3:8b-9)

book of Ecclesiastes seeks to discuss are expressed. In the verses
that follow, he does exactly what he has indicated, first discussing
what is good -- repetitiously, as is the nature of Hebrew poetry
-- and then turning to the second half at verse 11 and repetitiously
describing how meaningless it is. This is standard Hebrew pattern,
and not at all odd, unless one were to insist on a western outlook
in narrative or poetic techniques.

The first line of the pericope establishes the structure for what
follows; the first half of the line, dealing with the enticement
of sinners is expanded upon in the next four verses. At that point,
there is a shift, and the second half of verse ten, about &quot;not
going&quot; is then expanded upon for the same length of time.
<P>
<B>E. Joshua 15:13-19</B> 
<P>
The book of Joshua falls into six parts easily enough:
<P>
 I. The Entry into Canaan 1-6
<P>
 II. Incident at Ai and renewal of the covenant 7-8
<P>
 III. Conquest of the South 9-10
<P>
 IV. Conquest of the North 11-12
<P>
 V. Division of the Land 13-22
<P>
 VI. Farewell and Death of Joshua 23-24
<P>
Section V is devoted to the distribution of the land among the
tribes. The story of Caleb and his daughter appears in 15:13-19.
This same story is repeated near the beginning of Judges (1:1-15),
which explicitly informs us that Joshua died before the incident
with Caleb occurred. Yet in Joshua, we do not see the death of
Joshua until the end of the book (Joshua 24:28-30).
<P>
There is no difficulty, however, if it is understood that theme
will override chronology in the arranging of a narrative, even
a story, because the incident with Caleb is described in a section
of the book devoted to the theme of the conquest. Caleb's story
of the conquest of Hebron fits in perfectly at that point thematically,
although certainly not chronologically. But chronology was subsumed
by the theme.
<P>
<B>F. Judges</B> 
<P>
The structure of Judges, likewise, is probably not chronological
-- especially chapters 17-21. The last chapters of the book do
not necessarily follow chapters 1-16; instead, they perhaps offer
a snapshot of what transpired in the land during those times when
there were no judges. They illustrate the phrase &quot;there was
no king; everyone did what was right in his own eyes.&quot;
<P>
I. The Time of the Elders 1:1-2:10
<P>
II. The Time of the Judges 2:11-16:31
<P>
III. A Picture of Anarchy 17-21.
<P>
2:11-3:6 is a summary of the entire period of the Judges, with
3:7-16:31 expanding upon 2:14-3:6 and 17-21 being an expansion
of 2:11-13, creating a chaiastic structure for the book.
<P>
A 2:11-13
<P>
B 2:14-3:6
<P>
B' 3:7-16:31
<P>
A' 17-21
<P>
It is interesting to notice the common phrase used four times
in 17-21: &quot;Israel had no king&quot;. It appears in 17:6,
18:1, 19:1 and 21:25.
<P>
<B>G. Miscellaneous</B> 
<P>
In the New Testament, this structuring principle arranges the
beatitudes in Matthew 5:3-11: &quot;the poor in spirit&quot; begins
the narrative in 5:3; the lines beneath (4-11) are simply expansions
and details of who and what the poor in spirit are. John's gospels
and letters begin to make greater sense. In Revelation, words
that seem to describe the end of the world are repeated in 6:12-17,
11:15-19, and 16:17-21, not to mention 18-22. This is not strange,
if a thematic rather than a chronological arrangement is recognized,
however.
<P>
<B>IV. The Problem of 1 Samuel </B>
<P>
Consider, then, the arrangement of the David/Saul narrative in
1 Samuel. McCarter points out that Saul was rejected twice by
Yahweh and that there are also two accounts of how David entered
Saul's service.
<P>
How does the theory of &quot;topical expansion of topic&quot;
easily explain these difficulties?
<P>
The narrative is certainly puzzling in its current form, <I>if</I>
it is assumed to have a strict chronological arrangement. In 13:7-15
Samuel tells Saul that his kingdom will not endure, but will be
given to another. In 15:7-34, Samuel tells Saul that God has rejected
him and given the kingdom to another. In 16:14-23 David enters
Saul's service, playing the harp for him in order to make him
feel better (evil spirit perhaps better translated as &quot;depression&quot;
based on the fact that Hebrew &quot;spirit&quot; demonstrably
means &quot;emotion&quot; as in Genesis 45:27, paralleling the
English &quot;lifting his spirit&quot;; see also Num. 14:24, Deut.
2:30, Judges 9:23, 1 Sam. 18:1). Yet, come 17:55-18:2, after slaying
Goliath, Saul seems not to have previously met David -- and David
<I>then</I> enters Saul's service.
<P>
If a topical/thematic arrangement of the narrative is recognized,
these apparent problems are relatively easily dealt with. If one
insists on chronology as the sole, or most important structuring
criterion, then the problem remains and the interpreter must choose
either to accept the documentary hypothesis, or else explain away
the difficulties as not really present.
<P>
So how does it work here?
<P>
A 13:7-9 Saul in Gilgal; performs sacrifice!
<P>
B 13:10-11a Samuel arrives, questions Saul.
<P>
C 13:11b-12 Saul's response.
<P>
D 13:13-14 Samuel's rebuke
<P>
A' 15:1-7 Saul sent against Amelekites
<P>
15:8-9 Saul spares Agag and the best of the sheep and cattle
<P>
B' 15:10-14 Samuel questions Saul
<P>
C' 15:15 Saul's response
<P>
D' 15:16-19 Samuel's rebuke
<P>
C'A' 15:20-21 Saul's response; animals for sacrifice!
<P>

<P>
C' 15:24-25 Saul's response
<P>
D' 15:26-29 Samuel's rebuke
<P>
C' 15:30 Saul's response
<P>
E' 15:31-33 Samuel kills Agag
<P>
15:34-35 Summary; Samuel leaves.
<P>
The key to the linkage of these at first apparently separate incidents
is the mention of animals for sacrifice in 13:7-9 and 15:20-21.
The perspective of the two descriptions is somewhat different,
but notice that the passage in 13 is much shorter and much more
condensed than the account of 15, which can therefore be taken
an expansion of the earlier account (notice that this expansion
of topic matches the pattern observed in Genesis 1 and 2, as in
comparing 1:26-30 with 2:4b-2:25).
<P>
Now notice the overall structure of 13-15:
<P>
A 13:3-7a -- Jonathan attacked the Philistine outpost
<P>
B 13:7b-22 The account of Saul's rejection
<P>
A' 13:23-14:14 -- Description of Jonathan's attack on the
<P>
Philistine outpost, much expanded from the account in 13:3-7a
<P>
C 14:15-23 -- Summary of general Israelite attack on Philistines
<P>
C' 14:24-48 -- Specific details of the campaign summarized in
14:15-23, with additional information of Jonathan's exploits.
<P>
D 14:49-52 -- Summary of Saul's family; statement regarding the
wars with Philistines and statement that
<P>
&quot;Whenever Saul saw a mighty or brave man, he took him into
his service&quot; -- a foreshadowing of David's coming.
<P>
Finally, (B') 15:1-34 is an expansion on Saul's rejection first
described in 13:7b-22.
<P>
The addition of David to Saul's staff meshes with the patterns
already established and in 14:52, David's entrance is foreshadowed.
<P>
In response to Saul's rejection, Samuel goes and finds a replacement
in the person of David, 16:1-13. Notice that after having anointed
David, 16:13 states &quot;Samuel then went to Ramah&quot;, paralleling
the condensed version of 15:34 &quot;Then Samuel left for Ramah&quot;,
and 13:15 &quot;Then Samuel left Gilgal and went up to Gibeah
of Benjamin&quot; (LXX has &quot;went his way&quot;). Look at
the structure:
<P>
A 16:14-17 -- Saul's emotional problems and search for musician
<P>
B 16:18 -- David, described as a warrior
<P>
C 16:19 -- request to David's father
<P>
D 16:20-23 -- David enters Saul's service as an armor bearer
<P>
B'-C' 17:1-54 Philistine war and Goliath David's involvement
<P>
D' 17:55-18:2 -- Introduction after success; David' enters Saul's
service.
<P>
Both narratives (16:14-23 and 17:1-18:2) end at the same point,
with David entering Saul's service. The difference is that 16:14-23
is a <I>summary</I> account, while 17:1-18:2 is an<I> expanded</I>
account of the same time frame, but with the emphasis somewhat
different, as the former (16:14-23) narrative ends on Saul's emotional
problems resulting from his rejection by God, and the latter (17:1-18:2)
on military problems associated with the Philistines. In both
cases, David is involved, but the Hebrew approach to relating
the story separates thematic elements and concentrates on them
one at a time.
<P>
The structure of the whole passage (13-18:2) may be visualized
as follows:
<P>
A 13:3-7a
<P>
B 13:7b-22
<P>
A' 13:23-14:14
<P>

<P>
<B>V. Conclusion and Summary</B> 
<P>
The supposed difficulties in the Flood narrative or the Tower
of Babel narrative harmonize and fall into place once the overriding
importance of theme is recognized. Difficulties in the order of
events between the gospels (especially between John and the Synoptics),
and many of the special difficulties of Matthew's gospel can be
handled in the same way, especially if one recognizes that Luke,
being Greek, had reason to write at the beginning of his Gospel,
contrasting himself with the other narratives, that it &quot;seemed
good also to me to write an orderly account...&quot; (Luke 1:3).
That is, Luke chose to write an account where chronology was the
most important structuring principle -- in the Greek style in
contrast to the Hebrew style.
<P>
 So, once freed from insisting on a Greek narrative technique
in which chronology and time are principle elements of arranging
a narrative, the texts of Scripture are once again fully comprehensible,
although they contribute to a certain discombobulation and culture
shock.
<P>
<B>Saul's Recourse to Occultism</B>
<P>
 The final step in the king's downfall was his recourse to the
so-called &quot;witch&quot; (necromancer) of Endor (1 Samuel 28:3-25).
 The seriousness of this, the king's final plunge into ruin, is
made clear in the fact that he was resorting to an illegitimate
means of ascertaining the future, which  many view as characteristic
of the polytheistic nations surrounding Israel (though there is
some doubt about that, as we shall see), and certainly utterly
at variance with Yahwehism.  As such, occult traffic in Israel
was under the most severe interdict and punishable by death (Lev.
19:31; 20:6, 27; Deut. 18:10, 11).  The fact that Saul himself
had outlawed occult practices and that he dared to have recourse
to them himself when he was cut off from communication with God
(1 Samuel 28:6) clearly indicates his own desperation.
<P>
 Deciphering and interpretation of the Hittite texts discovered
by Hugo Winckler in excavations begun in 1906 at Boghazkeui, the
site of the old Hittite capital situated in the great bend of
the Halys River, ninety miles east of Ankara, has shed light on
this interesting Biblical episode.  It is now known from these
cuneiform t exts that in ancient Asia Minor of the second millennium
BC (and later) magical ritual and occult practices were the special
province of old women.  A number of magical rituals are said to
have been recorded from the utterance of these sibyls or seers.
 Several centuries later old women also appear among the Assyrians
as insturments of oracles.  Among the Canaanites of Ugarit in
North Syria in the 14th c. BC, the word which is translated &quot;familiar
spirit&quot; evidently had the meaning of &quot;spirit of the
dead.&quot;  
<P>
 Occult practices, with widespread belief in demons or evil spirits,
and the manifestation of various demonological phenomena such
as divination, magic and necromancy (consulting the supposed spirits
of the departed dead) were characteristic of the environment of
ancient Israel and offered the perpetual peril of contamination
to the faithful follower of Yahweh.
<P>
 The Old Testament &quot;witch&quot; (Exodus 22:18; Deut. 18:10),
correctly rendered in the NIV as &quot;sorceress&quot;, is a term
used to describe women who trafficked in occult practices in general.
 The so-called &quot;witch&quot; or &quot;medium&quot;, is described
as &quot;one who has a familiar spirit (Heb. <I>'ov</I>)&quot;,
that is &quot;One in whom there was (0r was thought to be) a divining
demon&quot; (cf. Lev. 19:31; 20:6; and 20:27).  The woman whom
Saul consulted is said to have been &quot;a woman who was mistress
of a divining demon&quot; (1 Sam. 28:7), that is, an ancient necromancer
(same as the modern &quot;spiritualist&quot;) who professed to
give clandestine information from the spirits of the departed
dead.
<P>
 According to the narrative, Saul's doom is announced by Samuel
by means of a post-mortem appearance of the venerable prophet
in spirit form (1 Sam. 28:11-25).  The monarch's resort to a source
of information that was by evil power and the antithesis of being
directed  by Yahweh was as complete a denial as was possible of
the essential meaning of what Hebrew King was intended to be as
a representative of divine will.  Saul, accordingly, merited his
destruction on the battlefield of Gilboa (concerning Astrology,
see Isaiah 47:12-15).
<P>
 Where was Endor, the place where Saul's witch was from?  According
to Joshua 17:11 it was a city in Manassah; probably it is to be
identified with the modern Endor, located on the north side of
Little Hermon (Nebi Dahi), about four miles from Mt. Tabor.  The
name Endor is from two Hebrew words, <I>ein</I>, meaning spring
and <I>dor</I> meaning generation or age; hense, a translation
of the name would be something like Generation Spring.
<P>
 The &quot;witch&quot; or necromancer was common throughout Israel
and the Ancient Near East in general.  In any polytheistic society,
the gods, by virtue of multiplicity and limitations of power,
are incapable of securing for themselves, for nature, and for
humanity the stability and security essential for the continuation
of things as they are.  This deficiency forced both gods and human
beings to make use of magic -- an inactive power independent of
gods and human beings, but which could be activated by the use
of incantations and rituals in order to accomplish supernatural
deeds.
<P>
 It is nevertheless intersting to find a negative view of necromancy
even among the Babylonians.  The second law in the Code of Hammurappi
is the following:
<P>
 If a man has brought a charge of socery against another man,
but has not proved it, the one against whom the carge of sorcery
was brought, upon going to the river, shall throw himself into
the river, and if the river has then overpowered him, his accuser
shall take his estate; if the river has shown that man to be innocent
and he has accordingly come forth safe, the one who brought the
charge of sorcery against him shall be put to death, while the
one who threw himself in to the river shall take over the  estate
of his accuser.
<P>
<B>The Reign of David</B>
<P>
 Later Hebrew history looked back upon David as the ideal king,
and regarded his reign, and that of his son Slomon, as the golden
age of the Hebrew kingdom.  In the esteem of the nation David
was accorded a place only second to Moses himself.  Whereas Moses
had led the tribes out of bondage and merged them into a nation
at Sinai, giving them a common faith and laying down for them
their civil and ecclesiastical law, David was the real founder
of the Hebrew Monarchy.  It was he who &quot;carried into effect
the whole system, civil and ecclesiastical, which had been foreshadowed
at Sinai.&quot;
<P>
 Moreover, in contrast to Saul, who although noble in his strictly
national aspierations, wa nevertheless rough and repelling, David
possessed a singularly gentle and wisome personality and showed
a remarkable gift for attracting friends. This preeminent element
in his chracter not only eventually won for him the kingship which
was entirely unsought, but assured him the fullest success in
it when once he was chosen to the high office.  It is quite certain
that Jonathan, being heir to the throne after Saul, would not
have been such an ardent friend and supporter of David in everything
had David from the beginning conspired to bring about Saul's downfall
and had possessed selfish plans to assume the royal title.
<P>
 David's magnanimity was remarkably displayed toward Saul upon
numerous occasions.  After he became king of Judah, similar tactics
of patience and moderation in national affairs won for him the
kingship over all Israel and in international affairs enabled
him to carve out a substantial empire to bequeath to his son Solomon.
 This feat of empire building he was able to accomplish largely
without resorting to wars that were waged for conquest.  By simply
fighting in defense of the Israelite nation when it was threatened
by those who refused his overtures of friendship and who were
jealous of his expanding power, he was able to extend his domains
apart from actual military aggression.
<P>
 David's policy as king seems clearly to have been &quot;to be
strong at home, but to live side by side with other nations as
his allies.&quot;  Ties of friendship accordingly were established
with Hiram, king of Tyre (2 Sam. 5:11) and Toi, king of Hamath
(2 Sam. 8:9-10).  David's proposed alliance with the Ammonites,
on the other hand, was contemptuously rejected (2 Sam. 10:1-5).
 This affront not only complelled him to war against Ammon, but
brought him into inevitable clash with the Arameans, whom the
Ammonites hired to fight against Israel (2 Sam. 10:6-19).
<P>
 Likewise the warlike advance of the Philistines, when they heard
that David had been annointed king over Israel, made peaceable
agreement with them impossible and opened up the occasion, as
in the case of his other enemies, for their conquest (2 Sam. 5:17-25).
 Similarly David's attitude toward the Moabites (cf. 1 Sam. 22:3-4)
and the Edomites, to whom he conceded a measure of independence
after he conquered them, suggests the same policy.
<P>
<B>David's early activity as king</B>
<P>
 The death of Saul precipitated a crisis in the political history
of Israel, and a period of civil war followed.  Meanwhile David
had gone up to the city of Hebron situated in the hill country
of Judah some ninetten miles in a southwesterly direction from
Jerusalem.  Well-known in Biblical hisotory since the days of
the patriarchs, Hebron was now to come into special prominence
as a royal city.
<P>
 Not long after David and the men who were with him had taken
up their residence a hebron, he was anointed king over the house
of Judah and reigned seven and one half years over that tribe
(2 Sam. 2:1-11).  In the interim the long civil war between the
house of Saul and the house of David eventuated in the gradual
weakening and the final extermination of the house of Saul, and
David's being anointed king over all Israel (2 Sam. 2:8-5:5).

<P>
<B>  </B>
<P>
<B>Capture of Jerusalem</B>
<P>
 As soon as he was chosen king over all the tribes, David set
himself to the task of establishing the kingdom.  One of his first
and most important accomplishments was his conquest of the Jebusite
stronghold at Jerusalem, which he made his new capital.  Situated
on a plateau of commanding height twenty-five hundred feet above
the Mediterranean and thirty-eight hundred feet above the Dead
Sea, the Jebusite fortress, scarped by natural rock for defense,
with stout walls, gates and towers, was considered impregnable.
 So secure did the native Jebusite defenders consider themselves
that they taunted David and the Israelite beseigers with the words:
&quot;You will not come in here, but the blind and the lame will
ward you off -- thinking David cannot come in here.&quot; (2 Sam.
5:6)
<P>
 Despite the formidable defenses of the place David took the stronghold.
 On the day when the citadel was stormed David said &quot;Whoever
would smite the Jebusites, let him get up the water shaft to attack
the lame and the blind, who are hated by David's soul.&quot; (2
Sam. 5:8).  It is possible that this &quot;get up the water shaft&quot;
should better be rendered &quot;gets up with a hook&quot; and
kills the Jebusites.
<P>
 Albright observes: &quot;The word is now known to be typically
Canaanite and the sense &quot;hook&quot; has been handed down
through Aramaic to modern Arabic.  The hook in question was used
to assist besiegers in scaling ramparts.
<P>
 The common interpretation of this word which might now be translated
&quot;hook&quot; has been that it constitutes a reference to the
ancient water shaft inside the Virgin Fountain at Jerusalem. 
But there is some question about this now.  However, early research
of the Palestine Exploration Fund at Jerusalem, under the direction
of Sir Charles Warren, yielded important knowledge of the Jebusite
water system.  The city was naturally deficient in water supply.
 All water had to be caught in cisterns during the rainy season
or brought in from a distance by aqueducts, since there were no
springs on the hill.  Two springs in the valley supply water.
 One, situated at the foot of the eastern hill in the Kidron Valley
below Ophel, the hump or hill, south of the Temple area, was anciently
called Gihon (1 Kings 1:40-45; 2 Chron. 32:30) and is mentioned
by Josephus.  Today, it is known as Sai Mary's Well or the Virgin's
Fountain.  The other fountain, Enrogel, now called Job's Well,
is located southeast of the city at a point just below the junction
of the valleys of Hinnom and the Kidron (Josh. 15:1, 2 Sam. 17:17).
<P>
 As a result of his excavations Warren discovered that the inhabitants
of Jerusalem about 2000 BC had made a rock-cut passage, similar
to the one at Gezer and at Megido, to enable them to secure water
from the Gihon spring without having to go outside the city walls.
 From the cave into which the Gihon spring entered, a horizontal
tunnel had been driven back into the hill some 36 feet west and
25 feet north.  This conduit brought the water back into an old
cave, which thus served as a reservoir.  Running up from this
was a 40 foot vertical tunnel (now known as Warren's Shaft), at
the top of which was a platform where the women could stand to
lower their buckets and draw up water.  From this a sloping passage
ran up with its entrance within the city walls.
<P>
 Although David's men evidently scaled the walls of Jerusalem
and did not gain entrance to the Jebusite fortress, as had been
thought, by means of the city's underground water system; archeology
has shown that the anciaent citadel which David took called &quot;the
stronghold of Zion&quot; and subsequently the &quot;city of David&quot;
(2 Samuel 5:7), which the king built, were located on the eastern
hill above the Gihon Fountain and not on the so-called western
hill of Zion, separated by the Tyropoean Valley.  This is clear
from excavations and from the fact that the water supply determined
the earliest settlement in Jerusalem.
<P>
 In Old Testament times the eastern hill was considerably higher
and more commanding in appearance than in later times.  The Hasmoneans
of the 2nd  century BC removed the crest of this area that it
might not rival the Temple area in height.  This accentuated the
prominence of the western hill, which was naturally larger and
higher.  As a result, since as early as the beginning of the Christian
era, ancient Jebusite Jerusalem had been popularly but erroneously
associated with the southern portion of the western hill, a tradition
which has been corrected only by more than a century's worth of
archeological research, extending from De Saulcey's first search
for the Tombs of the Kings of David and his successors in 1850
to the discovery of the location and limits of the City of David
in 1927.
<P>
 The actual uncovering of the City of David, although made possible
through the previous labors of such men as sir Charles Warren,
Clermont-Ganneau, Hermann Guthe, Frederick Bliss and Captain Raymond
Weill, was due to the research of John Garstang and his colleagues,
together with his successor, J.W. Crowfoot, which extended over
the years 1922-1927.  As a result of these fruitful researches
the modest limits of the City of David were determined.  Portions
of the Jebusite city wall and fortification were uncovered, including
the great western gate.
<P>
 Evidence brought to light showed that the city which David captured
was shaped like a huge human footprint about 1250 feet long and
400 feet wide and was situated some distance south of the temple
area.  At most its total walled space could not have exceeded
eight acres, comparable to the same area within the walls of Tell
en-Nasbeh, the six acres of Canaanite Jericho and the 30 acres
of contemporary Megiddo.  However, its stout walls and elevated
position made it virtually impregnable to foes.  Nevertheless,
by superhuman courage David's valiant men took it by storm.
<P>
<B>Jerusalem Made the Nation's Capital</B>
<P>
 David's conquest of Jerusalem was an exceedingly important event,
making possible the choice of the city as his capital.   Moreover,
he displayed great wisdom in his selection of the conquered city
as the focal point of his new government.  He realized its strategic
importance and doubtless had it in mind as his new capital before
conquering it.  The city stood on the border of Judah and Israel
and its neutral oocation tended to allay the jealousy between
the northern and southern portions of his kingdom.  Its liberation
from the Canaanites opened the highway between Judah and the North,
expedited commercial and social intercourse, and helped further
to unite the kingdom.
<P>
<B>Subjugation of Neighboring States</B>
<P>
 David's establishment as king over a united Israel provoked the
fear and jealousy of the Philistines, who twice invaded Israelite
territory to attack David and who were twice decisively defeated
near Jerusalem (2 Sam. 5:17-25).  David wisely followed up these
victories by invading Philistia.  The capture of Gath (1 Chron.
18:1) and additional conquests in subsequent brief campaigns (2
Sam. 21:15-22) so completely subjugated the Philistines that the
power of this inveterate enemy of Israel, which had continuously
threatened to overwhelm the young Israelite kingdom since the
days of Saul, was effectively nullified. 
<P>
 In similar fashion to counteract attack, to avenge insult, to
insure the safety of the nation and to keep it from idolatrous
contamination, David waged war with other surrounding nations
including the Moabites, Aramaeans, Ammonites, Edomites and Amalekites
(2 Sam. 8:10; 12:26-31).  By these conquests and by skillful diplomacy,
he was able to build up an empire of sorts for his son Solomon
which extended from Ezion-Geber, on the Gulf of Aqabah in the
south to the region of Hums, on the border of Hamath in the north.
<P>
<B>David's Political and Religious Innovations</B>
<P>
 Although the shepherd king's colorful personality, his skillful
diplomacy and his brilliant military strategy have overshadowed
his administrative ability, this aspect of his talent must not
be overlooked.  His name is possibly derived from the title <I>dawidum</I>,
which meant &quot;leader&quot; in the earlier Mari letters from
Tell el Hariri on the Middle Euphrates.
<P>
 <B>Organization of the kingdom. </B> That his administrative
achievements were extensive in contrast to those of Saul, who
was little more than a rustic chieftain, is clearly reflected
in the strong kingdom he left behind him and in the preservation
of accounts of its effecient organization (cf. 1 Chron. 22:17-27:34).
 David's officialdom, moreover, has been shown to have been organized
in part at least on Egyptian models.  Among Egyptian official
institutions which he copied, doubtless not directly but through
Phoenician or other intermediaries, was the division of functions
between the &quot;recorder&quot; or &quot;chronicler&quot; (<I>mazker</I>)
and the &quot;scribe&quot; or &quot;secretary&quot; (<I>sopher</I>);
see 2 Sam. 8:16-17 -- and the coucil of thirty (cf. 1 Chron. 27:6).
 His army was a well-organized and efficient fighting machine
(2 Sam. 8:16) and included a select personal bodyguard of foreign
mercenaries, evidently Philistine, called Cherethites and Pelethites
(2 Sam. 8:18).
<P>
 <B>Allocation of Levitical Cities.</B>  As another important
element in the political organization of his realm many scholars
ascribe to David the actual allocation of Levitical cities.  Although
these cities, including the cities of refuge (Num. 35), were provided
for by Moses before entrance into the land and appointed by Joshua
after the Conquest (Josh. 20:1, 2; 21:2), it was impossible before
the time of Saul or David for many of these places, such as Gezer,
Ibleam, Taanach, Rehob in Asher, Joknean and Naholal (cf. Josh.
21), to have been actually allotted to the Levites since they
were not Israelite at all before that time.
<P>
 Other towns such as Eltekeh and Gibbethon were under Philistine
control until the time of David, and such small hamlets as Anathoth
and Alemoth in the tribe of Benjamin can scarcely have become
Levitic towns before the removal of the tabernacle to Nob in the
time of Saul.  It is more likely that they were allotted to the
Levites after David took Jerusalem and made it the capital of
Israel, since there is no doubt that he planned some kind of administrative
reorganization of the Israelite confederation.
<P>
 <B>Allocation of Cities of Refuge.</B>  It is quite certain that
the six cities of refuge, as well as the 48 Levitical cities,
figured prominently in David's reorganization of his realm. In
his time there was a very real need for an institution that would
provide asylum to which one unjustly accused of a crime might
flee, as Loehr has pointed out.  The idea, common throughout the
ancient Mediterranean world, would contribute to the stability
of the Monarchy and would not be overlooked by a wise administrator
like David.
<P>
 During the period of the judges, private, clan and tribal vendettas
flourished, and were commonly very destructive, as is illustrated
by Ephraim's jealousy of Gideon's victories over the Amalekites
(Judges 8:1-4), Jephthah's successes over the Ammonites, and the
bitter civil war between the various tribes and Benjamin over
the murder of the Levite's concubine (Judges 19:1-21:25).  As
a wise statesman, David was fully aware that a stable monarchy
could not tolerate blood feuds, and he was quick to see the advantage
of employing the Mosaic provision of six Levitic towns, three
on each side of the Jordan, for the purpose of helping to consolodate
his kingdom and of contributing to its tranquility.
<P>
 <B>Removal of the Ark to Jerusalem.</B>  As soon as he had  established
his kingdom, as a loyal worshiper of Yahweh, David turned his
attention to the mora and spiritual needs of his people and sought
to make his new capital at Jerusalem the religious as well as
the political center of his expanding empire.
<P>
 His most important single act in this direction was the removal
of the ark to Jerusalem from Kiriath-Jearim, where Israel's sacred
chest had remained, except for a very breif period at Beth-shemesh,
after the Philistines, in whose territory it had been kept since
its capture at the battle of Ebenezer (c. 1050 BC), had restored
it to Israel.
<P>
 But David's first attempt to bring the ark to Jerusalem proved
abortive, owing to his unwitting, though serious, neglect to follow
the divine instructions concerning the transportation of the sacred
object (2 Sam. 6:1-15; 1 Chron. 15:13).  Instead of first having
the chest covered by the priests and then borne by the Levites
by means of its staves in accordance with prescribed Mosaic regulations
(Num. 4:5, 15, 19), his resort to the Philistine expedient of
a new cart drawn by oxen (cf. 1 Sam. 6:7,  8) led to the death
of Uzzah, who put his hand out to steady the ark and thus committed
a sacrilege for which the law stipulated death (Num. 4:15).
<P>
 As a result of this mishap, the ark remained at Perez-Uzzah for
three months, after which David with great religious celebration
brought it up the City of David (2 Sam. 6:12-15).  During th elaborate
ceremonies of music, pagentry and sacrifices, David is said to
have &quot;danced before the Lord with all his might ... girded
with a linen ephod &quot; (2 Sam. 6:14) -- this ephod was a kind
of linen apron, suspended from the shoulders, and usually very
ornate.  What David and the priests wore was something very different
from the ephod of Gideon, apparently, which weighed in at 17,000
shekels (nearly 425 pounds!); see Josh. 18:10, 1 Sam. 3:3, and
4:10-11.
<P>
 A structure, doubtless copied after the specifications of the
Mosaic prototype, had existed at Nob to which the priests apparently
fled (1 Sam. 21:1, 9) after the ark had been taken by the Philistines.
 But without the ark the tabernacle had lost its value and glory
(Psalm 78:60) until David constructed a new tent to house the
sacred symbol of God's covenant presense with His people.
<P>
 Modern criticism shows a tendency to deny the historicity of
the original tabernacle described in the Pentateuch and the book
of Joshua and to make it essentially a reflection of the later
allegedly more ornate and complex Davidic tent or a concoction
of exilic and post-exilic priestly writers. Modern criticism supposes
that the elaborate construction and appurtenance  of the Mosaic
institution were unsuitable to the life of migrants.  However,
archaeology has shown that the description of the constru;ction
of the tabernacle offers nothing which would have been difficult
for the craftsmen of the Mosaic era to make, and technical terms
employed of the tabernacle and its parts have recently been found
in records dating from the 14th to the 11th centuries BC.  The
tent which David pitched for the ark accordingly may be safely
taken as a faithful replica of the Mosaic tent and not as largely
a Davidic innovation.
<P>
 Moreover, from ancient Arabic tradition and modern Bedouin practice
it is well-known that it was customary for nomadic desert tribes
to carry their sacred tent-shrines with them much in the manner
of Israel in the wilderness.  From fragments of the Phoenician
history of Sanchuniathon (c. 650 BC) there is a reference to a
portable shrine of much earlier date, which was drawn by oxen.
 Diodorus, the Greek historian of the first century AD, tells
of a sacred tent pitched in the center of a Carthaginian battle
camp with an altar nearby.
<P>
 Of particular significance in the archeology of the tabernacle
is the ancient miniature red leather tent with domed top called
the <I>qubbah</I>.  In the pre-Islamic period some of these tents
were suitable for mounting on camel back.  Others were larger.
 The tent frequently contained the local idols (betyls) and was
deemed capable of guiding the tribe in its wanderings, and by
firtue of its presence on the battlefield, was regarded as efficacious
to protect from the enemy and give victory.  Accordingly, it was
commonly set up near the chieftain's tent.  As an object of peculiar
sacredness, the <I>qubbah</I> afforded general protection.  It
was also a place of worship, where priests gave oracles.
<P>
 Since black tents were characteristic from most ancient times,
the red leather of which they were made is most extraordinary,
especially since the color tended to expose the camp and the station
of the chieftain.  This strange custom implies a deep-rooted conservative
religious practice, and is illustrated by a number of representations
of the <I>qubbah</I> from Syria and a specific reference to the
institution in an Aramaic inscription. The temple of Bel in Palmyra,
which dates from the third to the first century BC, interestingly,
portrays the <I>qubbah</I> in a bas-relief, with tremnants of
paint still clinging to it.
<P>
 The <I>qubbah</I> is mentioned in Numbers 25:8 in connection
with Phinehas who &quot;went into the tent &quot; (<I>qubbah</I>)
and killed the &quot;man of Israel&quot; and the Midianite woman
he had married.  The passage is usually construed as a reference
to the tabernacle or to the sacred enclosure.
<P>
 These Semitic parallels lend striking confirmation to the fact
that the Mosaic tabernacle had a &quot;covering...of rams; skins
dyed red&quot; (Exo. 26:14; 36:19) and the institution of the
<I>qubbah</I> among ancient Semies doubltless sheds light on the
origin of the tabernacle.  The portable red leather tent appears
to be one of the oldest motifs in Semitic religion and furnishes
additional evidence that the Israelite tabernacle and ark have
historical connections with the Semitic past.  Parallels must
not be unduly pressed, as some scholars have done, but the fact
must nevertheless be kept in mind that Israel's religious customs
were rooted in general Semitic practices, which, hhowever, under
divine revelation through Moses, were transformed to suit the
purposes of the worship of Yahweh.
<P>
 As the ancient Semitic tent-shrine was radically reinterpreted
by Mohammed at a much later date, so doubtless it had been transformed
at a much earlier time under Moses to fit the mould of Israelite
monotheism.  Moreover, David's tent went back to the Mosaic pattern,
although it doubtless elaborated on some features, as was certainly
the case in the Solomonic temple.
<P>
<B>Organization of Sacred Music.</B>  There has been a marked
tendency on the part of modern criticism to deny or to drastically
minimize David's activity in organizing Hebrew sacred music. 
The common theory is that the formal establishment of classes
of temple musicians is strictly post-exilic.  Their alleged founding
in the early monarchic period (1 Chron. 1:4-6, 37-43) is assumed
to be aetiological or purposive, the Chronicler (about 400 BC)
attributing to David (around 990 BC) the organization of the temple
musical guilds because he was anxious to magnify the role of the
singers' and doorkeepers' guilds which were striving for a higher
rank (1 Chron. 23-25). 
<P>
 Until recent times this fallacious position was not easy to refute
because of a lack of external evidence.  Now, however, archeology
has illuminated the subject to such an extent as to show that
there is nothing incongruous in the light of conditions existing
in the ancient Near Eastern world around 1000 BC, in the Biblical
representation of David as the patron saint of Jewish hymnology
and &quot;the organizer of the Temple music.&quot;
<P>
 Egyptian and Mesopotamian sources give ample evicence that Palestine
and Syria were well-known in antiquity for their musicians.  The
knowledge of music and musical instruments among the early Hebrews
and their prediluvian ancestors in extremely early times is reflected
in the account of Jabal, Jubal and Tubal-Cain (Gen. 4:20-22).
 In the early nineteenth century BC Semitic craftsmen carried
musical instruments with them when they went down into Egypt,
as is depicted on the famous relief from Beni-Hasan, 169 miles
above Cairo.
<P>
 From the epic religious literature discovered at Ras Shamra,
ancient Ugarit in north Syria, it is now known that the &quot;singers&quot;
(<I>sharim</I>) formed a special class of temple personnel there
as early as 1400 BC.  The records of the New Empire in Egypt (c.
1546-1085), the period of the heyday of Pharaonic splendor, contain
a number of references to Canaanite music and many representations
of Canaanite musicians and instruments.  King Hezekiah of Judah
in the 8th c. BC sent Sennacherib of Assyria male and female musicians,
who are listed as part of a valuable tribute, indicating that
these performers had considerable reputation for talent.  Moreover,
the Greeks are known to have borrowed several musical instruments
along with their names from the musically talented Phoenicains.
 external evidence thus offers every reason to suppose that the
institution of temple muscians goes back to an early date.
<P>
 The Scriptural narratives themselves, on the other hand, offer
strong evidence attesting David's musical interests and abilities.
 Coupled with his pious devotion to Yahweh, David's interest in
music presents an ideal background for the Chronicler's assertion
that he organized the guilds of temple musicians.  David is repeatedly
represented as a skillful performer on the lyre (1 Sam. 16;14-23)
and a composer of beautiful poetry (2 Sam. 1:17-27).  he is said
to have danced before the ark (2 Sam. 6:5 and 14). A large number
of Psalms are attributed to him by a persistent tradition reflected
in the superscriptions.
<P>
 However, there are not only strong indications of the existence
of temple music early in Israel, but there is incontrovertible
archaelogical evidence for the antiquity of the musical guilds
themselves.  The Phoenicians (Canaanites) outshone their contemporaries
in music, and the Israelites were early influenced by them.  Musical
guilds of the Hebrews may be traced back in some instances, to
told Canaanite families whose designations, such as Heman the
Ezrahite (1 Chron. 2:6), became a part of later Hebrew family
names.
<P>
 In addition, such terms as &quot;Asaph&quot;, &quot;Heman&quot;
and &quot;Ethan&quot; or &quot;Jeuthun&quot; are evidently used
by the Chronicler to designate musical guilds, and in the case
of &quot;Heman&quot; and &quot;Ethan&quot; are closely paralleled
by scores of abbreviated names found at Ugarit and elsewhere,
and are characteristically Canaanite and early, not appearing
in later Hebrew lists of contemporary names.
<P>
 Other names occuring in connection with the musical guilds are
Chalcol and Darda (1 Chron. 2:6), which with Ethan and Heman appear
in the lists of wise men in 1 Kings 4:31.  This classification
is quite appropriate, since a great musician was commonly also
a seer (1 Chron. 25:5) or a prophet (1 Chron. 25:2,3), as well
as a wise man.  Chalocol and Darda are designated &quot;sons of
Mahol&quot; or &quot;members of the orchestral guild&quot;, and
seem to reflect a class of plant or flower names applied to musicians.
 The equivalent of &quot;Chalcol&quot; significantly appears on
several ivoires found at Megiddo in the hieroglyphic form <I>kulkul</I>,
as a singer attached to the temple of Ptah in the Canaanite city
of Ashkelon, dated about the 13th century BC.
<P>
 Hebrew temple music was accordingly recognized in Israel as going
back to early pre-Israelite sources, and, although archelogical
evidence does not prove that David organized the first religious
music in Israel, it does show that the Chronicler's attribution
of such activity to Israel's shepherd king contains nothing inconsistent
with the spirit of the times or at variance with the contemporary
historical scene.
<P>
 Moreover, with regard to the Davidic authorship of the psalms,
a similar conclusion may be reached.  Although archeological evidence
does not prove that any of the psalms go back to David, it does
demonstrate that it is not only possible, but highly probable
that many of them are as early as David or even earlier.  Abundant
light shed on the Hebrew Psalter by the religious literature from
Ugarit shows that many of the Psalms, such as 18, 29, 45, 68,
88 and 89 are saturated with Canaanite stylistic and literary
parallels and even with dierrect quotations.  Just as the Israelites
borrowed their music from their precursors, so they borrowed the
metric form, vocabulary and style of their sacred lyrics from
their Canaanite predecessors.  Consider how this should affect
one's views on music today, along with other things which are
sometimes criticized for &quot;being worldly.&quot;
<P>
 Although the Canaanite material in many of the Psalms does not
necessarily prove an early date, since strong Canaanite coloring
can be shown to have taken place in two distinct periods -- the
11th-10th centuries or in the 6th-4th centuries BC -- yet the
Canaanite context of such a Psalm as 68 and its striking parallels
with such an obviously ancient poem as the Song of Deborah (Judges
5), which cannot be dated under any circumstances later than the
early 11th century, show that this Psalm (and certainly many others)
may well go back to David's time or earlier.  In fact, archeological
evidence points to the high probability that the entire Psalter
spans the whole of OT history from Moses to Zechariah, as its
internal evidence would lead us to conclude, and supports the
traditional role of David as a musician, poet and the organizer
of sacred music in Israel.
