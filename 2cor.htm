Murray J. Harris (<I>The Expositor's Bible Commentary</I>, Vol.
10, Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1976, p. 307) has proposed the following
chronology for the events surrounding the writing of 1 and 2 Corinthians,
during Paul's time in Ephesus (Acts 19-20):
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Spring AD 55 1 Corinthians written
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Summer/Fall AD 55 Painful visit (2 Cor. 2:1, 12:14, 21, 13:1-2)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Spring 56 Severe letter (2 Cor. 7:8, 12)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Spring 56 Paul leaves Ephesus
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Summer 56 Paul in Macedonia
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Summer 56 Titus arrives in Macedonia
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Fall 56 2 Corinthians written
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
His proposal, therefore, is that 2 Corinthians was written from
Macedonia. This is suggested by references in 2 Corinthians 7:5,
8:1, 9:2-4.
