This short booklet defines itself as an “oracle”.  Strictly speaking, <FONT FACE="SPTiberian">a)#&m</FONT> is a “lifting up” or “burden”.  When one speaks for God one lifts a burden and bears it to those who need to receive it.  This is precisely the significance of this word and this is an excellent short definition of the prophetic office. <P>

The second temple Judean community is here labeled “Israel”.  Of course “Israel” no longer exists- but the community is here reclaiming the religious patrimony that has been lost and reclaiming the land as its rightful heritage.  The term is highly “loaded” both religiously and politically; that is why it is adopted.<P>

“By the hand of” Malachi is a description of prophetic intermediation.  Malachi here claims to speak for God and not himself.   Some scholars take <FONT FACE="SPTiberian">yk)lm</FONT> not as a proper name but as a simple noun = “my messenger”.  This may perhaps be correct -- but the message is sent through someone, and there is no reason to think it was not a person named Malachi. <P>

That Yahweh should announce his love for Israel is not all that unusual.  What is unusual is that once this declaration of love is made, Israel speaks up and questions whether it is true or not!  Israel asks “how do you love us”?  This means that what we have here, form critically speaking, is a disputation.  Israel and Yahweh are disputing whether or not God really loves them.  <P>

In verse 2 the weak verb <FONT FACE="SPTiberian">hbh)</FONT> retains its full syllabic value.  <P>

The vocabulary is that found in covenant documents.  “Love” means “chosen” and “hate” means “not chosen”.  If one were to compare the use of <FONT FACE="SPTiberian">bh)</FONT> in Deuteronomy with its usage here in Malachi one would see that Malachi is not saying that God hates Esau.  Malachi is saying that God did not choose Esau to be the chosen people; but he did choose Israel.  Our english words “love” and “hate” are simply inaccurate as translations of this text (v.3).<P>

How does God love us?  The answer is “he loves us because the covenant remains in force; we are still the chosen people even though we have horribly rebelled against God and suffered the consequences in exile.  He has not cast us aside but now gives us another chance to prove our love for Him.  In fact, Dt 2:4-5 clearly shows that Yahweh loves Esau as well as Israel (in our use of the word; still Esau is not chosen).  Futher, cf. Dt. 21:15.  
In verse 4 we have what form critics call a “futility curse”.  Those who oppose the chosen people, whoever they may be, will find that their act is fully futile.  No one can oppose God’s plan.  <P>

Finally, the phrase “thus says Yahweh of hosts” occurs 20 times in this short booklet.  This is a key to rightly interpreting the book because the hearer is constanere.  <P>
