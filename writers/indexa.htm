<h2>The 2nd Annual Antelope Valley
Christian Writers Conference</h2><p>

Sponsored by<p>
	
<h3>High Desert Christian Writers
And
Quartz Hill School of Theology</h3><p>

<h4>>May 5-6, 2007</h4></center><p>


Our first annual Antelope Valley Christian Writers Conference, this past May, was a success.  It was quite encouraging to see our prayers answered, with dozens of attendees and several experienced faculty present.<p>
 
Our next conference promises to be even better.  Anyone interested in writing for the Christian publishing market is welcome to attend.  <p>
  
The conference will be held at Christ our Savior Methodist Church in Quartz Hill, a small unincorporated area on the Westside of the Valley.  Complimentary refreshments and a continental breakfast will be provided.  Several budget-priced hotels are in the local area for your convenience. <p> 



<center><b>About the Antelope Valley</b></center><p>

For those unfamiliar with the area, the Antelope Valley is a desert community at the northeastern edge of Los Angeles County.  Its two main cities, Lancaster and Palmdale, are among the fastest growing cities in the state of California.  Wildflowers abound every spring, with California Poppies (the official state flower) appearing on just about every hillside.  <p>

The area has a rich heritage with the aerospace industry.  Several major manufacturers have facilities here, and the space shuttles were assembled here.  Edwards Air Force Base is nearby, the site of Chuck Yeager’s historic flight where he broke the sound barrier in a Bell X-1, in 1947.  The Tom Hanks movie, The Terminal, was produced here at Palmdale Regional Airport.<p>




<center><b>Faculty</b></center><p>

For this year’s conference, we have assembled a distinguished faculty of award-winning writers.  Each of them has decades of experience in the field, and they reserve a special place in their hearts for helping new writers.  <p>


Our keynote speaker, Lauraine Snelling, has written over 30 books (both fiction and non fiction) for adults and young adults. Lauraine is also the author of the popular RED RIVER OF THE NORTH series set in North Dakota in the 19th century. Besides writing books and articles, she teaches at writer’s conferences across the country and has an active speaking career. <p>

She and husband Wayne have two grown sons, and live in Southern California.  Lauraine can garden, sew, do crafts, cross stitch, enjoy her birds and eventually have a horse again.<p>


Tim Riter has published nine books and written articles for the Los Angeles Times, Christianity Today, Discipleship Journal, and Moody Magazine.  His latest book is Not a Safe God, from Broadman and Holman, 2006.  After serving decades as a pastor, Tim now writes and teaches full time. He teaches writing at Hope International University and Linfield Christian School, communication at Azusa Pacific University, and a major track on Ministry and Writing at the Mount Hermon Christian Writers Conference.  <p>

He and his wife Sheila (also an author) live in Temecula and enjoy cruising in their Mustang convertible with their grandkids Josh and Hannah. Tim is also an inveterate stream fisherman for trout.<p>
    
  
Cindy Kenney’s love for children, writing, and the Lord have culminated in a wonderful career as a writer, editor, speaker, and consultant to many. She worked in the field of Christian education before she began writing stories and curriculum for children of all ages.<p>

Today, Cindy is the Director of Publishing for Exclaim Entertainment, creators of Boz the Big Green Bear.  She continues to write and edit stories and curriculum that engage, intrigue, and connect children to the Lord. Formerly an editor for the Veggie Tales animated series, Cindy now speaks around the United States and Canada to deliver creative inspiration; teach writers, children, and Christian educators.<p>
      
Cindy has been married for 20 years to her husband Jim, and is the proud mother of two sons.  She feels blessed with each new day and looks forward to whatever creativity it may bring!<p>
