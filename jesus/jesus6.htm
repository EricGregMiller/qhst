<blockquote><B>Then he looked up at his disciples and said:</B>
<br>
<B>&quot;Blessed are you who are poor,</B>
<br>
<B>for yours is the kingdom of God.</B>
<br>
<B>&quot;Blessed are you who are hungry now,</B>
<br>
<B>for you will be filled.</B>
<br>
<B>&quot;Blessed are you who weep now,</B>
<br>
<B>for you will laugh.</B></blockquote>
<P>
<B>&quot;Blessed are you when people hate you, and when they exclude
you, revile you, and defame you on account of the Son of Man.
 lainRejoice in that day and leap for joy, for surely your reward
is great in heaven; for that is what their ancestors did to the
prophets. </B>
<P>
 In contrast to the much fuller and more ecclesiastical version
of the &quot;Beatitudes&quot; found in Matthew, Q has a much briefer
form.  In this Q version the blessed one is not one who is poor
in the spiritual realm or in spiritual things; here poverty is
the more tangible and widespread genuine destitution of the average
Galilean peasant.  So, in essence, what Jesus here teaches is
that there will be a great &quot;reversal of fortune&quot;.  All
who are poor now will one day be rich because they will participate
in the Kingdom of God.  This raises a very important issue in
historical Jesus research; is the Kingdom a present reality or
a future reality to Jesus?  That is, is the kingdom present, or
is it an eschatological kingdom to come at some distant time in
the future?
<P>
 The results of my research would indicate that, for the historical
Jesus, the kingdom of God is a present reality.  The rule of God
is happening now and one need not wait for some future eschatological
event when it will come.  Of course there are scholars who suggest
that the kingdom is a future reality which will be brought in
at the end of time.  This approach, I think, is to misread Jesus.
<P>
 To be sure, many in the early Church, after the death of Jesus,
pushed the kingdom into the future by making it a spiritual realm.
 But so far as I can tell, for Jesus himself, the kingdom was
at hand;  and anything at hand cannot be 2000 years off in the
distance!
<P>
 In any event, Jesus taught that destitution was not the worst
thing that could happen to a person.  The worst thing that could
happen was to be uninvolved in the kingdom of God!  So he pronounces
blessed all those who, though poor in things were rich in grace.
 In this way Jesus was able to supplant the materialism of his
day and of his people.
<P>

<B>“But I say to you that listen, Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless
those who curse you, pray for those who abuse you.  If anyone
strikes you on the cheek, offer the other also; and from anyone
who takes away your coat do not withhold even your shirt.  Give
to everyone who begs from you; and if anyone takes away your goods,
do not ask for them again.   Do to others as you would have them
do to you.  &quot;If you love those who love you, what credit
is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them.  If
you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that to
you? For even sinners do the same.  If you lend to those from
whom you hope to receive, what credit is that to you? Even sinners
lend to sinners, to receive as much again.   But love your enemies,
do good, and lend, expecting nothing in return. Your reward will
be great, and you will be children of the Most High; for he is
kind to the ungrateful and the wicked.  Be merciful, just as your
Father is merciful.  </B>
<P>
 This segment of Q describes the complete rule of love in the
hearts of those who would adhere to Jesus and participate in the
kingdom of God.  Love must, for such people, be the guiding principle
and force of their everyday lives.  They must not give in to rudeness,
cruelty, indifference, harshness or hatred.  Even when attacked
and belittled for their kingdom views they must not retaliate.
 They must live on a higher plain than the run of the mill Palestinian
peasant.  They must put to shame the materialism of their Roman
overlords.  They must, above all else, not give place to the meanness
of society.  If this is done, then they can truly know that the kingdom of God is alive and well in them; and that they are a part of it.<P>
 The ethic of love taught by Jesus was quite revolutionary in
his day.  Though there are Rabbinic parallels to many of the sayings
of Jesus, his overarching ethic of love for the downtrodden is
without peer in any ancient document.  Perhaps in this ethic of
love we are at our very closest to the mind and will of the Historical
Jesus of Nazareth.  Here it is that we see him as he was; for
the Church could not and would not have invented such unlikely
sayings which would stand in constant tension with the real situation
of a status seeking institution.
