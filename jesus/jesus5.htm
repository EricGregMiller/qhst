<B>Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and
was led by the Spirit in the wilderness,  where for forty days
he was tempted by the devil. He ate nothing at all during those
days, and when they were over, he was famished.  The devil said
to him, &quot;If you are the Son of God, command this stone to
become a loaf of bread.&quot; Jesus answered him, &quot;It is
written, 'One does not live by bread alone.' &quot;  Then the
devil led him up and showed him in an instant all the kingdoms
of the world.  And the devil said to him, &quot;To you I will
give their glory and all this authority; for it has been given
over to me, and I give it to anyone I please.  If you, then, will
worship me, it will all be yours.&quot;  Jesus answered him, &quot;It
is written,</B>
<P>
<blockquote><B>'Worship the Lord your God,</B>
<br>
<B>and serve only him.' &quot;</B></blockquote>
<P>
<B> Then the devil  took him to Jerusalem, and placed him on the
pinnacle of the temple, saying to him, &quot;If you are the Son
of God, throw yourself down from here, for it is written, 'He
will command his angels concerning you, to protect you, and 'On
their hands they will bear you up, so that you will not dash your
foot against a stone.' &quot;Jesus answered him, &quot;It is said,
'Do not put the Lord your God to the test.' &quot; When the devil
had finished every test, he departed from him until an opportune
time. </B>
<P>
 Though the reality of a personal &quot;devil&quot; is dismissed
by many moderns, it cannot be doubted that Jesus and his disciples,
as well as most of the Christians in the history of the Church,
strongly believed in the reality of this evil <I>persona</I>.
<P>
 The temptations to which Jesus is subjected are all made in an
effort to dissuade him from following the path which God had chosen
for him.  They are all, if you will, &quot;shorcuts to glory&quot;.
 But instead of submitting to these temptations Jesus simply renounces
all such efforts to evade the will of God.  
<P>
 For Jesus, there is simply nothing more important than doing
the will of God.  Since his baptism this buring devotion was the
driving force of his personality and quite simply explains every
action he undertakes.
