<b>Introduction.</b>
<P>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Quest for the Historical Jesus began many years ago.  Albert
Schweitzer wrote the difinitive study of the Quest.  This study
is still worth reading even today.  But when Strauss wrote his
infamous &quot;Life of Jesus Critically Examined&quot; he brought
the Quest to a screeching halt.  It reamained a non issue for
theologians for about a century until Ernst Kasemann began what
was called the &quot;Second Quest&quot; in the middle of the 20th
century.  That quest, too, was short lived.  Now we are in the
midst of a renewed emphasis on the historical Jesus and this quest
is known as the &quot;Third Quest&quot;.  Participants in this
enquiry are often called &quot;Questers&quot; by those in the
know.
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The presupposition of all three of these &quot;quests&quot; is
that the Gospels are not historical accounts of the life of Jesus
of Nazareth.  Rather, they are theological treatises or sermons.
 The life of Jesus, then, must be rediscovered by examining critically
the Gospels for the historical nuggets buried under the theological layers.  That is a separate study as well.
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As the student is aware, there are some questers who see Jesus
as a cynic philosopher and others who see him as an apocalyptic
prophet.  In the pages which follow neither of these courses will
be taken.  Rather, Jesus is seen here as a citizen of both the
Greek and the Jewish worlds.  He is both wise man and prophet.
 He is revolutionary and conservative.  In short, he simply refuses
to be categorized in either camp!

<b>The Historical Jesus</b>
<P>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In what follows our procedure will be simple; we will examine
those events and words from the life of the Historical Jesus which
can be historically verified.  What cannot be proven historically
will not be considered.  This, clearly, does not mean that the
things not discussed did not happen; rather it means that they
are beyond the ability of historical reconstruction to verify.
 For instance, we will not consider the birth, or resurrection
of Jesus.  Though these events happened, so far as I am concerned,
in essentially the way the Biblical record states, still they
cannot be proven and therefore will not be discussed.  The student
should not be mislead into thinking that I do not believe these
events.  Instead, the student should realize that ultimate matters
are, for good reason, beyond the grasp of historical research.
 We are saved by faith, after all, and not by historical proof.
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So what can we know of the Historical Jesus?  What did he do
and what did he say?   The <B>Bold face</B> print which follows
are, so far as I can ascertain, all historical events and words
drawn from the Synoptic Gospels.  Interspersed, in commentary
fashion, between these events are remarks on their historical
significance by me.  The text is the New Resvised Standard Version
of the Bible.  The textual references are not given as they often
only interrupt the flow of the text and here they would serve
no purpose at all.
