<B>Which one of you, having a hundred sheep and losing one of
them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness and go
after the one that is lost until he finds it?  When he has found
it, he lays it on his shoulders and rejoices.   And when he comes
home, he calls together his friends and neighbors, saying to them,
'Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep that was lost.'  
Just so, I tell you, there will be more joy in heaven over one
sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who
need no repentance.  &quot;Or what woman having ten silver coins,
if she loses one of them, does not light a lamp, sweep the house,
and search carefully until she finds it?   When she has found
it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, 'Rejoice
with me, for I have found the coin that I had lost.'   Just so,
I tell you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God
over one sinner who repents.&quot; </B>
<P>
 Discipleship means compassion on those who are lost and who need
to be found by the participants in the kingdom.  Further, the
disciple must seek out those who are lost in order to bring them
into the fold.  Once these wayward sheep are found the fact that
they are found means joy to the faithful servant of God.
<P>
<B>No slave can serve two masters; for a slave will either hate
the one and love the other, or be devoted to the one and despise
the other. You cannot serve God and wealth.&quot;   &quot;The
law and the prophets were in effect until John came; since then
the good news of the kingdom of God is proclaimed, and everyone
tries to enter it by force.   But it is easier for heaven and
earth to pass away, than for one stroke of a letter in the law
to be dropped.   &quot;Anyone who divorces his wife and marries
another commits adultery, and whoever marries a woman divorced
from her husband commits adultery.   Jesus said to his disciples,
&quot;Occasions for stumbling are bound to come, but woe to anyone
by whom they come!   It would be better for you if a millstone
were hung around your neck and you were thrown into the sea than
for y   ou to cause one of the on your guard! If another disciple
sins, you must rebuke the offender, and if there is repentance,
you must forgive.  And if the same person sins against you seven
times a day, and turns back to you seven times and says, 'I repent,'
you must forgive.&quot;</B>
<P>
 Though these sayings seem to be disparate they all cluster around
the idea that in marriage, relationships, and friendships God
must hold center place.  There is no possibility in real discipleship
that God will be dethroned by anger or malice; thus anger and
malice have no place in the heart or life of the disciple.
<P>
<B> The Lord replied, &quot;If you had faith the size of a mustard
seed, you could say to this mulberry tree, 'Be uprooted and planted
in the sea,' and it would obey you.</B>
<P>
 Faith is the operative principle of kingdom citizenship.  Faith
in what is said by God rather than in what one sees in life. 
In short, faith replaces sight as the operative principle of existence.
 But this is not blind faith; it is faith based on the faithfulness
of God. and thus the most sure sighted faith there can possibly
be.
<P>
<B> They will say to you, 'Look there!' or 'Look here!' Do not
go, do not set off in pursuit.   For as the lightning flashes
and lights up the sky from one side to the other, so will the
Son of Man be in his day.  But first he must endure much suffering
and be rejected by this generation.   Just as it was in the days
of Noah, so too it will be in the days of the Son of Man.   They
were eating and drinking, and marrying and being given in marriage,
until the day Noah entered the ark, and the flood came and destroyed
all of them.    lain, just as it was in the days of Lot: they
were eating and drinking, buying and selling, planting and building,
 but on the day that Lot left Sodom, it rained fire and sulfur
from heaven and destroyed all of them -it will be like that on
the day that the Son of Man is revealed.  On that day, anyone
on the housetop who has belongings in the house must not come
down to take them away; and likewise anyone in the field must
not turn back.   Remember Lot's wife.   Those who try to make
their life secure will lose it, but those who lose their life
will keep it.   I tell you, on that night there will be two in
one bed; one will be taken and the other left.   There will be
two women grinding meal together; one will be taken and the other
left.&quot;   Then they asked him, &quot;Where, Lord?&quot; He
said to them, &quot;Where the corpse is, there the vultures will
gather.&quot;  As they were listening to this, he went on to tell
a parable, because he was near Jerusalem, and because they supposed
that the kingdom of God was to appear immediately.   So he said,
&quot;A nobleman went to a distant country to get royal power
for himself and then return.   He summoned ten of his slaves,
and gave them ten pounds, and said to them, 'Do business with
these until I come back.'   But the citizens of his country hated
him and sent a delegation after him, saying, 'We do not want this
man to rule over us.'   When he returned, having received royal
power, he ordered these slaves, to    whom he had given the he
might find out what they had gained by trading.  The first came
forward and said, 'Lord, your pound has made ten more pounds.'
  He said to him, 'Well done, good slave! Because you have been
trustworthy in a very small thing, take charge of ten cities.'
   Then the second came, saying, 'Lord, your pound has made five
pounds.'   He said to him, 'And you, rule over five cities.' 
 Then the other came, saying, 'Lord, here is your pound. I wrapped
it up in a piece of cloth,  for I was afraid of you, because you
are a harsh man; you take what you did not deposit, and reap what
you did not sow.'  He said to him, 'I will judge you by your own
words, you wicked slave! You knew, did you, that I was a harsh
man, taking what I did not deposit and reaping what I did not
sow?   Why then did you not put my money into the bank? Then when
I returned, I could have collected it with interest.'  He said
to the bystanders, 'Take the pound from him and give it to the
one who has ten pounds.'  'I tell you, to all those who have,
more will be given; but from those who have nothing, even what
they have will be taken away. </B>
<P>
<B> But as for these enemies of mine who did not want me to be
king over them-bring them here and slaughter them in my presence.'
   &quot;You are those who have stood by me in my trials;  and
I confer on you, just as my Father has conferred on me, a kingdom,
 so that you may eat and dri   nk at my table in my krones judging
the twelve tribes of Israel.</B>
<P>
 This last complex of sayings concludes the work of the historical
Jesus and rightly includes a discussion of the return of the Son
of Man.  In these passages Jesus reassures his disciples that
he will return in glory to establish the messianic kingdom.
<P>
 These sayings most probably occurred in the last weeks of Jesus'
life when he was certain that his end was near.  Thus, he tells
the disciples that he will return.  They must be on guard and
ever faithful to the call and commands of the true Master lest
he find them asleep when he does return.
