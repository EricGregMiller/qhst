<B>He also told them a parable: &quot;Can a blind person guide
a blind person? Will not both fall into a pit?  A disciple is
not above the teacher, but everyone who is fully qualified will
be like the teacher.  </B>
<P>
 Egalitarianism is the hallmark of those people who have joined
themselves to the Kingdom of God.  There is no hierarchy in the
Kingdom- only equality.  This idea held by the historical Jesus
was soon abandoned by the church for a structure more akin to
Roman administration.  Nevertheless, the ideal of Jesus was a
community where no one was more important than another; where
there were no &quot;blind and sighted&quot;.  Rather, all were
to be equally qualified to lead one another and teach one another.

<B>Why do you see the speck in your neighbor's eye, but do not
notice the log in your own eye?   Or how can you say to your neighbor,
'Friend, let me take out the speck in your eye,' when you yourself
do not see the log in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take
the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to
take the speck out of your neighbor's eye.</B>
<P>
 Likewise, kingdom participants must not waste their time trying
to correct others until they have corrected themselves.  Only
then can they help those around them.  
<P>
<B>&quot;No good tree bears bad fruit, nor again does a bad tree
bear good fruit; for each tree is known by its own fruit. Figs
are not gathered from thorns, nor are grapes picked from a bramble
bush.   The good person out of the good treasure of the heart
produces good, and the evil person out of evil treasure produces
evil; for it is out of the abundance of the heart that the mouth
speaks.</B>
<P>
<B> </B>Those who are truly participants in the Kingdom produce
lives that show they belong to the &quot;tree&quot; of the kingdom.
 The kingdom person acts like Jesus while the mere dilettante
does not.
<P>
<B> &quot;Why do you call me 'Lord, Lord,' and do not do what
I tell you?  I will show you what someone is like who comes to
me, hears my words, and    acts on them. </B>
<P>
That one is like a man building a house, who dug deeply and laid
the foundation on rock; when a flood arose, the river burst against
that house but could not shake it, because it had been well built.
 But the one who hears and does not act is like a man who built
a house on the ground without a foundation. When the river burst
against it, immediately it fell, and great was the ruin of that
house.&quot; 
<P>
 Here, as elsewhere, the simple truth which Jesus proclaims is
illustrated by a parable so simple that even the simplest mind
is capable of grasping it.  These parables of Jesus simply contain
a general truth.  In this particular parable the simple truth
is that a fool does not do what Jesus says to do while a wise
person does do what Jesus says to do.  Those who hear and do not
act are fools while those who hear and do act are wise!  The kingdom,
then, is occupied by wise people and not foolish people.
<P>
<B>i40 After Jesus had finished all his sayings in the hearing
of the people, he entered Capernaum.   A centurion there had a
slave whom he valued highly, and who was ill and close to death.
   When he heard about Jesus, he sent some Jewish elders to him,
asking him to come and heal his slave.  When they came to Jesus,
they appealed to him earnestly, saying, &quot;He is worthy of
having you do this for him,  for he loves our people, and it is
he who built our synagogue for us.&quot;   And Jesus went with
them, but when he was not far from the house, the centurion sent
friends to say to him, &quot;Lord, do not trouble yourself, for
I am not worthy to have you come under my roof; therefore I did
not presume to come to you. But only speak the word, and let my
servant be healed.    f1   authority, with soldiers under me;
and I say to one, 'Go,' and he goes, and to another, 'Come,' and
he comes, and to my slave, 'Do this,' and the slave does it.&quot;
  When Jesus heard this he was amazed at him, and turning to the
crowd that followed him, he said, &quot;I tell you, not even in
Israel have I found such faith.&quot;   When those who had been
sent returned to the house, they found the slave in good health.</B>
<P>
 The healings of Jesus were, according to Dom Crossan, not so
much physical restorations of health as the restoration of a place
in society.  Then, these re-alignments of a social place, brought
about health.  In other words, healing was restoration which then
brought about physical health.
<P>
 To understand this one must understand that in the world of Jesus
illness made one unapproachable and socially an outcast.  Therefore
Jesus_92 healings were the readmittance of the ill into the social
structure.  In short, Jesus simply told folk that they were part
of the Kingdom and therefore not castaways any longer.  For many
the beneficial result of this inclusion in a family was the fact
that wellness came about because of their new sense of well being.
<P>
 I think that is exactly what we have here.  Jesus declares one
to be well in the sense that he need not worry that he is alone-
for he is no longer alone.  As a result happiness replaces sorrow
and wellness replaces sickness. 
<P>
 This approach to the healings performed by Jesus allows one to
continue asserting that Jesus healed people while at the same
time it avoids the notion that Jesus was a magician or some kindred
to modern day &quot;faith healers&quot;.
<P>
 
<P>
<B> The disciples of John reported all these things to him. So
John summoned two of his disciples and sent them to the Lord to
ask, &quot;Are you the one who is to come, or    are we to wait
for anoer  When the men had come to him, they said, &quot;John
the Baptist has sent us to you to ask, 'Are you the one who is
to come, or are we to wait for another?' &quot;   Jesus had just
then cured many people of diseases, plagues, and evil spirits,
and had given sight to many who were blind.   And he answered
them, &quot;Go and tell John what you have seen and heard: the
blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed,
the deaf hear, the dead are raised, the poor have good news brought
to them.  And blessed is anyone who takes no offense at me.&quot;
 When John's messengers had gone, Jesus began to speak to the
crowds about John:   &quot;What did you go out into the wilderness
to look at? A reed shaken by the wind?   What then did you go
out to see? Someone dressed in soft robes? Look, those who put
on fine clothing and live in luxury are in royal palaces. What
then did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more
than a prophet.  This is the one about whom it is written,</B>
<P>
<B>'See, I am sending my messenger ahead of you,</B>
<P>
<B>who will prepare your way before you.'  I tell you, among those
born of women no one is greater than John; yet the least in the
kingdom of God is greater than he.&quot;</B>
<P>
<B>&quot;To what then will I compare the people of this generation,
and what are they like? They are like children sitting in the
marketplace and calling to one another,</B>
<P>
<B> 'We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we wailed,
and you did not weep.'  For John the Baptist has come eating no
bread and drinki   ng no wine, and you saain the Son of Man has
come eating and drinking, and you say, 'Look, a glutton and a
drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!' Nevertheless,
wisdom is vindicated by all her children.&quot;</B>
<P>
 The relationship of Jesus to the Baptist is quite easy to reconstruct
historically.  John began to preach in the wilderness in order
to reinvigorate Judaism and prepare it for the soon coming Messiah.
 In order to accomplish his mission he re-enacted the entry of
the chosen people into the promised land by having those who heard
him and agreed with his vision to pass through the waters of the
Jordan.  Jesus was attracted to this reform movement and also
passed through the waters as part of the reinvigorated nation.

<P>
 At some point immediately following this even Jesus also began
to preach.  That Jesus and John were not close acquaintances and
certainly not relatives is demonstrated by this passage where
John professes not to know what Jesus is doing or who he is! 
The purpose of  Matthew and Luke linking John to Jesus familially
is not quite clear.  evidently the early Church saw a need to
relate the two; but such a need is now no longer clear.  Perhaps
it was because there was tension between the disciples of Jesus
and the disciples of John.  And perhaps in an effort to ameliorate
this tension the Gospel writers connected the two by blood in
an effort to say &quot;we should not be fighting because we are
really related&quot;.
