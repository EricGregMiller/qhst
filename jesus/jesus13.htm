<B>When the crowds were increasing, he began to say, &quot;This
generation is an evil generation; it asks for a sign, but no sign
will be given to it except the sign of Jonah.   For just as Jonah
became a sign to the people of Nineveh, so the Son of Man will
be to this generation.   The queen of the South will rise at the
judgment with the people of this generation and condemn them,
because she came from the ends of the earth to listen to the wisdom
of Solomon, and see, something greater than Solomon is here! 
 </B>
<P>
<B>The people of Nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this
generation and condemn it, because they repented at the proclamation
of Jonah, and see, something greater than Jonah is here!</B>
<P>
 Those missionaries mentioned earlier went from town to town and
preached the ethic of love expedient for kingdom citizens. Those
who accepted their message were welcomed into the circle of disciples
while those who did not were upbraided for their hardness of heart.
 The fate of these kingdom rejecters is judgment.  
<P>
 What is so peculiar about this is that it seems to be opposed
to Jesus simple preaching of the Gospel and leaving the response
to the individual.  It seems, therefore, that this segment of
text would belong to the work of the early church as it spread
out and was being rejected in some quarters.  In response to this
rejection, threats were tendered.  This is the way many scholars
view the issue.
<P>
 However, there is nothing unreasonable in assuming that Jesus
did proclaim judgment on those who rejected the    Kingdom; for
in sum th- not his message but the Kingdom and therefore God himself.
 For an enthusiastic follower of God such rejection is worthy
of denunciation.  Thus in my view these sentences clearly stem
from the historical Jesus.
<P>
<B>&quot;No one after lighting a lamp puts it in a cellar, but
on the lampstand so that those who enter may see the light.  Your
eye is the lamp of your body. If your eye is healthy, your whole
body is full of light; but if it is not healthy, your body is
full of darkness.   Therefore consider whether the light in you
is not darkness.</B>
<P>
 This saying reminds the disciples that they are to be straightforward
and up front about their commitment to the kingdom.  They must
not play the hypocrite and hide the light that is within them.
 Since they have opened their eyes to the light they can now no
longer stumble around in the dark.
