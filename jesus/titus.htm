<B>The Book of Titus</B> 
<P>
<B>I. Title</B> 
<P>
The title is derived from the name of the man to whom the letter
was addressed.
<P>
<B>II. Author and Setting</B> 
<P>
The author was Paul, according to Titus 1:1-4a:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ for the
faith of God's elect and the knowledge of the truth that leads
to godliness....

<BLOCKQUOTE>
To Titus, my true son in our common faith:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Titus is never mentioned by name in the book of Acts, and his
name appears elsewhere in only three of Paul's other letters:
2 Corinthians 2:13, 7:6, 13, 14, 8:6, 16, 23, 12:18; Galatians
2:1, 3; and 2 Timothy 4:10. Very little is known about him. Galatians
2:1-3 indicates that when Paul went from Antioch to Jerusalem
to discuss the gospel message he was preaching, he took along
Titus, an uncircumcised young Greek, as an example of the fruit
of the gospel message.
<P>
About a year before writing 2 Corinthians, Paul sent Titus to
Corinth to get their help in collecting for the saints in Judea
(1 Corinthians 16:1-4; 2 Corinthians 9:2 and 12:18). Shortly after
writing 1 Corinthians, Paul sent Titus back to Corinth, to help
straighten out some additional problems there. His failure to
return when expected caused Paul anxiety (2 Corinthians 2:12-
13). Paul left for Macedonia, hoping to find Titus; there, he
did find him, with the happy news that things had been settled
in Corinth (2 Corinthians 7:5-7).
<P>
Paul wrote the second letter to Corinth then and sent it back
with Titus, instructing him to complete the collection for the
saints in Judea (2 Corinthians 8:6,7, 16-24).
<P>
The letter was probably written to Titus on Crete about AD 63,
not long after Paul had left Crete. Paul's visit to Crete occurred
sometime after his first imprisonment in Rome (Acts 28).

<B>Questions on Titus</B> 
<P>
1. When was the letter to Titus written?
<P>
2. What does Paul say about the place of women in the church in
Titus? How is it to be reconciled with Galatians 3:26-29, 1 Timothy
2:9-15 and 1 Corinthians 11:5?
<P>
3. What does Paul have to say about overseers (bishops or elders)?
<P>
4. Reconcile what Paul says in Titus 3:9 with what he does in
Galatians 3:16-18 and Galatians 2:11-21, or elsewhere where he
discusses the contrast between Law and Grace. Also, how is this
statement to be understood in light of 2 Timothy 3:16-17 and the
genealogies in the Old Testament?
