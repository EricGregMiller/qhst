<B>&quot;Do not judge, and you will not be judged; do not condemn,
and you will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven;
 give, and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down,
shaken together, running over, will be put into your lap; for
the measure you give will be the measure you get back.&quot;

 For Jesus, there is nothing quite so condemnable as condemantion.
 Now, to be sure, these sayings of Jesus have been sorely misunderstood
by many folks who take them to means something like &quot;don't
ever say anything about anyone or you are judging them&quot;.
 Jesus' intention, however, is to do away with condemnation and
not judgment.  Condemnation is, then, the declaration that someone
is going to hell.  Judgment, on the other hand, is nothing but
making a distinction or a discrimination.  Jesus somewhere else
said &quot;you can know a tree by the fruit it bears&quot;.  That
is judgment.
<P>
 Hand in hand with the idea that people should not condemn is
the idea that giving is the flip side of a condemnationless existence.
 One cannot condemn the poor and at the same time give them what
they need.
