<P>
<B>John said to the crowds that came out to be baptized by him,
&quot;You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath
to come?  Bear fruits worthy of repentance. Do not begin to say
to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our ancestor'; for I tell you,
God is able from these stones to raise up children to Abraham.
 Even now the ax is lying at the root of the trees; every tree
therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown
into the fire.&quot;</B>
<P>
 The message preached by John is summarized by Q.  True relationship
to God is not based on ancestral connection but by personal commitment.
 John thus calls his hearers to rely not on their DNA but on their
own dependence on God.  This message would have been very attractive
to Jesus, who had grown up in Nazareth, a stones throw from the
great Roman city of Sepphoris.  There (in Sepphoris) Jesus had
seen first hand the results of Roman decadence and how that had
influenced his own neighbors and friends.  Living so close to
a Roman city would have proven far too powerful for many of Jesus'
schoolmates- who would have been attracted to the pagan lifestyle
enjoyed by those more enlightened citizens of the great metropolis.
 Abandoning the &quot;faith of the fathers&quot; many of Jesus
contemporaries probably became Romans in faith and practice.
<P>
<B> John answered all of them by saying, &quot;I baptize you with
water; but one who is more powerful than I is coming; I am not
worthy to untie the thong of his sandals. He will baptize you
with the Holy Spirit and fire.  His winnowing fork is in his hand,
to clear his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into his
granary; but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.&quot;</B>
<P>
 As John preached this message something within Jesus resonated
and he knew that it was he.  Further, he knew that he had been
commissioned by God to carry out the messianic task.  To learn
what this task was, he would simply have drawn on the Old Testament
texts which he interpreted as messianic.  The remarkable thing
here is that he did not drawn on the texts which describe the
messiah as the victorious conqueror; but on those texts which
portray the messiah as the suffering servant (i.e., Is 53, etc.).
 His choice of texts is    illustrated in his ina in Capernaum
(cf. Luke 4).  From these passages we get a very clear glimpse
of how Jesus saw himself and what he conceived his forthcoming
ministry to be.
<P>
 The Synoptics describe Jesus' baptism; but Q does not.  For this
reason we bypass that event and move to the next experience in
the life of the man from Galilee.
