&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Note first of all that on the seventh line a word is circled because its letters are different than the rest.  This is Archaic Hebrew Script -- and here it is the word YHWH (or Yahweh, the name of God in the Old Testament).  The Qumran Essenes held the word as especially sacred, and in order to avoid pronouncing it they wrote it in this script in many of the texts.  The Arabic numbers in the left collumn correspond to the text in Habakkuk.<P>
