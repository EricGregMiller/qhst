<p>
<p>When -h occurs at the end of a word it indicates direction toward (just as in Hebrew).  Sometimes -t occurs with the same sense.  Suffixed -m is used as an accusative in many instances.  Sometimes a preposition used in one line is balanced by -m in the next.  Also, enclitic -m can be added to a verb for ballast in a hemistich.  -m can even be attached to a noun in the construct state.<p>
<p>The noun bt may be used adverbially; i.e., “bt ikl” means “in the house of eating”.<p>
<p>ahr is also used adverbially and means afterwards while when ap is used in this way it means also, even.<p>
