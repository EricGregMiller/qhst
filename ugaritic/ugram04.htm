<p><B>3. Possessive:</B><p>
<p> When a word show possession, it ends in -y in the 1st person singular.  In the 2 and 3 person singular the ending is -k (or sometimes -n) or -h (respectively).  When a word is a dual the ending is -ny (1st person), -hm (3rd person), -n (1st plural), -km (2nd plural), -hm (3rd plural).  When possession is emphatic the independent pronoun may be added (as in Hebrew).<p>
