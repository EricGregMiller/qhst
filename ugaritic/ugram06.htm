<p>The Ugaritic noun distinguishes two genders, masculine and feminine; three numbers, singular, dual, and plural, and three cases, nominative, genitive and accusative; and two states, absolute and construct.<p>
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE><p>Masc. Sing. = no additional ending to the stem of the noun.<p>
<p>Fem. Sing. = -at or -t.<p>
<p>Dual = -ama (nom), -em (gen. and acc).<p>
<p>Masc. Pl. = -uma, (nom);  -ima, (gen. and acc.)<p>
<p>Fem. Pl. = -atu (nom); -ati (gen. and acc.)</BLOCKQUOTE><p>
<p>
<p>As in Hebrew and other Semitic languages, some nouns that are singular in form function as plurals.  The translator must become context sensitive in order to determine this usage.<p>
<p>
<p>Likewise, the construct state occurs in Ugaritic as in Hebrew.  In Ugaritic, nothing can be interposed between the construct and its genitive.<p>
<p>
<p>Ugaritic also makes use of  the directive -h.  As in Hebrew, when -h is affixed to the end of the noun, the translation must reflect ‘direction towards’.    I.e., ‘arsh’  means “earthward”, etc. <p>
<p>
<p>Adjectives in Ugaritic is inflected like the noun; and agrees with its noun in gender, number, and case.<p>
