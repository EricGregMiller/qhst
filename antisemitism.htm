        If one does a search on the web, one can find any number of neo-nazi and other 
        related hate sites that will try to justify persecution of Jewish people in a 
        number of ways. Some will deny that the Holocaust ever occured. Others will 
        claim to be Christian, they will deny that they hate anyone, and they will 
        often have inocuous sounding names for their websites. Don't be confused. Those 
        who attempt to use the Bible to argue that the Jewish people are the enemies of 
        God, those who try to argue that the Jewish people are not related to the 
        Israelites of the Bible, those who try to deny that Jesus and the apostles were 
        Jewish, are nothing but Anti-Semitic, hate filled neo-Nazis.<P>
          What we have attempted to do here is respond to the unbiblical and unhistorical 
          attacks leveled by those who will try to misuse the Bible and history to deny 
          that the Jewish people are descended from Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, or who try 
          to argue the racist doctrine that the white, Anglo-Saxons are the true 
          Israelites.
