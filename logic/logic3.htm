<b>B. Theory of Knowledge</b>
<P>
 The study of the theory of knowledge is called epistemology.
 It comprises the systematic study of the 1) nature, 2) sources
and 3) validity of knowledge.
<P>
 Epistimology asks the question: &quot;Do we know an independent
world or merely our experience?&quot;  The answers reveal two
kinds of theories of knowledge, which may be grouped with regard
to their degree of emphasis on the subjectivity or objectivity
of knowledge.
<P>
  1. Subjectivistic theories of knowledge
<P>
 These theories answer the question of epistemology thus: &quot;No,
we don't know an independent world as the cause of our ideas.
 We cannot get beyond our experience or ideas, and we cannot speak
of a knower experiencing them.&quot;
<P>
  2. Objectivistic theories of knowledge
<P>
 These theories answer the question of epistemology thus: &quot;Yes,
we do know an idependent world of material objects or of transcendent
ideas.&quot;
<P>
 C. Kinds of knowledge
<P>
  1. Knowledge by acquaintance
<P>
 Knowledge by acquaintance is the direct apprehension of: a) sense
data, b) objects of memory, c) internal states, and d) ourselves.
<P>
  2. Knowledge by description
<P>
 Knowledge by description is the mediated or thought out knowledge
of a) other selves, and b) physical objects (as constructs and
not sense data).
