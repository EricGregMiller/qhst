<P>
What is Logic?  It is the study of the principles of reasoning, especially valid reasoning,
as distinguished from invalid or irrational argumentation.
<P>
 Logic is studied as a means of testing the validity of arguments
-- specifically decutive arguments.  An argument is a sequence
of statements, one of which, the conclusion, is said to be logically
deducible from, or a logical consequence of, the others, which
are called premises.
<P>
<b>Examples of arguments:</b>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>1. Sophocles was a philosopher or Socrates was a dramatist;
<P>
Sophocles was not a philosopher;
<P>
Therefore, Socrates was a dramatist.
<P>
2. Some philosophers are Platonists;
<P>
Some mathematicians are philosophers;
<P>
Therefore, some mathematicians are Platonists.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 Arguments thus make claims, namely, that certain conclusions
follow logically from, or are logical consequences of, certain
premises.  We count on logic to tell us just which arguments make
valid claims and which do not.
<P>
<b>VALIDITY</b>
<P>
 What is a valid claim?  Before this question can be answered,
a distinction must be made between the validity of an argument
and the truth of its conclusion.  These are not the same: not
all valid arguments yield true conclusions -- see 1 above.  Conversely,
not all arguments that yield true conclusions are valid -- see
2 above.  Similarly, there are valid arguments with false premises,
like 1 and there are invalid arguments with true premises, like
2.  The question of the validity of an argument is therefore separate
from that of the truth or falsity of its premises and conclusion.
 To say that an argument is therefore separate from the truth
or falsity of its premises and conclusion.  To say that an argument
is valid is to say that its conclusion is a logical consequence
of the premises, which is to say simply that if the premises are
all true, then the conclusion must also be true.  No claim is
made with respect to the actual truth or falsity of any premise
or conclusion; however, if the argument is valid, then it cannot
be the case that the premises are all true and the conclusion
false.
<P>
 It is helpful to use another term, &quot;sound&quot;, to refer
to arguments that are both valid and contain true premises.  Thus
sound arguments satisfy two conditions a) they are valid and b)
they proceed from true premises.  Since the logical consequences
of true premises must be true, sound arguments necessarily have
true conclusions.  An example is the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>3. All human beings are mortal.
<P>
Socrates is a human being.
<P>
Therefore, Socrates is mortal.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 Logic limits its concern strictly to problems of validity; the
task of obtaining true or well-confirmed premises it leaves to
other disciplines; however, the task of this class is to include
some of those other disciplines.
<P>
So, we will also study the nature of induction, which covers all
cases of nondemonstrative argument, in which the truth of the
premises, while not entailing the truth of the conclusion, purports
to be a good reason for belief in it.  Under this category, we
would include the scientific method.
<P>
 The purpose of this study of course, is to help you discern the
truth when you see it, and a lie when you see it.
<P>

<P>
<b> A. Questions</b>
<P>
 <i> 1. What is mind?</i>
<P>
 This is also called the mind-body problem.  Is the distinction
between mind and body valid?  It was Plato who was the first to
make a sharp distinction between the mind and the body, holding
that the mind could exist both before and after its residence
in the body and could rule the body during that residence.  St.
Augustine further developed this distinction and theorized I
more detail about the relation between the two.  But it was Descartes
who first developed a systematic theory of the natures and interrelationship
of mind and body.
<P>
<i>  2. What is known?</i>
<P>
 That which is true.
<P>
 <i> 3. What is knowing?</i>
<P>
 Discovering that which is true. The process of apprehending that
which is true.
<P>
 <i> 4. What is true?</i>
<P>
 It has been suggested that the requirement that what is known
be true is excessively stringent.  Complete certainty of a statement's
truth is not to be had; the best we can achieve is very strong
grounds for thinking it true. Thus, if knowledge entails truth,
we can never attain knowledge or, at any rate, never know that
we have done so.
<P>
 This objection is misconceived.
<P>
 If I firmly believe that something is true on what I take to
be sufficient grounds, I am right to say that I know it.  It may
be that the grounds are, in fact, insufficient and that what I
claim to know is false.  In that case my claim is mistaken, but
it does not follow that I was wrong to make it in the sense that
I had no justification for doing so.
<P>
 It has also been argued, with a view to showing that knowledge
and belief are quite distinct and unrelated, that whereas beliefs
can be true or false, knowledge is neither.  The argument exploits
the fact that we speak of a belief but not of knowledge.  Furthermore,
since all items or pieces of knowledge are by definition true,
we never need to speak of them as true items or pieces in order
to distinguish them from false ones.
<P>
<i>  5. What is valid?</i>
<P>
 A logical argument.
<P>
<i>  6. What is scientific?</i>
<P>
 The scientific method: questioning, redundancy, testing.
<P>
<i>  7. Is genuine knowledge possible?</i>
<P>
 Can we really know anything at all?
<P>
<i>  8. Is knowing innate or experienced or both?</i>
<P>
 Are we born with knowledge, or does it all come to us from outside
sources?  A priori vs. a posteriori.  I think, therefore I am,
vs. the sky is blue.
<P>
 What are the answers?  Are there any answers?  Are any answers
possible?
<P>
 At first glance, these may sound like the sort of questions blitzed
college students would be asking themselves at two in the morning.
 However, they actually have relevance and importance -- because
they will help you form your <I>grundstam</I>, your basis, your
foundation.
<P>
 Socrates said that you must &quot;know yourself&quot;, and &quot;the
life unknown is not worth living.&quot;  It is a requirement for
reasoned thinking that you know what you believe and why, and
so it is necessary to begin at the very bottom, at the most basic
presuppositions that you take so much for granted that you don't
even know they could be questioned or that other points of view
could even be possible.
<P>
<b>Paradox</b>
<P>
 Blue sky, sunshine, deja vu glazed with dread.  Something horrible
is going to happen about now.  It is a perfect summer day in a
meadow of tall grass.  J.V. is following her brothers, lagging
lazily behind.  A shadow falls on the ground; something rustles
the grass.  J.V. turns --  she cannot help it, it is what happens
next -- and sees a strange man.  He has no face, like a minor
character in a dream.  The man holds something writhing and indistinct.
 He asks, &quot;How would you like to get into this bag with the
snakes.&quot;
<P>
 J.V.'s encounter is an unlikely milestone in twentieth century
thought.  J.V., a fourteen year old girl, was not in a summer
field but on an operating table in the Montreal Neurological Institute.
 Her physician, Wilder Penfield, was attempting an experimental
operation to relieve her violent epileptic seizures.  The operating
team had removed the side of J.V.'s skull to expose the temporal
lobe of the brain.  In order to locate the site of the attacks,
Penfield probed the brain with an electrode connected to an EEG
machine.  The surgery was a collaboration between physician and
patient.  J.V.had to remain conscious throughout and help locate
the site of the seizures.  When Penfield touched the probe to
a certain spot on J.V.'s temporal lobe, she again found herself
in the field of grass...
<P>
 J.V.'s experience with the strange man had occurs seven years
earlier, in Canada, in what we call the real world.  She reported
seeing herself as she was then, a seven year old girl.  J.V. had
been frightened but not physically harmed, and ran crying home
to her mother.  These few moments of terror were to haunt her
over and over.  The man with the bag of snakes entered her dreams,
made them nightmares.  The trauma became interwoven with her epileptic
seizures.  Like a madeleine, a fleeting recollection would trigger
the whole memory, then an attack.
<P>
 Under the EEG probe, J.V. not merely recalled, but relived the
encounter.  All the richness of detail, all the lucid horror of
the original experience, came back.  Penfield's probe caused the
brain to replay past experiences like a movie.  With bits of lettered
or numbered paper, Penfield kept track of the sites on the cerebral
cortex associated with the recollection.  Touching nearby points
produced different sensations.  When the probe touched one point,
J.V. remembered people scolding her for doing something wrong.
Other sites produced only a phantasmagoria of colored stars. (pp.

Doubleday -- this is an incident that happened in the 1930's)
<P>
<b>BRAINS IN VATS</b>
<P>
You think you're sitting there in that chair, when really you're
a disembodied brain in a laboratory somewhere, soaking in a vat
of nutrients.  Electrodes are attached to the brain, and a mad
scientist is feeding it a stream of electrical impulses that
exactly simulates the experience of sitting in class.
<P>
<b>DREAMS</b>
<P>
&quot;How do you know this isn't all a dream?&quot;
<P>
The best known tale of this sort is the Chinese tale of Chuang-tzu,
dating from the fourth century BC.  Chuang-tzu was the man who
dreamt he was a butterfly, then awoke and wondered if he was a
butterfly dreaming he was a man.
<P>
 The fable is unconvincing, however.  It is true that we usually
don't realize we're dreaming, but a waking person always knows
he's not dreaming, right?
<P>
 Opinions differ.
<P>
 Rene Descartes in his &quot;First Meditation&quot; (1641) decided
he couldn't be ABSOLUTELY sure he wasn't dreaming.  Most people
would probably disagree with Descartes.  You're not dreaming now,
and you know it because experiences in dreams are different from
those in waking life.
<P>
 Saying exactly HOW they're different is difficult.
<P>
 1. Pain -- pinching yourself?  But I've felt pain in dreams.
<P>
 2. Few dreams are in color, so if you can see color -- but then
again, maybe you dream in color.
<P>
 3. Real life usually seems more detailed.  If you can add a column
of numbers then check the results on a calculator, then you're
awake.  Or if you examine a wall and can see all the little cracks,
then you're awake.
<P>
 Or, maybe you're dreaming you're doing those things, now that
you've heard that such things can &quot;prove&quot; you're awake.
<P>
 4. Some say the fact you wonder if you're dreaming or awake proves
you're awake -- except then you could never dream in which you
realize you're dreaming.
<P>
 5. Keep a book of limericks by your bed.  Don't read it.  But
whenever you want to know if you're dreaming, open it at random
and read a limerick, making sure it is one you've never read or
heard before.  Most likely you cannot compose a bonafide limerick
on a moments notice. (of course Samuel Taylor Coleridge composes
his masterwork &quot;Kubla Khan&quot; in a dream.  Of course,
Coleridge was a poet in his waking life; the limerick test is
only good for people who can't easily compose a limerick.)
<P>
<b>DREAM OF A DIFFERENT SORT</b>
<P>
 Renes Descartes and his evil genius bent on deceiving him, a
malicious demon of the utmost power.
<P>
<b>AMBIGUITY</b>
<P>
 BRAINS in VATS is the quintessential illustration of what philosophers
call the &quot;problem of knowledge&quot;.  The point is not the
remote possibility that we are all brains in vats but that we
may be just as deluded in ways we cannot even imagine.
<P>
<b> HOW DO WE KNOW ANYTHING FOR SURE?</b>
<P>
 The whole of experience is a stream of nerve impulses.  The roughness
of a stone, the sound of a coin dropping on the floor, the odor
of a fart.  We have all IMAGINED a world that might account for
the unique set of nerve impulses we have received since (and several
months before) birth.  The conventional picture of a real, external
world is not the only possible explanation for the neural experience.
 We are forced to admit that an evil genius or a brains in vats
experiment could explain the neural experience just as well. 
Experience is forever equivocal.
<P>
 Science places great faith in the evidence of the senses.
<P>
 Most people are skeptical about ghosts, the Loch Ness monster,
and flying saucers, not because they are inherently stupid notions,
but only because no one has produced unquestionable sensory evidence
for them.  Brains in vats turns this apparently reasonable skepticism
inside out.  How can you know, by the evidence of your senses,
that you are not a brain in a vat?  You can't!
<P>
 The belief that you are NOT a brain in a vat can never be disproven
empirically.  In the jargon of philosophy it is &quot;evidence
transcendent.&quot;
<P>
 This is a serious blow to the idea that &quot;everything can
be determined scientifically.&quot;  At issue is not some bit
of trivia such as the color of a tyrannosaurus.  If we cannot
even know whether the external world exists, then there are profound
limitations on knowledge.  Our conventional view of things might
be outrageously wrong.
<P>
<b>IS ANYTHING CERTAIN?</b>
<P>
 Descartes' evil genius was the starting point of an investigation
into how we know what we know.  Descartes wrote: &quot;Some years
ago I was struck by the large number of falsehoods that I had
accepted as true in my childhood, and by the highly doubtful nature
of the whole edifice that I had subsequently based on them.  I
realized that it was necessary, once in the course of my life,
to demolish everything completely and start again right from the
foundations if I wanted to establish anything at all in the sciences
that was stable and likely to last.&quot;
<P>
 Descartes wanted to address the problem of knowledge in much
the same way that Euclid had treated geometry two thousand years
earlier.  All of Euclid's geometry is deduced from a set of five
axioms.  An axiom was, in Euclid's time, a statement so obviously
true that one could not imagine a world in which it was false
( for instance: &quot;A straight line can be drawn between any
two points).  All the theorems -- provably true statements --
of traditional geometry can be derived from Euclid's five axioms.
<P>
 Descartes wanted to do the same thing with the facts of the real
world.  He needed to identify a set of facts known with utter
certainty.  These facts would be the axioms of his natural philosophy.
 Then he would establish valid rules of inference.  Finally, Descartes
would use those rules to deduce new facts from the original set
of incontestable facts.
<P>
 Unfortunately, almost any statement about the real world has
some degree of doubt.  Descartes found the ground floor of his
natural philosophy vanishing beneath his feet.
<P>
 This dizzying &quot;whirlpool&quot; aptly describes ONTOLOGY,
the study of what is real.  The first thing to realize in constructing
an ontology is to realize that the accepted, everyday &quot;facts&quot;
of the external world are disputable.
<P>
 You can almost always come up with a scenario in which unquestioned
beliefs can be wrong.
<P>
 Is Paris the capital of France.
<P>
 Probably.
<P>
 It's barely conceivable that our government is a totalitarian
conspiracy that, for reasons of its own, does not want its citizens
to know the REAL capital of France.  They've rewritten all the
history and geography books, and force teachers to indoctrinate
each new generation of children with the Paris fiction.  You say
you went to Paris last summer and saw a bunch of official looking
French government buildings there?  That could have been a theme-park
simulation maintained by our government to give its citizens the
illusion of freedom of travel.
<P>
 Wild fancies like this should not obscure the fact that some
things are more disputable than others.  By most people's standards,
the Loch Ness monster is less real than a tyrannosaurus, and both
are less real than the elephant you saw at the zoo last Sunday.
 What is most certain of all?
<P>
 A popular answer is the truth of logic and mathematics.  Even
if your first grade teacher was the dupe of a conspiracy bent
on teaching you falsehoods, you cannot doubt that 2 plus 2 is
4.  Right now, you can picture two things, and put two more things
beside them, and see that the total is four.  The deduction seems
obviously true in any possible world, be it the external world
we believe exists, the brain in vats laboratory, or something
stranger yet.
<P>
 But there are two problems with these answer.
<P>
1. You can take the ultra-skeptical position that even logic and
mathematics are an illusion.  Just because you don't see how you
could be wrong about 2 plus 2 is for doesn't guarantee it is right.
<P>
 Your brain is evidently in a certain state when you come to a
valid conclusion of logic or mathematics. What's to stop the brains
in vats overlords from deluding you about arithmetic as well as
the physical world?  Maybe 2 and 2 equals 62,987, but by stimulating
your brain in a precise way, the mad scientists have you thinking
it is four, and even thinking that it's OBVIOUS that it's 4 and
you can PROVE it is 4.  Maybe somewhere they've got a whole row
of brains in vats, each one believing in a different sum for 2
and 2 and immersed in a different &quot;reality&quot; consistent
with that sum.
<P>
 Philosophers rarely take skepticism so far.
<P>
2. The other, more pragmatic problem with restricting certainty
to logic and mathematics is that it leaves us with no way of justifying
beliefs about the physical world.  Certainty about 
is not going to tell us what the capital of France is.  So, are
there any facts, aside from logic and mathematics, about which
we can be certain?
<P>
We would prefer to think so; but belief in the possibility of knowledge is the consequence of our presuppositions -- and thus ultimately unprovable.  But, we will propose that it is not unreasonable, though there are schools of thought which would argue just the opposite...<P>
