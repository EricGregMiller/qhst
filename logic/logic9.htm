<b> I. The nature of linguistic meaning </b> <BR>
Linguistic meaning is the meaning of words, phrases, or sentences.
 There are many uses of the word &quot;mean&quot;, for instance:
 <BR>
1. That is no mean accomplishment (insignificant)  <BR>
2. He was so mean to me (cruel)  <BR>
3. I mean to help him if I can (intend)  <BR>
4. The passage of this bill will mean the end of life as we know
it (result in)  <BR>
5. Once again life has meaning for me (significance)  <BR>
6. What is the meaning of this (explanation)  <BR>
7. He just lost his job.  That means he will have to look for
a new one. (implies) <BR>
Theories of linguistic meaning are: <BR>
1. Referential theory  <BR>
a. Language is used to talk about things  <BR>
b. the meaning of an expression is that to which it refers or
the relation between the expression and its referent  <BR>
c. reference is by naming (words stand for something) or describing
<BR>
2. Ideational theory  <BR>
a. words or expressions have meaning as they are used to refer
to the idea that gives rise to them or to which they themselves
give rise; as in psychological effects in hearers. <BR>
3. Behavioral theory (or stimulous-response)  <BR>
a. words or expressions have meaning as they are used to refer
to the situation (stimulous) in which they are uttered and the
respoonses which they elicit  <BR>
b. meaning is a function of stimulous and response (Bloomfield)
 <BR>
c. Meaning is a function of behavioral disposition  <BR>
d. meaning is a function of the conditions under which it is uttered
 <BR>
e. three factors are involved: the symbol (i.e. words and expressions),
the thought (or interpretation), and the referent (or that refered
to).  We get from words to thingd indirectly, by way of thought.
<BR>
THOUGHT<BR>
(interpretation)<BR>
SYMBOL          REFERENT<BR>
(words)          (things) <BR>
4. Use theory  <BR>
a. meaning is a function of use  <BR>
b. words or expressions have meaning as they are used, e.g., to
perform any speech act and not only to refer to something, that
is, to name or describe.  <BR>
c. speech acts consist of:   <BR>
1) uttering sentences (locutionary acts)   <BR>
2) what is done by the speaker in uttering the sentence (illocutionary
acts, as, for instance, announce)   <BR>
3) the effect on the hearer (perlocutionary acts, as, e.g., encourage)
 <BR>
d. Two sentences have the same meaning if they are used to do
the same thing, that is, if they have the same illocutionary act
potential.  <BR>
e. To know what a sentence means is to know how to use it correctly.
 <BR>
f. Meaning is not what sentences have but what persons do with
them. <BR>
Meaning can be distinguished as cognitive or noncognitive (emotive)
 <BR>
1. Cognitive  <BR>
It is empirically verifiable or confirmable.  It has truth value
(i.e., it is true or false) and it is genuinely informative. 
<BR>
2. Noncognitive  <BR>
It is expressive of an emotion or feeling of the speaker, as in,
for instance, a value judgment.
