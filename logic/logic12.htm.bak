<b> L. Scientific method</b> <BR>
&quot;That method for describing and explaining phenomena which
incorporates the principles of empirical verification, operational
definition, controlled observation, statistical generalization,
and empirical confirmation.&quot; <BR>
1. Aristotle developed the following methods  <BR>
a. induction <BR>
Induction is reasoning from the particular to the general. e.g.:
simple enumeration Fact One, Fact Two, Fact Three... leads to
Generalization  <BR>
b. deduction <BR>
Deduction is reasoning from the general to the particular. E.G.:
if all cases of P imply Q, then this case of P implies Q.   <BR>
c. observation <BR>
The use of empirical evidence.  Instead of simply imagining what
water does at certain temperatures, you go out and see what happens
to it.   <BR>
d. classification <BR>
The use of definition.  <BR>
2. The method <BR>
It has become a series of steps varied according to the particular
discipline or problem at hand.  John Dewey, in his book HOW WE
THINK described it as reflective thinking and enumerated five
steps in problem solving as the pattern of inquiry or the scientific
method:   <BR>
a. awareness of the problem -- the indeterminate situation.  
<BR>
b. clarification of the indeterminate situation as a problematic
one by definition, observation and the classification of facts
  <BR>
c. formulation of a possible solution -- a hypothesis.   <BR>
d. deduction of verifiable or testable consequences   <BR>
e. verification and reformulation as necessary leading to acceptance
or rejection of the hypothesis and/or solution of the problem.
