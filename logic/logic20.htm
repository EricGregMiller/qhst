 <b> 2. Propositions</b>
<P>
   a. opposition
<P>
 The traditional logic of propositions or judgments is chiefly
concerned with the classification and simpler interrelations of
propositions formed from terms (for example, &quot;No men are
liars&quot;).
<P>
 Propositions not compounded of other propositions are called &quot;categorical&quot;.
 This word has the force of &quot;unconditional,&quot; the implied
contrast being with forms like &quot;<I>If</I> all that the Bible
says is true, all men are mortal&quot; or &quot;<I>Either</I>
not all that the Bible says is true, <I>or</I> all men are mortal.&quot;
 
<P>
 Categoricals have a <I>subject term</I> and a <I>predicate term</I>
(&quot;men&quot; is the subject term and &quot;mortal&quot; is
the predicate term of &quot;All men are mortal&quot;) and are
subdivided in two main ways: according to <I>quantity</I>, into
<I>universals</I> (&quot;All men are mortal,&quot; &quot;No men
are mortal&quot;) and <I>particulars</I> (&quot;Some men are mortal,&quot;
&quot;Some men are not mortal&quot;), and according to <I>quality</I>,
into <I>affirmatives</I> (&quot;All men are mortal,&quot; &quot;Some
men are mortal&quot;) and <I>negatives</I> (&quot;No men are mortal,&quot;
&quot;Some men are not mortal&quot;).  Universals are at the top, particulars at the bottom,
affirmatives on the left and negatives on the right:
<P>
All X's are Y's       No X's are Y's
<P>
All X's are Y's       Some X's are not Y's
<P>
 Universal affirmatives are called A-propositions, particular
affirmatives I-propositions, universal negatives E-propositions,
and particular negatives )-propositions (the vowels being taken
from the words <I>affirmo</I> and <I>nego</I>).  Two other &quot;quantities
are commonly mentioned, namely <I>singular</I> and <I>indefinite</I>.
 Singular propositions, such as &quot;Socrates is mortal,&quot;
are a genuinely distinct type, which we shall touch upoon at appropriate
points; indefinites, such as &quot;Men are mortal,&quot; seem
merely to be universals or particulars in which the quantity is
left unstateed.  The expressions other than terms which enter
into these forms are called &quot;syncategorematic&quot;; they
are divided into the signs of quantity &quot;all&quot; and &quot;some&quot;
and the copulas &quot;is&quot; or &quot;are&quot; and &quot;is
not&quot; or &quot;are not.&quot;  (&quot;No&quot; is both a sighn
of quantity and a sign of negation.)
<P>
 These types of propositions -- A, E, I, and O -- are the traditional
&quot;four forms&quot;, and as a preliminary to logical manipulation
it is customary to restate given sentences in some standard way
that will make their quanityt and quality immediately evident.
 The forms given above, with &quot;all,&quot; etc., and with plural
common nouns for terms, are the most widely used, but it is in
some ways less misleading to use &quot;every,&quot; etc., and
the terms in the singular -- &quot;Every X is a Y,&quot; &quot;No
X is a Y,&quot; &quot;Some X is a Y,&quot; &quot;Some X is not
a Y.&quot; What is important is to understand that &quot;some&quot;
means simply &quot;at least one&quot;; &quot;Some men are mortals&quot;
or &quot;Some man is a mortal&quot; must be understood as neither
affirming nor denying that more than one man is mortal and as
neither affirming nor denying that all men are (i.e., &quot;some&quot;
does NOT mean &quot;only some&quot;).
<P>
 A square of the type shown above is called a <I>square of opposition</I>,
and propositions with the same terms in the same order may be
&quot;opposed&quot; in four ways.  Universals of opposite quality
(&quot;Every X is a Y,&quot; &quot;No X is a Y&quot;) are said
to be <I>contraries</I>; these cannot be jointly true.  Particulars
of opposite quality (&quot;Some X is a Y,&quot; &quot;Some X is
not a Y&quot;) are said to be <I>subcontraries</I>; these cannot
be jointly false.  Propositions opposed only in quantity are said
to be <I>subalterns</I>, the <I>subalternant</I> universal implying
(without being implied by) the <I>subalternate</I> particular
(&quot;Every X is a Y&quot; implies &quot;Some X is a Y,&quot;
and &quot;No X is a Y&quot; implies &quot;Some X is not a Y&quot;).
 Propositions opposed in both quantity and quality (&quot;Every
X is a Y' and &quot;Some X is not a Y,&quot; and &quot;No X is
a Y&quot; and &quot;Some X is a Y&quot;) are <I>contradictories</I>;
they cannot be jointly true or jointly false -- the truth of a
given proposition implies the falsehood of its contradictory;its
falsehood implies the contradictory's truth.
<P>
   b. Equipolence
<P>
 Closely connected with the theory of opposition is that of the
<I>equipollence</I> of propositions with the same terms in the
same order but with negative particles variously placed within
them.  Since contraictories are true and false under reveresed
conditions, any proposiltion may be equated with the simple denial
of its contradictory.  Thus, &quot;Som X is not a Y&quot; has
the same logical force as &quot;Not every X is a Y,&quot; and
vconversely, &quot;Every X is a Y&quot; has the force of &quot;Not
(some X is not a Y),&quot; or, to give it a more normal English
expression, &quot;Not any X is not a Y&quot;.  Similarly, &quot;Some
X is a Y&quot; has the force of &quot;Not (no X is a Y)&quot;
and &quot;No X is a Y&quot; that of &quot;Not (some X is a Y)&quot;
-- i.e. &quot;Not any X is a Y.&quot;  Also, since &quot;no&quot;
conveys universality and negativeness at once, &quot;No X is a
Y&quot; has the force of &quot;Every X is not-a-Y&quot;, and,
conversely, &quot;Every X is a Y&quot; has the force of &quot;No
X is not-a-Y.&quot;  Writers with an interest in simplification
have seen in these equivalences a means of dispensing with all
but one of the signs &quot;every&quot;, &quot;Some&quot;, and
&quot;no.&quot;  thus the four forms may all be expressed in terms
of &quot;every&quot;, as follows:
<P>
 Every X is a Y (A)
<P>
 Every X is not-a-Y (E)
<P>
 Not every X is not-a-Y (I)
<P>
 Not every X is a Y (O)
<P>
 Of singular propositions all that need be said at this point
is that they divide into affirmatives (&quot;Socarates is mortal,&quot;
&quot;this is a man&quot;, &quot;this man is mortal&quot;) and
negatives (&quot;Socrates is not a mortal,&quot; etc.) and that
when their subject is formed by prefixing &quot;this&quot;to a
common noun (as in &quot;This man is mortal&quot;), the singular
form is implied by the corresponding universal (&quot;Every man
is mortal&quot;) and implies the corresponding particular (&quot;Some
man is mortal&quot;).  Some of the traditional logicians attempted
to assimilate singular propositions to particulars, some to assimilate
them to universals, but these attempts are not very impressive,
and it is one of the few merits of the Renaissance logician Peter
Ramus that he and his followers treated them consistently as a
type of their own.
<P>
   c. Conversion of Propositions
<P>
 With regard to pairs of propositions of the same form and with
the same terms, but in reverse order -- for example &quot;No X
is a Y&quot; and &quot;No Y is an X&quot; -- these are sometimes
equivalent and sometimes not.  Where they are, as in the case
just given, they are said to be converses of one another, and
the forms are said to be convertible.  E and I are convertible;
A and O are not.  
<P>
 That every man is an animal, for example, does not imply that
every animal is a man, and that some animal is not a horse does
not imply that some horse is not an animal.    Conversion, the
inference from a given proposition to its converse (Some men are
liars; therefore, some liars are men), is a type of immediate
inference -- that is, inference involving only one premise (as
opposed, for instance, to syllogisms, which have two).  Other
immediate inferences are those from a given proposition to an
&quot;equipollent&quot; form in the sense of the preceding section
(for example, &quot;Every man is mortal; therefore not any man
is not&quot;) and from a subalternant universal to its subalternate
particular (&quot;Every man is mortal; therefore, some man is
mortal&quot;).
<P>
 The conversion just described is &quot;simple&quot; conversion;
with universals (even A, though it is not &quot;simply&quot; convertible)
there is also a conversion <I>per accidens</I> or <I>subaltern</I>
conversion -- that is, a legitimate inference to the corresponding
particular form with its terms transposed.  Thus, althought &quot;Every
man is an animal&quot; does not impmly that every animal is a
man, it does imply that some animal is.
<P>
 Other forms of immediate inference arise when negative terms
are introduced.  The simultaneous interchange and negation of
subject and predicate is called <I>conversion by contraposition</I>
or simply contrapoisition.  It is a valid process with A's and
O's, not with E's and I's (&quot;Every man is an animal&quot;
immplies &quot;Every non-animal is a non-man&quot; -- whatever
is not an animal is not a man -- and &quot;Not every animal is
a man&quot; implies &quot;Not every non-man is a non-animal,&quot;
but &quot;No horse is a man&quot; does not imply &quot;No non-man
is a non-horse&quot;; &quot;Some X is a Y&quot; is true and &quot;Some
non-Y is a non-X&quot; false if the X's and the Y's overlap and
between them exhaust the universe.)  All of the four forms may
be &quot;obverted&quot; -- that is have their quality changed
and the predicate negated (&quot;Every X is a Y&quot; implies
&quot;No X is a non-Y&quot;, &quot;No X is a Y&quot; implies &quot;Every
X is a non-Y,&quot; and similarly with the particulars).  A variety
of names are given to the results of repeated successive obversion
and conversion.
