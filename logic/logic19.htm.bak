<B>C. Deductive arguments</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
1. Terms
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
A syllogism or argument is made up of a sequence of propositions
(premises followed by a conclusion), such as &quot;All animals
are mortal; all men are animals; therefore all men are mortal.&quot;
Propositions, in turn, are built up from terms -- for example,
&quot;animals&quot;, &quot;mortals&quot;, &quot;men&quot;. The
traditional order of treatment, therefore, begins with the study
of terms (or, in writers with a psychological or epistemological
bias, ideas) and goes on to the study of propositions (or judgments),
concluding with that of syllogisms (or inferences)
<P>
The terms from which the propositions are built up are common
nouns (termini communes), such as &quot;man&quot; and &quot;horse&quot;,
although some attention is also paid to singular terms, such as
&quot;Socrates&quot;, &quot;This man&quot;, and &quot;The man
next door&quot;.
<P>
Much of the traditional theory is devoted to the arrangement of
common nouns in an order of comprehensiveness, and here a distinction
is made between two aspects of their functioning: their &quot;extension&quot;
or denotation and their &quot;intention&quot; or connotation.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
1. Extension (denotation)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The extension or denotation of a common noun is the set of individuals
to which it applies. The dennotation of the term &quot;man&quot;
consists of all objects that possess these attributes. Broadly,
the denotation of a term is its application.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
2. Intention (connotation)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The intention or connotation of a common noun is the set of attributes
which an individual must possess for the common noun to be applicable
to it. Thus, the connotation of the term &quot;man&quot; consists
of the attributes of being an animal, being rational, and perhaps
possessing a certain bodily form. Broadly, the connotation of
a term is its meaning.
<P>
The analysis of the meaning of a term is described as definition.
The breaking up of the set of objects to which it applies into
subsets is described as division. The subsets of the set of individuals
to which a given term applies are called the species of the genus
denoted by the given term. The atgtribute that marks off a particular
species from others of the same genus is called its differentia.
The species is said by scholastic logicisans to &quot;fall under&quot;
its genus, and the standard way of defining a species is by givin
its genus and its differentia.
<P>
The ordering of terms into species and genera is often thought
of as having an upper and a lower limit. the upper limit or <I>summum
genus</I>, will be a broad category like &quot;thing&quot; (<I>substantia</I>)
-- horses are animals, animals are organisms, organisms are bodies,
bodies are things. More abstract terms will come to an end in
more abstract categories, such as &quot;quality&quot; or &quot;relation&quot;
(scarlet is a species or kind of red, red is a color, color is
a quality). The <I>infima species</I>, or lower limit, is a more
difficult concept. Man, for example, is commonly given as an <I>infima
species</I>, but are not men divisible into, for instance, dark-haired
and fair-haired men? This is answered, from the point of view
of intension, by dividing the attributes of an individual into
those that constitute its essence or nature, and those that are
merely accidental, and genuine species are said to be marked off
by &quot;essential&quot; attributes only; further subdivisions
differentiated by &quot;accidental&quot; attributes, such as the
color of a man's hair, are not counted as genuine species. This
distinction is not recognized by some writers. Leibniz counted
all attributes of an individual as essential, so that someone
would not be THAT indivdual if he were in the least respect different
from what he is. At the other extreme, Mill said that &quot;individuals
have no essences,&quot; although he had a use for the term &quot;essence&quot;
in connection with <I>general</I> terms: it is of the essence
of being a man, for example, to be an animal, if being an animal
is one of the attributes commonly employed in fixing the application
of the word &quot;man.&quot;
<P>
An allied doctrine of Mill's is that the proper names of individuals,
by contrast with common nouns, have no connotation, only denotation.
We may not be able to think of a named individual without thinking
of him as having certain attributes, but the purpose of a peroper
name is not to convey the fact that he has those attributes but
only to indentify him as THAT individual. This view has been criticized
by various writers, on the ground, among others, that we cannot
identify an object at all without knowing at least its <I>infima
species</I>. Mill has also been criticized for using the same
term, &quot;denotation&quot;, both for the application of a common
noun and for what is named by a proper name.
<P>
Common terms can be simple or complex.
<P>
Some kinds of complexity are of logical interest -- for example,
the conjuctive combination exemplified by &quot;blind man&quot;
(i.e., what is both blind and human) and the disjuctive combination
exemplified by &quot;man-or-beast&quot;. This kind of complexity
is of interest because, for one thing, it links up with the previous
topic, a blind man being a species (in the borad though not the
narrow sense) of man and a man being a species (again in the broad
sense) of man-or-beast (i.e., of animal). Agains, the term &quot;son-of-Philip&quot;
is compounded of the relative expression &quot;:son of&quot; and
the proper name &quot;Philip,&quot; and this, too, links with
the preceding topic, a son of Philip being a species (in the broad
sense) of son. but the logical behavior of complex terms of these
types is a topic of modern, rather than traditional logic. Even
traditional logic, howerver, has something to say about negative
terms, such as &quot;non-man&quot; (i.e., what is not human),
as will be shown in what follows.
<P>
The distribution of terms is a subject that will be more intelligible
after propositions and syllogisms have been considered.
<P>
<B>2. Propositions</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
a. opposition
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The traditional logic of propositions or judgments is chiefly
concerned with the classification and simpler interrelations of
propositions formed from terms (for example, &quot;No men are
liars&quot;).
<P>
Propositions not compunded of other propositions are called &quot;categorical&quot;.
This word has the force of &quot;unconditional,&quot; the implied
contrast being with forms like &quot;<I>If</I> all that the Bible
says is trure, all men are mortal&quot; or &quot;<I>Either</I>
not all that the Bible says is true, <I>or</I> all men are mortal.&quot;
<P>
Categoricals have a <I>subject term</I> and a <I>predicate term</I>
(&quot;men&quot; is the subject term and &quot;mortal&quot; is
the predicate term of &quot;All men are mortal&quot;) and are
subdivided in two main ways: according to <I>quantity</I>, into
<I>universals</I> (&quot;All men are mortal,&quot; &quot;No men
are mortal&quot;) and <I>particulars</I> (&quot;Some men are mortal,&quot;
&quot;Some men are not mortal&quot;), and according to <I>quality</I>,
into <I>affirmatives</I> (&quot;All men are mortal,&quot; &quot;Some
men are mortal&quot;) and <I>negatives</I> (&quot;No men are mortal,&quot;
&quot;Some men are not mortal&quot;). These are shown as a square,
with universals at the top, particulars at the bottom, affirmatives
on the left and negatives on the right:
<P>
<IMG SRC="squaropo.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">
<P>
Universal affirmatives are called A-propositions, particular affirmatives
I-propositions, universal negatives E-propositions, and particular
negatives )-propositions (the vowels being taken from the words
<I>affirmo</I> and <I>nego</I>). Two other &quot;quantities are
commonly mentioned, namely <I>singular</I> and <I>indefinite</I>.
Singular propositions, such as &quot;Socrates is mortal,&quot;
are a genuinely distinct type, which we shall touch upoon at appropriate
points; indefinites, such as &quot;Men are mortal,&quot; seem
merely to be universals or particulars in which the quantity is
left unstateed. The expressions other than terms which enter into
these forms are called &quot;syncategorematic&quot;; they are
divided into the signs of quantity &quot;all&quot; and &quot;some&quot;
and the copulas &quot;is&quot; or &quot;are&quot; and &quot;is
not&quot; or &quot;are not.&quot; (&quot;No&quot; is both a sighn
of quantity and a sign of negation.)
<P>
These types of propositions -- A, E, I, and O -- are the traditional
&quot;four forms&quot;, and as a preliminary to logical manipulation
it is customary to restate given sentences in some standard way
that will make their quanityt and quality immediately evident.
The forms given above, with &quot;all,&quot; etc., and with plural
common nouns for terms, are the most widely used, but it is in
some ways less misleading to use &quot;every,&quot; etc., and
the terms in the singular -- &quot;Every X is a Y,&quot; &quot;No
X is a Y,&quot; &quot;Some X is a Y,&quot; &quot;Some X is not
a Y.&quot; What is important is to understand that &quot;some&quot;
means simply &quot;at least one&quot;; &quot;Some m,en are mortals&quot;
or &quot;Some man is a mortal&quot; must be understood as neither
affirming nor denying that more than one man is mortal and as
neither affirming nor denying that all men are (i.e., &quot;some&quot;
does NOT mean &quot;only some&quot;).
<P>
A square of the type shown above is called a <I>square of opposition</I>,
and propositions with the same terms in the same order may be
&quot;opposed&quot; in four ways. Universals of opposite quality
(&quot;Every X is a Y,&quot; &quot;No X is a Y&quot;) are said
to be <I>contraries</I>; these cannot be jointly true. Particulars
of opposite quality (&quot;Some X is a Y,&quot; &quot;Some X is
not a Y&quot;) are said to be <I>subcontraries</I>; these cannot
be jointly false. Propositions opposed only in quantity are said
to be <I>subalterns</I>, the <I>subalternant</I> universal implying
(without being implied by) the <I>subalternate</I> particular
(&quot;Every X is a Y&quot; implies &quot;Some X is a Y,&quot;
and &quot;No X is a Y&quot; implies &quot;Some X is not a Y&quot;).
Propositions opposed in both quantity and quality (&quot;Every
X is a Y' and &quot;Some X is not a Y,&quot; and &quot;No X is
a Y&quot; and &quot;Some X is a Y&quot;) are <I>contradictories</I>;
they cannot be jointly true or jointly false -- the truth of a
given proposition implies the falsehood of its contradictory;its
falsehood implies the contradictory's truth.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
b. Equipolence
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Closely connected with the theory of opposition is that of the
<I>equipollence</I> of propositions with the same terms in the
same order but with negative particles variously placed within
them. Since contraictories are true and false under reveresed
conditions, any proposiltion may be equated with the simple denial
of its contradictory. Thus, &quot;Som X is not a Y&quot; has the
same logical force as &quot;Not every X is a Y,&quot; and vconversely,
&quot;Every X is a Y&quot; has the force of &quot;Not (some X
is not a Y),&quot; or, to give it a more normal English expression,
&quot;Not any X is not a Y&quot;. Similarly, &quot;Some X is a
Y&quot; has the force of &quot;Not (no X is a Y)&quot; and &quot;No
X is a Y&quot; that of &quot;Not (some X is a Y)&quot; -- i.e.
&quot;Not any X is a Y.&quot; Also, since &quot;no&quot; conveys
universality and negativeness at once, &quot;No X is a Y&quot;
has the force of &quot;Every X is not-a-Y&quot;, and, conversely,
&quot;Every X is a Y&quot; has the force of &quot;No X is not-a-Y.&quot;
Writers with an interest in simplification have seen in these
equivalences a means of dispensing with all but one of the signs
&quot;every&quot;, &quot;Some&quot;, and &quot;no.&quot; thus
the four forms may all be expressed in terms of &quot;every&quot;,
as follows:
<P>
Every X is a Y (A)
<P>
Every X is not-a-Y (E)
<P>
Not every X is not-a-Y (I)
<P>
Not every X is a Y (O)
<P>
Of singular propositions all that need be said at this point is
that they divide into affirmatives (&quot;Socarates is mortal,&quot;
&quot;this is a man&quot;, &quot;this man is mortal&quot;) and
negatives (&quot;Socrates is not a mortal,&quot; etc.) and that
when their subject is formed by prefixing &quot;this&quot;to a
common noun (as in &quot;This man is mortal&quot;), the singular
form is implied by the corresponding universal (&quot;Every man
is mortal&quot;) and implies the corresponding particular (&quot;Some
man is mortal&quot;). Some of the traditional logicians attempted
to assimilate singular propositions to particulars, some to assimilate
them to universals, but these attempts are not very impressive,
and it is one of the few merits of the Renaissance logician Peter
Ramus that he and his followers treated them consistently as a
type of their own.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
c. Conversion of Propositions
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
With regard to pairs of propositions of the same form and with
the same terms, but in reverse order -- for example &quot;No X
is a Y&quot; and &quot;No Y is an X&quot; -- these are sometimes
equivalent and sometimes not. Where they are, as in the case just
given, they are said to be converses of one another, and the forms
are said to be convertible. E and I are convertible; A and O are
not.
<P>
That every man is an animal, for example, does not imply that
every animal is a man, and that some animal is not a horse does
not imply that some horse is not an animal. Conversion, the inference
from a given proposition to its converse (Some men are liars;
therefore, some liars are men), is a type of immediate inference
-- that is, inference involving only one premise (as opposed,
for instance, to syllogisms, which have two). Other immediate
inferences are those from a given proposition to an &quot;equipollent&quot;
form in the sense of the preceding section (for example, &quot;Every
man is mortal; therefore not any man is not&quot;) and from a
subalternant universal to its subalternate particular (&quot;Every
man is mortal; therefore, some man is mortal&quot;).
<P>
The conversion just described is &quot;simple&quot; conversion;
with universals (even A, though it is not &quot;simply&quot; convertible)
there is also a conversion <I>per accidens</I> or <I>subaltern</I>
conversion -- that is, a legitimate inference to the corresponding
particular form with its terms transposed. Thus, althought &quot;Every
man is an animal&quot; does not impmly that every animal is a
man, it does imply that some animal is.
<P>
Other forms of immediate inference arise when negative terms are
introduced. The simultaneous interchange and negation of subject
and predicate is called <I>conversion by contraposition</I> or
simply contrapoisition. It is a valid process with A's and O's,
not with E's and I's (&quot;Every man is an animal&quot; immplies
&quot;Every non-animal is a non-man&quot; -- whatever is not an
animal is not a man -- and &quot;Not every animal is a man&quot;
implies &quot;Not every non-man is a non-animal,&quot; but &quot;No
horse is a man&quot; does not imply &quot;No non-man is a non-horse&quot;;
&quot;Some X is a Y&quot; is true and &quot;Some non-Y is a non-X&quot;
false if the X's and the Y's overlap and between them exhaust
the universe.) All of the four forms may be &quot;obverted&quot;
-- that is have their quality changed and the predicate negated
(&quot;Every X is a Y&quot; implies &quot;No X is a non-Y&quot;,
&quot;No X is a Y&quot; implies &quot;Every X is a non-Y,&quot;
and similarly with the particulars). A variety of names are given
to the results of repeated successive obversion and conversion.
<P>
<B>3. Syllogisms</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
a. Introduction
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
A categorical syllogism is the inference of one categorical proposition,
the conclusion, from two others, the premises, each premise having
one term in common with the conclusion and one term in common
with the other premises -- for example:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Every animal is mortal;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Every man is an animal;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Therefore, every man is mortal.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The predicate of the conclusion (here, &quot;mortal&quot;) is
called the <I>major</I> term, and the premise which contains it
(here written first) the major premise. The subject of the conclusion
(&quot;man&quot;) is the <I>minor</I> term, and the premise which
contains it (here written second) the minor premise. The term
common to the two premises (&quot;animal&quot;) is the <I>middle</I>
term.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
b. Figures and moods
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Syllogisms are divided into four <I>figures</I>, according to
the placing of the middle term in the two premises.
<P>
In the first figure the middle term is subject in the major premise
and predicate in the minor.
<P>
In the second figure the middle term is predicate in both.
<P>
In the third figure the middle term is subject in both.
<P>
In the fourth figure the middle term is predicate in the major
premise and subject in the minor.
<P>
The following schemata, with <I>P</I> for the major term, <I>S</I>
for the minor, and <I>M</I> for the middle, sum up these distinctions:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Figure 1 Figure 2 Figure 3 Figure 4 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
M - P P - M M - P P - M
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
S - M S - M M - S M - S
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
----- ----- ----- -----
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
S - P S - P S - P S - P
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Within each figure, syllogisms are further divided into <I>moods</I>,
according to the quantity and quality of the propositions they
contain.
<P>
Not all of the theoretically possible combinations of propositions
related as above constitute VALID syllogisms, sequences in which
the third proposition really follows from the other two.
<P>
For example:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Every man is an animal
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Some horse is an animal
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Therefore,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
No man is a horse
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
(mood AIE in figure 2)
<P>
The above is completely inconsequent, even though all three propositions
happen in this case to be true. During the Middle Ages, those
syllogistic moods that are valid acquired certain short names,
with the mood indicated by the vowels, and all of them were put
together in a piece of mnemonic doggerel, of which one of the
later versions is the following:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Barbara, Celarent, Darii, Ferioque <I>prioris</I>;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Cesare, Camestres, Festino, Baroco <I>secundae</I>;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>Tertia</I> Darapti, Disamis, Datisi, Felapton,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Bocardo, Ferison <I>habet. Quarta insuper addit</I> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Bramantip, Camenes, Dimaris, Fesapo, Fresison.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
So, Bocardo, for example, means the mood OAO in figure 3, of which
an illustration would be:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Some patriarch is not mortal;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Every patriarch is a man;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Therefore,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Some man is not mortal.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Without the cute words, the valid moods for each figure are:
<P>
Figure 1
<P>
AAA, EAE, AII, EIO
<P>
Figure 2
<P>
EAE, AEE, EIO, AOO
<P>
Figure 3
<P>
AAI, IAI, AII, EAO, OAO, EIO
<P>
Figure 4
<P>
AAI, AEE, IAI, EAO, EIO
<P>
There is also a group of moods (Barbari and Celaront in Figure
1, Cesaro and Camestrop in Figure 2, and Camenop in Figure 4)
in which a merely particular conclusion is drawn although the
premises would warrant our going further and making the conclusion
universal (the &quot;subaltern&quot; moods). The Ramists added
special moods involving singulars (if we write S and N for affirmative
and negative singulars, we have ASS and ESN in Figure 1, ANN and
ESN in Figure 2 and SSI and NSO in Figure 3).
<P>
It may be noted that every syllogism must have at least one universal
premise, except for SSI and NSO in Figure 3 -- the so-called &quot;expository
syllogisms&quot;. Example:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Enoch is not mortal
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Enoch is a patriarch,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Therefore,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Not every patriarch is mortal.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Moreover, every syllogism must have at least one affirmative premise,
and if either premise is negative or particular, the conclusion
must be negative or particular, as the case may be. &quot;The
conclusion follows the weaker premise&quot;, as Theophratus put
it; negatives and particulars are considered weaker than affirmatives
and universals.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
c. Reduction
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The mnemonic verses serve to indicate how the valid moods of the
later figures may be &quot;reduced&quot; to those of Figure 1
-- that is, how we may derive their conclusions from their premises
without using any syllogistic reasoning of other than the first-figure
type. (This amounts, in modern terms, to proving their validity
from that of the first-figure moods, taken as axiomatic).
<P>
In the second figure mood Cesare, for example, the letter <I>s</I>
after the first <I>e</I> indicates that if we <I>simply convert</I>
the major premise we will have a pair of premises from which we
can deduce the required conclusion in Figure 1, and the initial
letter <I>C</I> indicates that the first-figure mood employed
will be Celarent. An example of a syllogism in Cesare (EAE in
Figure 2) would be:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
No horse is a man;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Every psychopath is a man;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Therefore,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
No pyschopath is a horse.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
This conclusion may eqully be obtained from these premises by
proceeding as follows:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
No horse is a man <I>s</I> No man is a horse;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Every psychopath is a man Every psychopath is a man;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Therefore,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
No psychopath is a horse.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Here the right-hand syllogism, in which the first premise is obtained
from the given major by simple conversion and the second is just
the given minor unaltered, is in the mood Celarent in the first
figure. Festino &quot;reduces&quot; similarly to Ferio and Datisi
and Ferison (in the third figure) reduce to Darii and Ferio, though
in the third figure cases it is the minor premise that must be
simply converted. Darapti and Felapton reduce to Darii and Ferio
by conversion of the minor premise, not simply, but <I>per accidens</I>
(this is indicated by the <I>s</I> of the other moods being changed
to <I>p</I>).
<P>
Camestres (Figure 2) and Disamis (Figure 3) are a little more
complicated. Here we have not only an <I>s</I>, for the simple
conversion of a premise, but also an <I>m</I>, indicated that
the premises must be transposed, and a further s at the end because
the transposed premises yield, in Figure 1, not the required condlusion
but rather its converse, from which the required conclusion must
be obtained by a further conversion at the end of the process.
An example of Disamis would be the following:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Some men are liars;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
All men are automata;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Therefore,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Some automata are liars.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
If we convert the major premise and transpose the two, we obtain
the new pair:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
All men are automata;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Some liars are men.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
From these we may obtain in the first-figure mood Darii not immediately
the conclusion &quot;Some automata are liars&quot; but rather,
&quot;Some liars are automata,&quot; from which, however, &quot;some
automata are liars&quot; does follow by simple conversion.
<P>
Baroco and Bocardo are different again. In both of them neither
premise is capable of simple conversion, and if we convert the
A premises per accidens we obtain pairs IO and OI, and there are
no valid first-figure moods with such premises -- in fact, no
valid moods at all with two particular premises. We therefore
show that the conclusion follows from the premises by the device
called <I>reductio ad absurdum</I>. That is, we assume for the
sake of argument that the conclusion does NOT follow from the
premises -- i.e., that the premises can be true and the conclusion
false -- and from this assumption, using first figure reasoing
alone, we deduce impossible consequences. The assumption, therefore,
cannot stand, so the conclusion does after all follow from its
premises.
<P>
Take, for example, the following syllogism in Baroco (AOO in Figure
2):
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Every man is mortal;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Some patriarch (viz., Enoch) is not mortal;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Therefore,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Some patriarch is not a man.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Suppose the premises are true and the conclusion is not true.
Then we have:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
1) Every man is mortal;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
2) Some patriarch is not mortal;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
3) Every patriarch is a man.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
This is contradictory of the conclusion. But from 1) and 3), in
the first-figure mood Barbara, we may infer
<BLOCKQUOTE>
4) Every patriarch is mortal.

<P>
However, the combination of 2) and 4) is impossible. Hence, we
can have both 1) and 2) only if we drop 3) -- that is, if we accept
the conclusion of the given second-figure syllogism.
<P>
It is possible to &quot;reduce&quot; all the second figure and
third-figure moods to Figure 1 by this last method, and although
this procedure is a little complicated, it brings out better than
the other reductions the essential character of second-figure
and third-figure reasoning. Figure 1 is governed by what is called
the <I>dictum de omni et nullo</I>, the principle that what applies
to all or none of the objects in a given class will apply or not
apply (as the case may be) to any member or subclass of this class.
As Kant preferred to put it, first-figure reasoning expresses
the <I>subsumption</I> of <I>cases</I> under a <I>rule</I> --
the major premise states some affirmative or negative rule (&quot;Every
man is mortal&quot;, &quot;No man will live forever&quot;), the
minor asserts that something is a case or some things are cases,
to which this rule applies (&quot;Enoch and Elijah are men&quot;),
and the conclusion states the result of applying the rule to the
given case or cases (&quot;Enoch and Elijah are mortal,&quot;
&quot;Enoch and Elijah will not live forever&quot;). Hence, in
Figure 1 the mjor premise is always universal (that being how
rules are expressed) and the minor affirmative (&quot;Something
IS a case&quot;).
<P>
Second-figure reasoning also begins with the statement of a rule
(&quot;Every man is mortal&quot;) but in the minor premise DENIES
that we have with a given example the result which the rule prescribes
(&quot;Enoch and Elijah are NOT mortal,&quot; &quot;Enoch and
Elijah WILL live forever&quot;) and concludes that we do NOT have
a case to which the rule applies (&quot;Enoch and Elijah cannot
be men&quot;). It combines, in effect, the first-figure major
with the contradictory of the first figure conclusion to obtain
the contradictory of the first-figure minor (compare the &quot;reduction&quot;
of Baroco). A second-figure syullogism, in consequence, must have
a universal major, premises opposed in quality, and a negative
conclusion. Its practical uses are in refuting hypotheses, as
in medicine or detection (&quot;Whowever has measles has spots,
and thich child has no spots, so he does not have measles&quot;;
&quot;Whoever killed X was a person of great strength and Y is
not such a person, so Y did not kill X&quot;).
<P>
In the third figure we begin by asserting that something or other
does not exhibit the result which a proposed rule would give (&quot;Enoch
and Elijah are NOT mortal,&quot; &quot;Enoch and Elijah WILL live
forever&quot;), go on to say that we nevertheless DO have here
a case or cases to which the rule would apply if true (&quot;Enoch
and Elijah ARE mn&quot;), and conlcude that the rule is not true
(&quot;Not all men are mortal,&quot; &quot;Some men do live forever&quot;).
A third-figure syllogism, consequently, has an affirmative minor
(the thing IS a case) and a particular conclusion (the contradictory
of a universal being a particular); its use is to confute rashly
assumed rules, such as proposed scientific laws.
<P>
This rather neat system of interrelations (first clearly brought
out by C.S. Peirce) concerns ONLY the first three figures; it
was not until the later Middle Ages, in fact, that a distict fourth
figure was recognized. The common division of figures assumes
that we are considering completed syllogisms, with the conclusion
(and its subject and predicate) already before us; however, the
question Aristotle originally put to himself was not &quot;Which
completed syllogisms are valid?&quot; but &quot;Which pairs of
premises will yield a syllogistic conclusion?&quot;
<P>
Starting at this end, we cannot distinguish major and minor premises
as those containing, respectively, the predicate and subject of
the conclusion. Artistotle distinguished them, in the first figure,
by their comparative comprehensiveness and mentioned what we now
call the fourth-figure moods as ood cases in which first-figure
premises will yield a conclusion wherein the &quot;minor&quot;
term is predicated of the &quot;major&quot;. Earlier versions
of the mnemonic lines accordingly list the fourth-figure moods
with the first-figure ones and (since the premises are thought
of as being in the first figure order) give them slightly different
names (Baralipton, Celantes, Dabitis, Fapesmo, Frisesomorum).
<BLOCKQUOTE>
d. Distribution of Terms
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Terms may occur in A-, E- , I- , and O-propostions as <I>distributed</I>
or as <I>undistributed</I>. The rule is that universals distribute
their subjects and particulars distribute their predicates, but
what this means is seldom very satisfactorily explained.
<P>
It is often said, for example, that a distributed term refers
to all, and an undistributed term to only a part, of its extension.
BGut in what way does &quot;Some men are mortal,&quot; for example,
refer to only a part of the class of men? Any man whatever will
do to verify it; if any man whatever turns out to be mortal, &quot;Some
men are mortal&quot; is true. What the traditional writers were
trying to express seems to be something of the following sort:
a term <I>t</I> is distributed in a proposition <I>f(t)</I> if
and only if it is replaceable in <I>f(t)</I>, without loss of
truth, by any term &quot;falling under it&quot; in the way that
a species falls under a genus. Thus, &quot;man&quot; is distributed
in:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Every man is an animal;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
No man is a horse;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
No horse is a man;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Some animal is not a man.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Why? Because these respectively imply, say,
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Every blind man is an animal;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
No blind man is a horse;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
No horse is a blind man;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Some animal is not a blind man.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
On the other hand, it is undistributed in:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Some man is keen-sighted;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Some man is not disabled;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Every Frenchman is a man;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Some keen-sighted animal is a man,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
since these do NOT respectively imply
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Some blind man is keen-sighted;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Some blind man is not disabled;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Every Frenchman is a blind man;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Some keen-sighted animal is a blind man.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
In this sense A- and E-propositions do distribute their subjects
and E- and O-propositions their predicates. John Anderson pointed
out that the four positive results above may be established syllogistically,
given that all the members of a speices (using the term widely)
are members of its genus -- in the given case, that all blind
men are men. From &quot;Every man is an animal&quot; and &quot;Every
blind man is a man&quot;, Every blind man is an animal&quot; follows
in Barbara; with the second example the syllogism is in Celarent,
with the third in Camestres, with the fourth in Baroco. Note,
however, that the mere prefixing of &quot;every&quot; to a term
is not in itself sufficient to secure its &quot;distribution&quot;
in the above sense; for example &quot;man&quot; is not distributed
in &quot;Not every man is disabled,&quot; since this does not
imply &quot;Not every blind man is disabled.&quot;
<P>
For a syllogism to be valid the middle term must be distributed
at least once, and any term distributed in the conclusion must
be distributed in its premise (although there is no harm in a
term's being distributed in its premise but not in the conclusion).
Many syllogisms can quickly be shown to be fallacious by the applications
of these rules.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Every man is an animal;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Every horse is an animal;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Therefore,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Every horse is a man.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The above syllogism fails to distribute the middle term &quot;animal,&quot;
and it is clear that any second figure syllogism with two affirmative
premises would have the same fault (since in the second figure
the middle term is predicate twiche, and affirmatives do not distribute
their predicates).
<P>
Oteher special rules for the different figures, such as that in
Figures 1 and 3, the minor premise must be affirmative, can be
similarly proved from the rules of distribution together with
the rules of quality (that a valid syllogism does not have two
negative premises and that a conclusion is negative if and only
if one premise is). Logicians have endeavored to prove some of
these rules from others and to reduce the number of unproved rules
to a minimum.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
e. Euler's diagrams
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
One device for checking the validity of syllogistic inferences
is the use of certain diagrams attributed to the seventeenth-centruy
mathematician Leonhard Euler, although their accurate employment
seems to date rather from J.D. Gergonne, in the early nineteenth
century.
<P>
From the traditional laws of opposition and conversion it can
be shown that the extensions of any pair of terms X, Y will be
related in one or another of five ways:
<P>
Alpha: every X is a Y and every Y is an X. That is, their extensions
coincide
<P>
Beta: every X is a Y, but not every Y is an X. That is, the X's
form a proper part of the Y's.
<P>
Gamma: every Y is an X, but not every X is a Y. That is, the Y's
form a proper part of the X's.
<P>
Delta: Some, but not all, X's are Y's and some, but not all Y's
are X's. That is, the X's and Y's overlap.
<P>
Epsilon: No X's are Y's and so no Y's are X's. That is, the Sy's
and Y's are mutually exclusive.
<P>
<IMG SRC="euler1.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">
<P>
&quot;Every X is a Y&quot; (A) is true if and only if we have
either Alpha or Beta.
<P>
&quot;Some X is not a Y&quot; (O) if and only if we have either
Gamma or Delta or Epsilon.
<P>
&quot;No X is a Y&quot; (E) if and only if we have Epsilon.
<P>
&quot;Some X is a Y&quot; (I) if and only if we have either Alpha
or Beta or Gamma or Delta.
<P>
From these facts it follows that A andO are in no case true together
and in no case false together, and similarly for E and I; that
I si true in every case in which A is and also in two cases in
which A is not, and similarly for O and E; that A and E are in
no case true togethert but in two cases are both false; and that
O and I are in no case both fasle but in two cases are both true.
After working out analogous truth conditions for the forms with
reversed terms, we will see that they are the same for the two
I's and the two E's (showing that these are simply convertible)
but not for th two A's and the two O's (showing that these are
not).
<P>
Given which of the five relations holds between X and Y and which
between Y and Z, we can work out by compounding diagrams what
will be the possible relations between X and Z. For example, if
we know that every X is a Y and every Y a Z, then we must have
either (Alpha)XY and (Alpha)YZ or (Alpha)XY and (Beta)YZ or (Beta)XY
and (Alpha)YZ or (Beta)XY and (Beta)Yz; that is we must have:
<P>
<IMG SRC="euler2.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">
<P>
Inspection will show that for X and Z we have in every case either
<P>
<IMG SRC="euler3.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">
<P>
so in every case every X is Z. Hence, Barbara is valid.
<P>
When employing this procedure it is essential to consider all
the possible cases involved. Barbara is not validated, for example,
by donsidering case (iv) alone, as popular expositions of this
method sometimes suggest.
<P>
f. Polysyllogisms, enthymemes, and induction
<P>
1) Polysyllogisms
<P>
In an extended argument the conclusion of one inference may be
used as a premise of another, and the conclusion of that as premise
of a third, and so on. In presenting such an argument we may simply
omit the intermediate steps and list all the premises together.
<P>
For example, the sequence of categorical syllogisms:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Every X is a Y
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Every Y is a Z
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Therefore
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Every X is a Z
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Every Z is a T
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Therefore
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Every X is a T
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
may be condensed to
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Every X is a Y
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Every Y is a Z
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Every Z is a T
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Therefore
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Every X is a T
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Such a condensed chain of syllogisms is called a polysyllogism
or sorites.
<P>
The theory of chains of two syllogisms was thoroughly studied
by Galen, as reported in an ancient passage recently unearthed
by Jan Lukasiewicz. Galen showed that the only combinations of
the Aristotelian three figrues that could be thus used were 1
and 1, 1 and 2, and 1 and 3, and 2 and 3. His discovery of these
four types of compound syllogism was misunderstood by later writers
as an anticipation of the view that SINGLE syllogisms may be of
four figures.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
2) Enthymemes
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Even when it is not a conclusion from other premises already stated,
one of the premises of an inference may often be informally omitted
(for example:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Enoch and Elijah are men,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Therefore
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Enoch and Elijah are mortals.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Such a truncated inference is often called an enthymeme. This
is not Aristotle's own use of the term, though he did mention
that a premise is often omitted in the statement of an enthymeme
in his sense. An Aristotelian enthymeme is a merely probable argument
-- this is, one in which the conclusion does not strictly follow
from the premises but is merely made more likely by them. When
the claim made for an argument is thus reduced, the normal rules
may be relaxed in certain directions; in particular, the second
and third figures may be used to yield more than merely negative
results. Thus Figure 2 may be used not only to prove that something
is not a case falling under a given rule but also to suggest that
it is one --to use a modern example:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Any collection of particles whose movement is accelerated will
occupy more space that it did;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
A heated gase will occupy more space than it did;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Therefore:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
A heated gas may be a collection of particles whose movement is
accelerated.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Figure 3 may be similarly used not only to prove that some rule
does not hold universally but also to suggest that it does hold
universally -- for instance:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
X,Y,Z are all of them white;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
X,Y,Z are all of them snowflakes;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Therefore, perhaps all snowflakes are white.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
If the second premise here is strengthened to &quot;X,Y,Z are
all the snowflakes there are&quot;, the conclusion will follow
without any &quot;perhaps&quot; (of course, the new premise in
this case is a false one, and the conclusion is also false). The
form of inference:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
X,Y,Z, etc., are all of the P's;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
X,Y,Z, etc., are all the S's there are;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Therefore all S's are P's
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
was called by Aristotle &quot;induction&quot;; more accurately,
he used this term for a similar passage from all the subspecies
to their genus (&quot;The X's the Y's and the Z's are all of the
P's and are all the S's; therefore...&quot;). He observed that
the &quot;conversion&quot; of the second premise to &quot;All
the S's are the X's, the Y's, and the Z's&quot; will turn such
an induction into a syllogism in Barbara.
<P>
The term &quot;induction&quot; being extended in the more recent
tradition to cover the merely probable inference given just previously,
we distinguish Aristotelian induction by calling it &quot;formal&quot;
or &quot;perfect&quot; induction or (as W.E. Johnson called it)
&quot;summary&quot; induction. The Figure 2 type of merely probable
inference is one of the things meant by the term &quot;argument
from&quot; -- or &quot;by&quot; -- &quot;analogy&quot; (or just
&quot;analogy&quot;). C.S. Peirce called it &quot;hypothesis&quot;.
<P>
<B>Summary</B> 
<P>
The nineteen fundamental types of logical arguments have been
given names to make them easier to remember. As a further memory
aid, they have been incorporated into a Latin verse:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Barbara, Celarent, Darii, Ferioque, prioris;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Cesare, Camestres, Festino, Baroco, secundae;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

habet;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Quaera insuper addit Bramantip, Camenes, Dimaris, Fesapo, Fresison.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
It should be noted that when dealing with <I>Darapti, Felapton,
Bramantip</I> and <I>Fesapo</I>, we must examine the question
of <I>existential import</I> before deciding the validity or invalidity
of the syllogism in question.
<P>
Rule One: A valid standard-form categorical syllogism must contain
exactly three terms, each of which is used in the same sense throughout
the argument.
<P>
Rule Two: In a valid standard-form categorical syllogism, the
middle term must be distributed in at least one premise.
<P>
Rule Three: In a valid standard-form categorical syllogism, if
either term is distributed in the conclusion, then it must be
distributed in the premises.
<P>
Rule Four: No standard-form categorical syllogism is valid which
has two negative premises.
<P>
Rule Five: If either premise of a valid standard-form categorical
syllogism is negative, the conclusion must be negative.
<P>
Rule Six: No valid standard-form categorical syllogism with a
particular conclusion can have two universal premises.
<P>
Rule Seven: From two premises beginning with &quot;some&quot;,
no conclusion can be drawn.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
g. Skeptical criticism of syllogistic reasoning
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
In the latter part of the nineteenth century, under the influence
of J.S. Mill, textbooks of the traditional type came to have two
main divisions, &quot;formal&quot; or &quot;deductive&quot; logic
(dealt with more or less as above) and &quot;inductive&quot; logic
or &quot;scientific method&quot;. With the details of inductive
logic we are not concerned here, but we may glance at the view
of some writers that merely probable induction and analogy are
the only genuine types of reasoning, &quot;formal&quot; or syllogistic
reasoning being useless or spurious because it is inevitably circular,
assuming in the premises what it sets out to prove as the conclusion.
<P>
The second-century skeptic Sextus Empiricus suggested that, in
the syllogism
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Every man is an animal
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Socrates is a man
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
therefore
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Socrates is an animal
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
the only way to establish the major premise is by induction. However,
if the induction is incomplete the examination of a new instance
-- e.g. of Socrates -- might prove it false, and if it is complete
the conclusion (&quot;Socrates is an animal&quot;) must already
have been used in establishing it. This argument was repeated
by such writers as George Campbell, in the eighteenth century,
who supplemented it with another, to cover the case in which the
major is established not by induction but simply by definition
or linguistic convention:
<P>
&quot;Of course every man is an animal, for bein an animal is
part of what we mean by being a man.&quot; In this case it is
the minor premise, &quot;Socrates is a man,&quot; that cannot
be established without first establishing the conclusion (that
he is an animal). The same point was urged by another Scottish
philosopher, Thomas Brown. It is allied to an argument used by
Sextus to show not that syllogism is circular but that the major
premise is superfluous. If, he said, every man is an animal because
it FOLLOWS from an object's being a man that it is an animal,
then the allegedly enthymematic &quot;Socrates is a man; therefore,
Socrates is an animal&quot; must be valid as it stands.
<P>
Richard Whately, answering Campbell's arguments in the early nineteenth
century, complained that Campbell had confined himself to examples
in which the syllogistic argument was indeed superfluous and countered
them with some in which it was not -- for example, the case of
some laborers, ignorant of the fact that all horned animals are
ruminant, digging up a skeleton whicch they, but not a distant
naturalist, coulsd see to be horned, the laaborers and the naturalist
thus separately providing premises which were both required to
obtain the conclusion that the skeleton was of a ruminant animal.
Whately admitted that the sense in which we may make a &quot;discovery&quot;
by drawing a syllogistic conclusion is different from that in
which we make a discovery by observation, but it can be a genuine
discovery none the less; there are &quot;logical&quot; as well
as &quot;physical&quot; discoveries.
<P>
After Whately, J.S. Mill took up the argument, but it is not entirely
clear what side he was on. Sometimes he treated a universal major
as already asserting, among other things, the conclusion:
<P>
Whoever pronounces the words, All men are mortal, has affirmed
that Socrates is mortal, though he may never have heard of Socrates;
for since Socrates, whether known to be so or not, really is a
man, he is included in the words, All men, and in every assertion
of which they are the subject (<I>System of Logic</I>, Book II,
Ch. 3, p. 8, note) <BR>

<P>
&quot;Included in the <I>meaning</I> of the words,&quot; he must
have meant (for it is obvious that neither Socrates the man nor
&quot;Socrates&quot;, his name, forms any part of the words &quot;All
men&quot;), but this contradicts Mill's own insistence that the
meaning of general terms like &quot;men&quot; lies wholly in their
&quot;connotation&quot; and that &quot;All men are mortal&quot;
means that wherever the <I>attributes</I> of humanity are present,
mortality is present, too. He rightly chided Brown, who thought
that the meaning of &quot;Socrates is mortal&quot; (like that
of &quot;Socrates is an animal&quot;) is already contained in
the minor premise &quot;Socrates is a man,&quot; for failing to
distinguish the actual connotation of &quot;man&quot; (i.e., the
attributes by which its application is determined) from other
attributes (such as mortality) which we may empirically discover
these to be attended with, but his own view in the passage cited
is similarly negligent. <BR>
Mill's main point, however, is different and more defensible.
When careful and extensive observation warrants the conclusion
that, say, all men are mortal, and we then observe that the duke
of Wellingtonis a man and conclude that he is therefore mortal,
we have in effect an induction followed by a syllogism. Mill pointed
out that if this procedure is justified at all, the introduction
of the syllogistic major is superfluous. For if the original body
of evidence really does warrant the inference that all men are
mortal, it is certainly sufficient to warrant the inference that
the duke of Wellington is mortal, given that he is a man. In other
words, if we really are justified in the move from particular
observations to the general proposition, and from there to new
particulars, we would be equally justified in moving directly
&quot;from particulars to particulars.&quot; What the syllogistic
major does, Mill argued, is simply to sum up in a single formula
the entire class of inferences to new particulars which the evidence
warrants. That is, &quot;All men are mortal&quot; means, in effect,
that if we ever find anyone to be a man we are justified in inferring,
from the observations we have previously amassed, that he is mortal.
&quot;The conclulsion is not an inference drawn <I>from</I> the
formula&quot; --i.e., from &quot;All men are mortal&quot; thus
understood -- &quot;but an inference drawn <I>according to</I>
the formula (ibid., p. 4). Mill here anticipated Gilbert Ryle's
treatment of &quot;lawlike statements&quot; as &quot;inference
licenses&quot; and echoed Sextus' point that it is inconsistent
to require that such licenses be added to the premises of the
inferences they permit, since what they license is precisely the
drawing of the conclusion from <I>those</I> premises. <BR>

<P>
Mill in fact here shifted the discussion from Sextus' first skeptical
&quot;topic&quot; to his second -- from the charge of circularity
to the question of what distinguishes a rule of inference from
a premise. On this point more was said later in the nineteenth
century by C.S. Peirce. Peirce, like Mill, distinguished sharply
between the premise or premises from which, and the &quot;leading
principle&quot; according to which, a conclusion is drawn. He
also noted, as did Mill, that what is traditionally counted as
a premise may function in practice as a &quot;leading principle&quot;.
But it need not, and, indeed what is traditionally counted as
a &quot;leading principle&quot; (say the <I>dictum de omni et
nullo</I> may sometimes be, conversely, treated in practice as
a premise. Certainly, since <I>all men are mortal</I> (leading
principle 1), we are justified in inferrint the mortality of Socrates
(or the duke of Wellington, or Elijah) from his humainty. But
equally, since <I>all members of any class are also members of
any class that contains the former as a subclass</I> (leading
principle 2), we are justified in inferring the mortality of Socrates
from his being a man AND from men's being a subclass of mortals.
For the very same reason (that all members of any class are also
members of any class that contains the former as a subclass) we
are justified in infering the mortality of Socrates from his being
a member of a subclass of the class of mortals AND from the membership
of any member of a class in all classes of which it is a subclass.
In this last example we have one and the same proposition functioning
as a premise and as a leading principle in the same inference
(not mmerely, like &quot;All men are mortal&quot; in the preceding
two examples, as a leading principle in one and a premise in another);
to be capable of this, Peirce thought, is the mark of a &quot;logical&quot;
leading principle. <BR>

<P>
It is not certain that Peirce's method of distinguishing &quot;logical&quot;
from other sorts of &quot;leading principles&quot; will bear inspection.
However, he seems to have established his basic point, that what
it would be fatal to require in all cases -- the treatment of
a leading principle as a premise -- we may safely permit in some.
There may be useful and valid reasoning about subjects of all
degrees of abstraction, including logic itself.

h. Hypothetical and disjunctive syllogisms 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Traditional textbooks, aside from developing the theory of categorical
propositions and syllogisms, have a brief appendix mentioning
&quot;hypothetical&quot; (or &quot;conditional&quot;) and &quot;disjunctive&quot;
propositions and certain &quot;syllogisms&quot; to which they
give rise. <BR>
&quot;Hypothetical&quot; syllogisms are divided into &quot;pure&quot;,
in which premises and conclusion are all of the form &quot;If
<I>p</I> then <I>q</I>, and if <I>q</I> then <I>r</I>; therefore,
if <I>p</I> then <I>r</I>,&quot; analogous to Barbara) <BR>
And &quot;mixed&quot; in which only one premise is hypothetical
and the other premise and the conclusion are categorical. The
mixed hypothetical syllogism has two valid &quot;moods&quot;:
<BR>

<P>
1. Modus ponendo ponens: <BR>
If p then q, and p; therefore, q.<BR>
2. Modus ponendo tollens: <BR>
If p then q, but not p; therefore, not q. <BR>

<P>
In both these moods the hypothetical premise is called the major,
the categorical the minor. <I>Ponere</I>, in the mood names, means
to affirm, <I>tollere</I> to deny. In (1), by afffirming the antecedent
of the hypothetical we are led to affirm its consequent; in (2),
by denying its consequent we are led to deny its antecedent. The
fallacies of &quot;affirming the consequent&quot; and &quot;denying
the antecedent&quot; (i.e., of doing these things <I>to start
with</I>, in the minor premise) consist in reversing these procedures
-- that is, in arguing &quot;If <I>p</I> then <I>q</I>, and <I>q</I>;
therefore, <I>p</I>&quot; and &quot;If <I>p</I> then <I>q</I>,
but not <I>q</I>; therefore, not <I>p</I>.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Disjunctive&quot; syllogisms -- i.e., ones involving &quot;Either-or&quot;
propositions -- have the following two &quot;mixed&quot; moods.
<BR>

<P>
3. Modus tollendo ponens: <BR>
Either <I>p</I> or <I>q</I>, but not <I>p</I>; <BR>
therefore, <I>q</I> (or, butn not <I>q</I>; therefore <I>p</I>).
<BR>

<P>
4. Modus ponendo tollens: <BR>
Either <I>p</I> or <I>q</I>, and <I>p</I>; <BR>
therefore, not <I>q</I> (or, and <I>q</I>; therefore, not <I>p</I>).
<BR>
Mood (4) is valid only if &quot;Either <I>p</I> or <I>q</I> is
interpreted &quot;exclusively&quot; -- i.e., as meaning &quot;Either
<I>p</I> or <I>q</I> but not both&quot; -- whereas (3) is valid
even if it is interpreted as &quot;Either <I>p</I> or <I>q</I>
or both.&quot; There is also a <I>modus tollendo ponens</I> with
the simple &quot;Not both <I>p</I> and <I>q</I>&quot; as major
and the rest as in (4).<BR>
<BR>
i. Dilemmas <BR>
Hypothetical and disjunctive premises may combine to yield a categorical
conclusion in the <I>dilemma</I>, or &quot;horned&quot; syllogism
(<I>syllogismus cornutus</I>, with its two forms:<BR>

<P>
5. Constructive: <BR>
If <I>p</I> then <I>r</I>, and if <I>q</I> then <I>r</I>, but
either <I>p</I> or <I>q</I>; therefore, <I>r</I>.<BR>

<P>
6. Destructive: <BR>
If <I>p</I> then <I>q</I>, and if <I>p</I> then <I>r</I>, but
either not <I>q</I> or not <I>r</I>; therefore, not <I>p</I>.
<BR>
These basic forms have a number of variations; for instance, <I>q</I>
in (5) may be simply &quot;not <I>p,</I>&quot; making the disjunctive
premise the logical truism &quot;Either <I>p</I> or not <I>p</I>&quot;;
or <I>p</I> may imply <I>r</I> and <I>q</I> imply <I>s</I>, giving
as conclusion &quot;Either <I>r</I> or <I>s</I>&quot; rather than
the categorical <I>r</I>; or the disjunctive premise may be conditionalized
to &quot;If <I>s</I> then either <I>p</I> or <I>q</I>,&quot; making
the conclusion &quot;If <I>s</I> then <I>r</I>.&quot; <BR>
A typical dilemma is that put by Protagoras to Euathlus, whom
he had trained as a lawyer on the understanding that he would
be paid a fee as soon as his pupil won a case. When the pupil
simply engaged in no litigation at all, Protagoras sued him for
the fee. His argument was &quot;If Euathlus wins this case, he
must pay my fee by our agreement, and if he loses it he must pay
it by the judge's decision (for that is what losing this case
would mean), but he must either win or lose the case; therefore,
in either case he must pay.&quot; <BR>

<P>
&quot;Escaping betweenthe horns&quot; of a dilemma is denying
the disjunctive premise; for example, Euathlus might have argued
that he would neither win nor lose the case if the judge refused
to make any decision. &quot;Taking a dilemma by the horns&quot;
is admitting the disjunction but denying one of the implications,
as Euathlus might have done by arguing that if he won he would
still not be bound by the agreement to pay Protagoras, because
this was not the sort of case intended in the agreement. &quot;Rebutting&quot;
a dilemma is constructing another dilemma drawing upon the same
body of facts but leading to an opposite conclusion. This is what
Euathlus did, arguing that if he won the case he would be dispensed
from paying by the judge's decision, and if he lost it the agreement
would dispense him, so either way he was dispensed from paying.
Rebuttal, however, is possible only if one of the other moves
(though it may not be clear which) is also possible, for a single
set of prremises can lead by equally valid arguments to contradictroy
conclusions only if they contain some fault in themselves. <BR>

<P>
Dilemmatic reasoning obtains a categorical conclusion from hypothetical
and disjuctive premises; the Port-Royalists pointed out that we
may also obtain hypothetical conclusions from categorical premises.
For in any categorical syllogism we may pass directly from one
of the premises to the conclusion stated not categorically but
conditionally on the truth of the other premise; for instance,
from &quot;Every man is mortal&quot; we may infer that IF Socrates
is a man he is mortal, and from &quot;Socrates is a man&quot;
that if every man is mortal Socrates is, and similarly with all
other syllogisms. This &quot;rule of conditionalization&quot;
is much used in certain modern logical systems.
