<b> E. Logical fallacies</b>  <BR>
1. Fallacies of relevance   <BR>
a. Argumentum ad baculum <BR>
An argument that resorts to the threat of force to cause the acceptance
of the conclusion.  They may also include threats of fear to cause
acceptance. <BR>
Examples: <BR>
Do this or you'll die! <BR>
Might makes right <BR>
If you don't practice the piano, I'll put you in time out.   
<BR>
b. Argumentum ad hominem <BR>
An argument that attempts to disprove the truth of what is asserted
by attacking the speaker rather than the speaker's argument. 
Another way of putting it:  fallacy where you attack someone's
character instead of dealing with salient issues.  There are two
basic types of ad hominem arguments: 1) abusive and 2) circumstantial.
<BR>
<B>abusive</B>: the person is attacked over what he said <BR>
example: <BR>
Arguing with Hitler over whether the sun is shining, just because
it's Hitler. <BR>
<B>circumstantial</B>: attacking the circumstances the person
is in <BR>
example: <BR>
Don't listen to the congressman; he's pro-union.   <BR>
c. Argumentum ad ignorantium <BR>
An argument that a propisition is true because it has not been
shown to be false, or vice versa.  Ad ignorantium arguments are
also known as &quot;appeals to ignorance&quot;.  This fallacy
has two forms: <BR>
1. P is true, because it has not been proven false. <BR>
2. P is false, because it has not been proven true. <BR>
Inability to refute is taken as demonstration of their views.
 This is a common tactic with crackpots and conspiracy theorists.
<BR>
Examples: <BR>
We have here the names of members of the state department that
are under a cloud of suspician.  While we have no evidence that
they are members of the communist party, we do not have evidence
that they are not. <BR>
   <BR>
d. Argumentum ad misericordiam <BR>
An argument that appeals to pity for the sake of getting a conclusion
accepted. <BR>
Example: <BR>
Look at that poor man; doesn't your heart blead for the suffering
he has endured.  How can you not grant him a sizeable judgment
in this case.   <BR>
e. Argumentum ad populum <BR>
An argument that appeals to the beliefs of the multitude (i.e.,
the populous).  Another way of putting it: speaker deals with
passions of audience rather than with alient issues.  This fallacy
is also known as &quot;appeal to tradition&quot;.  Ad populum
arguments often occur in 1) propaganda 2) demagoguery, and 3)
advertizing. <BR>
Examples: <BR>
1. 56 percent of the American public believes this. <BR>
2. The majority of experts hold this position. <BR>
3. Four out of five dentists agree... <BR>
4. Millions can't be wrong... <BR>
5. But we've always done it that way...   <BR>
f. Argumentum ad verecundiam <BR>
An argument in which an authority is appealed to.  Ad verecundiam
refers to a fallacy of simply resorting to appeals to authority.
 Again, very common in advertizing. <BR>
Examples: <BR>
1. Drink this soda because this famous athlete drinks it. <BR>
2. Vote this way because this famous actor will vote this way.
<BR>
3. Believe this because this famous pastor (teacher) belives this.
  <BR>
g. Accident <BR>
Come out of generalizations and down to specific case.  Also called
a Sweeping Generalization or Dicto Simpliciter.  It occurs when
a general rule is applied to a particular situation in which the
features of that particular situation render the rule inapplicable.
 It is the opposite of converse accident (also call hasty generalization).
  <BR>
h. Converse accident <BR>
Hasty generalization.  An argument in which a proposition is used
as a premise without attention given to some obvious condition
that would affect the proposition's application. It is a fallacy
that takes evidence from several, possibly unrepresentative, cases
to a general rule; generalizing from few to many.  Note the relation
to statistics: much of statistics concerns whether or not a sample
is representative of a larger population.  The larger the sample
size, the better the representativeness.  Note also that the opposite
of a hasty generalization is a sweeping generalization. <BR>
Example: <BR>
My neighbors on both side of me have won the lottery, so we should
play the lottery.   <BR>
i. False cause    <BR>
1) non causa pro causa <BR>
An argument to reject a proposition because of the falsity of
some other proposition that seems to be a consequence of the first,
but really is not. <BR>
Example: <BR>
We should eat vegitables because animals eat them and are healthy.
<BR>
    <BR>
2) post hoc ergo propter hoc <BR>
An argument from a premise of the form &quot;A preceded B&quot;
to a conclusion of the form &quot;A caused B&quot;.  Simply because
one event precedes another event in time deos not mean that the
first event is the cause of the second event.  This argument resembles
the fallacy known as Hasty Generalization.    <BR>
3) cum hoc ergo propter hoc <BR>
A fallacy of correlation that links events because they occur
simultaneously; one asserts that because two events occur together
they are causally related, and leaves no room for other factors
that may be the cause(s) of the events.  This fallacy is similar
to the &quot;post hoc&quot; fallacy.   <BR>
j. petitio princippi <BR>
Same as &quot;begging the question&quot;.  The argument assumes
its conclusion is true but DOES NOT SHOW it to be true.  Petitio
principii has two forms: <BR>
1) P is true, because P is true. <BR>
2) P is true, because A is true.  And A is true because B is true.
 And B is true because P is true. <BR>
Also called circular reasoning.   <BR>
k. Complex question <BR>
Hidden within the question is another question.  This is also
called Fallacy of Interrogation.  The question asked has a presupposition
which the answerer may wish to deny, but which he/she would be
accepting if he/she gave anything that would count as an answer.
 Any answer to the question &quot;Why does such-and-such happen?&quot;
presupposes that &quot;such-and-such&quot; acutally happens. 
<BR>
Examples: <BR>
1. Yes or no, have you stopped beating your wife? <BR>
2. Which dress should I buy, the red one or the blue one? <BR>
3. Do you want to give the babies a bath or fix dinner?   <BR>
l. Ignoratio elenchi <BR>
An argument that is supposed to prove one proposition but succeeds
only in proving a different one.  &quot;Ignoratio elenchi&quot;
stands for &quot;pure and simple irrelevance.&quot;  It is a non-sequitar.
<BR>
Example: <BR>
A man is being tried for murder and the lawyer proves that murder
is a horrible crime. <BR>
m. argumentum ad antiquitam <BR>
A fallacy of asserting that something is right or good simply
because it is old; that is, because &quot;that's the way it's
always been.&quot; <BR>
n. argumentum ad crumenam <BR>
A falacy of believing that money is a criterion of correctness;
that those with more money are more likely to be right. <BR>
o. argumentum ad lazarum <BR>
A falacy assuming that because someone is poor he or she is sounder
or more virtuous than one who is wealthier.  This is the opposite
of argumentum ad crumenam. <BR>
p. argumentum ad naseum <BR>
The incorrect belief that an assertion is more likely to be true
the more often it is heard.  An &quot;argumentum ad naseum&quot;
is one that employs constant repitition in asserting a concept.
<BR>
q. argumentum ad novitam <BR>
A fallacy of asserting that something is more correct simply because
it is new or newer than something else.  Or that something is
better because it is newer.  This type of fallacy is the opposite
of the &quot;argumentum ad antiquitam&quot; fallacy. <BR>
r. argumentum ad numeram <BR>
 <BR>
A fallacy that asserts that the more people who support or believe
a proposition then the more likely that the proposition is correct;
it equates mass support with correctness. <BR>
s. bifurcation <BR>
Also referred to as the &quot;black and white&quot; fallacy. 
Bifurcation is the presentation of a situation or condition with
only two alternatives, whereas in fact other alternatives exist
or can exist. <BR>
t. Coverting a conditional <BR>
If P then Q, therefore if Q then P. <BR>
u. False analogy <BR>
An analogy is a partial similarity between the like features of
two things or events on which a comparison can be made.  A false
analogy involves comparing two things that are NOT similar.  Note
that the two things may be similar in a superficial way, but not
with respect to what is being argued. <BR>
A has x <BR>
B has x<BR>
Therefore A is B <BR>
Example: <BR>
&quot;In every country the communists have taken over, the first
thing they do is outlaw cockfighting.&quot;  -- John Monks, Oklahoma
State Representative arguing against a bill to outlaw cockfighting.
<BR>
v. Illicit process <BR>
A syllogistic argument in which a term is distributed in the conclusion,
but not in the premises.  One of the rules for a valid categorical
syllogism is that if either term is distributed in the conclusion,
then it must be distributed in the premises.  There are two types
of illicit process: illicit process of the major term and illicit
process of the minor term. <BR>
w. Quaternio terminorum <BR>
An argument of the syllogistic form in which there occur four
or more terms.  In a standard categorical syllogism there are
only three terms: a subject, a predicate and a middle term. <BR>
x. Red Herring <BR>
A fallacy when irrelevant material is introduced to the issue
being discussed, such that everyone's attention is diverted away
from the points being made, and toward a different conclusion.
 It is not logically valid to divert a chain of reasoning with
extraneous points. <BR>
y. Special Pleading <BR>
Special pleading is a logical fallacy wherein a double standard
is employed by the person making the assertion.  Special pleading
typically happens when one insists upon less strict treatment
for the argument he/she is making than he or she would make when
evaluating someone else's arguments. <BR>
z. Straw Man <BR>
 <BR>
It is a fallacy to misrepresent someone else's position for the
purposes of more easily attacking it, then to knock down that
misrepresented position, and then to conclude that the original
position has been demolished.  It is a fallacy because it fails
to deal with the actual arguments that have been made. <BR>
aa. Two Wrongs Make a Right (Tu quoque) <BR>
Two wrongs never add up to a right.  you cannot right a wrong
by applying yet another wrong.  Such a fallacy is a misplaced
appeal to consistency.  It is a fallacy because it makes no attempt
to deal with the subject under discussion. <BR>
Example: <BR>
The U.S. criticizes China's poor human rights record.  China criticises
the U.S. because of its treatment of minorities. <BR>
bb. Shifting the Burden of Proof <BR>
The burden of proof is always on the person making the assertion
or proposition.  Shifting the burden of proof, a special case
of &quot;argumentum ad ignorantium,&quot; is a fallacy of putting
the burden of proof on the person who denies or questions the
assertion being made.  The source of the fallacy is the assumption
that something is true unless proven otherwise.  <BR>
2. Fallacies of ambiguity <BR>
An argument in the course of which at least one term is used in
different senses.  Also known as eqivocation.  There are several
types, for example:   <BR>
a. amphiboly <BR>
A type of fallacy of ambiguity where the ambiguity involved is
of an &quot;amphibolous&quot; (equivocal or uncertain) nature.
 Amphiboly is a syntactic error.  The fallacy is caused by faulty
sentence structure, and can result in a meaning not intended by
the author. <BR>
Example: <BR>
The department store has pants for men with 32 waists.   <BR>
b. accent due to contiguity <BR>
Two statements which are true are brought together and made confusing.
<BR>
Example: <BR>
   <BR>
c. equivocation <BR>
Using double meanings.  Plays on words.  Puns fit this category
nicely.   <BR>
d. composition <BR>
An argument in which one assumes that a whole has a property solely
becaus its various parts have that property. <BR>
Examples:<BR>
1. Fidel Castro, the ruler of Cuba, is a wealthy man. Therefore,
Cuba must be a wealthy country.<BR>
2. Christianity preaches love, forgiveness and good deeds.  Therefore,
Jane, who claims to be a Christian, must be loving, forgiving,
and good.<BR>
Composition may take place in two ways: <BR>
1. From each part to the whole.  Example: atoms are invisible.
 Tables are made up of atoms.  Therefore, tables are invisible.
<BR>
2. From a quality distributed over each part of a whole to the
collection.  i.e., A, B, C, D, and E are the best basketball players
in our school.  Therefore they will make up the vest team. <BR>
The fallacy of composition is sometimes confused with the fallacy
of converse accident (hasty generalization), if both arguments
are thought of simply as proceeding from particular statements
to general statements.  Converse accident (hasty generalization)
comes from asserting that what is true of one element (or small
sample) is thus true of all.  There is great danger in inadequate
samples.   <BR>
e. division <BR>
An argument in which one assumes that a part has a property solely
because the whole has that property. <BR>
Example: <BR>
The United States is the richest country in the world.  Therefore,
Andrew, a U.S. citizen, must be a wealthy man.  <BR>
 <BR>
The fallacy of division is sometimes confused with the fallacy
of accident if both arguments are thought of simply as proceeding
from general statements to particular statements. <BR>
We distinguish them thus: <BR>
Division takes place when we look at a situation: <BR>
One starts with a premise asserting that some particular property
belongs to a collection, and then argues to the individual member
of that collection.  i.e., President Carter was rejected by the
voters in his second bid for office.  Walter Mondale (his Vice
President) is a voter.  Walter Mondale rejected President Carter.
 Or, The U.S. Army is powerful.  Therefore each soldier is powerful.
<BR>
Accident takes place when we look at a rule which is USUALLY true.
 For instance, Knifing a man should be punished.  Therefore surgeons
should be punished.   <BR>
f.  Reification <BR>
To reify something is to convert an abstract concept into a concrete
thing.  Reification is a fallacy of ambiguity.  Reification is
also sometimes called the fallacy of &quot;hypostatization.&quot;
