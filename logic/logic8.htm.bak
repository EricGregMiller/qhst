<b> H. Epistemological issues</b>  <BR>
1. Scientific laws <BR>
Scientific laws are descriptive generalizations having predictive
value.  An example would be Newton's law of gravitation: <BR>
Every particle in the universe attracts every other particle with
a force directly proportional to the product of the two masses
and inversely as the square of the distance between them. <BR>
 <BR>
Unlike theories, laws are discovered, rather than devised.  Their
truth is highly probable.  That is, the mathematical likelihood
of events ocurring according to them are very high. <BR>
They are universal hypotheses which are capable of being confirmed
or disconfirmed by empirical findings.  <BR>
2. Hypotheses <BR>
Hypotheses are particular, explanitory statements; they are educated
guesses.  George is dead on the floor.  Why?  Maybe he drank poison.
 <BR>
3. Theories <BR>
Theories are general explanatory statements or explanitory models.
 Hypotheses and theories are 1) provisional yet probable because
they are grounded in facts; and 2) they are predictive because
they are capable of accounting for the facts. <BR>
In establishing a particular hypothesis or general theory, induction
leads to the generalization that is the theory proposed or suggests
the hypothesis that is proposed. Deduction on the other hand,
determines whether the generalization or theory implies the facts
serving as evidence.  Confirming the facts makes the hypothesis
or theory probable.  <BR>
4. Causality <BR>
Causal principle has at least three general interpretations: 
 <BR>
a) Empirical (a posteriori) interpretation.  Cause is a generalization
from the facts and dependent on the facts.  Cause is the observed
constant conjunction of certain events.  Whenever A, then B. 
 <BR>
b) Rational (a priori) interpretation.  Cause is viewed as a necessary
connection between two events, wherein an appropriate effect must
follow the cause according to the principle of sufficient reason.
 We know a priori that causality is a necessary principle of reality,
that there can be no uncaused evnents, or that causality is a
necessary principle of knowledge.  If A, then B.   <BR>
c) Pragmatic interpretation.  Cause is viewed as a useful or guiding
principle of scientific explanation, althought much of science
may not need it.  One version is the &quot;recipe&quot; theory,
wherein cause is likened to a recipe for producing or preventing
something.  We produce B by producing A and speak of A as causing
B.  That is, we cause iron to glow by heating it and therefore
speak of the heating of the iron as the cause of its glow.  Another
version pictures the causal principle as a proposal to uncover
uniformities in the world -- that is, a procedural rule which
is neither ture nor false because it is not about anything but
is merely a fruitful way of looking at or dealing with anything.
<BR>
Some considerations of causality: <BR>
1. Causality is not the same as logical necessity -- as in &quot;Black
cats are black.&quot; <BR>
2. Causality in science is not prescriptive, as in &quot;The law
commands obedience&quot;. <BR>
3. Causality as a necessary condition (if effect, then cause)
does not mean necessary connection.  Necessary condition means
that in the absence of a particular condition, a particular effect
never occurs -- as in &quot;In the absence of oxygen, we never
have fire.&quot; <BR>
4. Causality as a sufficient condition (if cause, then effect)
also does not mean necessary connection.  Sufficient condition
means that a particualr condition is always followed by a certain
effect, as in &quot;If rain is falling, the ground is wet.&quot;
 Cause as necessary or sufficient condition is empiricist theory.
 Cause as necessary connection is traditional rationalist theory.
<BR>
5. Cause is usually taken to mean the whole set of conditions
sufficient for the occurance of the event.  If the cause is singular,
these sufficient conditions are also necessary conditions.  If
the cause is plural, these sufficient condititions are not all
necessary conditions.  <BR>
5. Scientific explanation <BR>
&quot;Why is an ambiguous question -- it may be a request for
either a reason or an explanation. <BR>
Reasons are given for holding beliefs -- as in giving reasons
for why one believes the world is round. <BR>
Explanations are given for what occurs -- as in explaining why
earthquakes happen or why carbon monoxide is poisoness.  These
are scientific explanations, although &quot;explain&quot; can
be used in other ways, as in refering to making an idea clear.
<BR>
One may have reasons for believing certain things, and these reasons
may also be explanations for believing them, as in when one wants
to believe what is true.  On the other hand, one may give reasons
why, that is, he believes that God exists or that a certain kind
of act is wrong.  One may justify his beliefs.  This is a logical
matter; whereas the explanation of his beliefs about God or morality,
that is, the psychological question, is something else.  He may,
for instance, have had certain experiences or needs that caused
the belief.  These would explain the belief.  Explanations have
to do with causes. <BR>
Scientific explanations are scientific laws, hypotheses, or theories.
 The laws, hypotheses or theories are the explanation.  An event
is explained when it is &quot;brought under&quot; a law, hypothesis,
or theory. <BR>
The covering law model of scientific explanation is as follows:
<BR>
All copper conducts electricity (explanation) <BR>
This substance is copper. <BR>
This substance conducts electricity (thing to be explained) <BR>
The statement about what is explained is deduced from the explanation,
i.e., all the premises together, of which at least one is a generalization
-- a scientific law, hypothesis, or theory.  If the part of the
explanation is only probably true, the explanation is probable.
 The generalization need not be empirical.  It may be logical,
as in: &quot;One person can't be at two places at the same time.&quot;
 In this case the explanation is logical rather than empirical
or scientific. <BR>
A scientific explanation must have predictive value; that is,
it must be able to explain events other than the one it is invoked
to explain and therefore be able to predict the occurence of these
events.
