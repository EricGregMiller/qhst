<b> A. What is Logic?</b> <BR>
Logic is the study of the principles of reasoning, especially
valid reasoning, as distinguished from invalid or irrational argumentation.
<BR><P>
<b>B. Inductive arguments</b>  <BR>
a. Scientific method and induction <BR>
We accept the truth of a statement usually on the basis of the
evidence of observation.  These are called inductive arguments.
<BR>
Many of the conclusions or hypotheses we consider it reasonable
to accept are supported by inductive argument alone.  The theoretical
statements of empirical science -- for example, statements about
unobserved submicroscopic particles -- are neither empirically
falsifiable nor empirically verifiable.  Consider any statement
of empirical science which concerns the behavior or properties
of such particles as neutrinos.  Nothing we could observe inside
or outside the laboratory would entail that the neutrino has the
properties ascribed to it.  It is at least logically possible
that the meter readings and other observable phenomena should
occur and that there should not exist any neutrinos at all.  It
is logically possible, if scientifically implausible, to suppose
that the correct explanation of the phenomena we observe inside
the laboratory is one that does not depend on the hypothesis that
neutrinos exist but rather on some as yet unconceived of and perhaps
undreamt of theory which will be proposed many years hence.  On
the other hand, should the neutrino hypothesis come to be rejected
in science, this will not result from our observing something
that entails the falsity of the neutrino hypothesis.  It will
remain at least logically possible that our present theory is
correct, that the neutrino really does exist, no matter what we
observe.  The neutrino hypothesis is neither conclusively verifiable
nor falsifiable by observation. <BR>
Of course, these remarks are not intended to suggest that the
results of scientific inquiry are a mere chimera, mere guessing.
 On the contrary, the theories and hypotheses scientists accept
are in many cases well supported and justified by the evidence
of observation.  But the point is that the evidence is inductive,
as in the inference made from it.  Furthermore, the a posteriori
statements that are neither conclusively verifiable nor falsifiable
are not the only class of statements we accept on the basis of
inductive evidence.  On the contrary, most statements that are
conclusively verifiable or falsifiable by observation are also
accepted on the basis of inductive evidence. <BR>
The reason for this is quite simple. <BR>
There are many statements that could be falsified or verified
by observation but are such that we are not in a position to
observe the things in question.  Consider some statement about
the past, for example, that a certain man was born on January
10, 1936.  the fact that he was born on that date is something
that could be observed, but obviously, he is in no position to
observe that hallowed event.  If he accepts the statement, then
his acceptance of it must be based on inductive evidence of the
usual sort: his parents' word, the information on his birth certificate,
and so forth.  Indeed all statements about things that happen
at other times and places are statements which, if we accept them
at all, are accepted on the basis of evidence that does not entail
their truth. <BR>
Universal statements, if accepted, must also be accepted on the
basis of inductive evidence, because they are not conclusively
verifiable by observation; and particular statements, if held
to be false, must be so held on the basis of inductive evidence,
because they are not conclusively falsifiable by observation. 
When we consider the vast number of things that we believe, we
will soon discover that induction is the warrant of most of them.
 It is rare to elicit premises from observation from which one
can validly deduce the truth of those a posteriori statements
one believes.  The deduction almost always fails, but the powers
of human reason refuse to be restrained by the limits of deductive
reasoning.  When a deductive argument is not forthcoming to defend
our beliefs but the evidence seems strong nonetheless, then induction
is called upon to meet our needs.  Hence it is essential that
we obtain some understanding of this variety of argumentation.
<BR>
INDUCTIVE COGENCY <BR>
In an inductive argument, the premises are evidence for the conclusion
or hypothesis.  Unlike a sound deductive argument in which the
premises entail the conclusion, the evidence of sound inductive
argument does not entail the hypothesis inferred from it.  What
then, is a sound inductive argument?  One condition of soundness
is that the evidence must consist of true statements. <BR>
A sound inductive argument is one in which the statements of evidence
are true, and in which if the premises are true, then it is reasonable
to accept the hypothesis as true.  So the second condition of
soundness of an inductive argument, which we shall call inductive
cogency, may be put as follows: if the evidence is true, it is
reasonable to accept the hypothesis as true also.<BR>
FORMS OF INDUCTIVE ARGUMENTS <BR>
One familiar variety of inductive argument is a statistical argument
in which the evidence or the hypothesis is a statistical statement
concerning the percentage of things of one sort that are another.
 One example of a statistical statement is the statement that
67 percent of the cats of Dibar are rabid.  This statement may
be a hypothesis of an argument inferred from the evidence of observation.
 It may also be used as evidence for some conclusion about the
health of a cat whose health is undetermined.  Two forms of argument
that could be employed are induction by enumeration and statistical
syllogism.  <BR>
b. Induction by enumeration <BR>
X per cent of the examined members of A are B <BR>
Therefore <BR>
X percent of the members of A are B  <BR>
c. statistical syllogism <BR>
X percent of the members of A are B (X being greater than 50).
<BR>
O is an unexamined member of A <BR>
Therefore <BR>
O is a member of B <BR>
The following two arguments instantiate these forms:<BR>
67 percent of the examined cats of Dibar are rabid.<BR>
Therefore<BR>
67 percent of the cats of Dibar are rabid.<BR>
and<BR>
The cat that bit me is an unexamined cat of Dibar.<BR>
Therefore<BR>
The cat that bit me is rabid. <BR>
These two arguments illustrate very familiar forms of inductive
statistical argument.  It is apparent that the hypotheses inferred
from the evidence are not validly deducible from them.  It is
logically possible that what we have observed to be true of a
certain percentage of the cats in a sample is not characteristic
of the same percentage of cats in the total population of Dibar,
and it is logically possible that what is characteristic of a
certain percentage of cats of Dibar is not characteristic of a
particular unexamined cat.  There is one exception that should
be noted.  If we have a statistical syllogism in which the evidence
is that 100 percent of the members of A are B, and ) is a member
of A (unexamined or not), then, of course, it follows deductively
that O is B.  However, except for this extreme case, we must add
other restrictions to render plausible the claim that arguments
of these forms are inductively cogent. <BR>
The foregoing argument illustrates a typical problem confronting
the attempt to provide argument forms for inductive logic.  There
is an underlying difficulty that generates the problem.  It is
natural to assume that just as a valid deductive argument is one
in which if the premises are true, then the conclusion must be
true, so a cogent inductive argument is one in which, if the evidence
statements are true, then the hypothesis is <I>probable</I>. 
<BR>
Probability, even high probability, will not suffice for inductive
cogency.  In both induction by enumeration and statistical syllogism
we may suppose that the inferred hypothesis is probable, even
highly probable, on the basis of the evidence.  Thus one inclined
toward the idea that the argument form is cogent.  But this natural
line of reasoning leads directly to inconsistency. <BR>
A more general argument is available to show that probability,
even very high probability, of a hypothesis on the basis of evidence
does NOT suffice for inductive cogency.  It depends on considering
fair lotteries which enable us to specify probabilities with precision.
 Suppose, for example, that we think any hypothesis having a probability
of 99/100 or greater on the basis of evidence may be cogently
inferred from the evidence of induction.  Imagine we have a lottery
containing 100 tickets numbered consecutively from 1 to 100. 
Imagine a ticket has been drawn and the lottery is fair.  All
this is our evidence.  Now consider ticket number 100.  The probability
on the evidence that it was drawn is 1/100.  There is one chance
in a hundred that it was drawn.  This means that the probability
that some other ticket was drawn is 99/100.  Assuming that this
is a high enough probability for cogent inductive inference, we
may cogently infer from the evidence that some ticket other than
the 100 ticket was drawn.  Beginning from the same evidence we
could use an argument of the same form to infer that some ticket
other than 99 was drawn, that some ticket other than the 98 ticket
was drawn, and so forth.  In each case the hypothesis would have
a probability of 99/100 on the evidence.  So for each ticket we
could cogently infer that some other ticket was drawn.  But then
the set of conclusions would be inconsistent with our original
evidence.  For the set of conclusion would tell us, for each
ticket, that it was not drawn, and this is inconsistent with
our evidence which tells us that one ticket WAS drawn.  In short,
the set of hypotheses inductively inferred entails each of the
tickets numbered from 1 to 100 is not drawn whereas our evidence
tells us that one of them is. <BR>
The preceding argument shows that inductive arguments of the following
form are NOT cogent:  <BR>
d. induction by probability <BR>
It is highly probable that P <BR>
Therefore <BR>
P <BR>
They are not cogent because such argument forms lead from true
evidence statements to inconsistent statements.  We have said
that a cogent inductive argument is one in which, if the statements
of evidence are true, then it is reasonable to accept the hypothesis
as true for the purpose of accepting true hypotheses and avoiding
error.  By accepting an inconsistent set of statements we insure
that some statement we accept is erroneous.  Therefore, inductive
argument forms are not cogent when they warrant the inference
of an inconsistent set of statements from true evidence statements.
<BR>
The preceding argument illustrates the difficulty of attempting
to specify any form of argument that is inductively cogent.  We
may obtain an improved account of inductive cogency by noting
the importance of the concept of competition among hypotheses
as a feature of induction. <BR>
Whether it is reasonable to accept a statement as true depends
on what other statements it competes with as well as on the probability
of the statement as evidence. <BR>
To understand this, consider once again the conclusion of the
induction by enumeration concerning cats.  The hypothesis inductively
inferred was that 67 percent of the cats of Dibar are rabid. 
Is it reasonable to accept that hypothesis on the basis of the
evidence?  The answer to the question depends on what statements
you take that hypothesis to compete with.  If the competition consists
of other statements specifying the exact percentage of rabidity
of the cats of Dibar, then tit would be more reasonable to accept
that hypotheses than any of the others because it is more probable
than any others.  On the other hand, if the competition includes
not only hypotheses concerning exact percentages but also less
exact hypotheses -- for example, the statement that the percentage
lies somewhere between 60 and 80 percent -- then the issue has
been radically changed. For the hypothesis that the percentage
lies within that interval is much more probable than the more
exact hypothesis specifying the percentage at a single point within
that interval. <BR>
We conclude that inductive cogency depends in an essential way
on the evidential and conceptual context of reasoning.  We can
give a definition of inductive cogency in terms of the notion of
competition as follows: <BR>
An inductive argument from evidence to hypothesis is inductively
cogent if and only if the hypothesis is that hypothesis which,
of all the competing hypotheses, has the greatest probability of
being true on the basis of the evidence. <BR>
Thus, whether it is reasonable to accept a hypothesis as true
if the statements of evidence are true is determined by whether
that hypothesis is the most probable on the evidence of those
with which it competes. <BR>
The conclusion we have reached supplies us with a methodology
for checking the cogency of an inductive argument.  Confronted
with an inductive argument, one should pose two critical questions:
<BR>
1. What statements does the hypothesis of the argument compete
with? <BR>
2. Is the hypothesis more probable than those hypotheses with
which it competes? <BR>
Only if the answer to the second question is affirmative may we
consider the argument cogent.
