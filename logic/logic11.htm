<b> K. Truth</b>  <BR>
1. The nature of truth   <BR>
a. Truth may be descriptive, applying to statements, propositions,
or beliefs that are a) necessarily, i.e., analytically, true,
as, e.g., &quot;If p implies q and p is the case, then q is the
case,&quot; or b) contingently, i.e., empirically, true, as, e.g.,
&quot;The earth is round.&quot;  &quot;Truth&quot; functions as
an adjective, e.g., true beliefs.   <BR>
b. Truth may be instrumental, applying to beliefs that guide thought
or actions successfully, as, e.g., acting on the belief that fire
burns helps one avoid getting burned.  &quot;Truth&quot; functions
as an adverb, e.g., One believes truly.   <BR>
c. Truth may be substantive or ontological, referring to the real,
as in &quot;God is truth&quot;.  Truth then functions as a noun.
  <BR>
d. Truth may be existential, referring to one's way of life or
ultimate commitment.  One lives rather than knows the truth. 
&quot;Truth&quot; then functions as a verb.  <BR>
2. The criteria of truth   <BR>
a. correspondence theory <BR>
That idea or proposition is true which accurately and adequately
resembles or represents the reality it is supposed to describe;
e.g., &quot;It is raining now&quot; is true if as a matter of
fact rain is now falling. <BR>
This theory is usually that of epistemological realism (Aristotle,
Locke, Russell). <BR>
An objection: it may be impossible to establish correspondence:
&quot;How can I know that my idea corresponds to its object even
if in fact it does?&quot; <BR>
Ideas are radically different from objects. <BR>
Austin modifies the theory to hold that the correspondence is
in the nature of an appropriate correlation rather than congruity
or resemblance.  &quot;The truth of a statement is a matter ...
of the words used being the ones conventionally appointed for
situations of the type to which that referred to belongs.&quot;
  <BR>
b. Coherence theory <BR>
That idea or proposition is true which &quot;fits in&quot; or
is consistent with or is necessitated by the totality of truth
of which it is a part.  This theory is usually, though not necessarily,
held by idealists (Hegel, Bradley, Blanshard).  It is also held
by nonidealists like Carnap and Neurath.  An objections is that
this theory assumes a metaphysical unity which may not exist.
 Also, as Russell points out, coherence may be a test or even
a necessary condition of truth, but it is not what is meant by
truth.   <BR>
c. pragmatic theory <BR>
That idea or proposition is true which works or satisfies or is
capable of doing so.  Specifically:  <BR>
1) James: &quot;We cannot reject any hypothesis if consequences
useful to life flow from it...If the hypothesis God works [for
the individual]...it is true.&quot;  Initially James defined truth
as that which works.  Later he defined it as   <BR>
a) that which has &quot;cash value&quot;; i.e., is verifiable
in principle   <BR>
b) that which has coherence; i.e., fits present or anticipated
facts   <BR>
c) that which favors higher values; i.e. encourages progress 
<BR>
2) Pierce and Dewey:  They give a social interpretation in terms
of predictive power.  Truth must be socially as well as experimentally
verifiable -- not just privately useful.  Truth is public, not
private.  &quot;The opinion which is fated to be ultimately agreed
to by all who investigate is what we mean by truth.&quot;
