<b> E. The Nature of Knowing</b>
<P>
  1. Knowing a statement to be true involves:
<P>
   a. the fact that in some sense or by some criterion the statement
is actually true.
<P>
   b. the belief that it is true
<P>
   c. evidence to support that belief
<P>
  2. The problem of evidence
<P>
   a. If evidence is complete, then knowing is certain.
<P>
   b. If evidence is partial, knowing is probable
<P>
  3. The problem of certainty
<P>
 Can empirical knowledge ever be certain?
<P>
 What evidence, and how much evidence, is required for any degree
of certainty?
<P>
 F. Theories of the a priori
<P>
  1. Theory of the intrinsic a priori
<P>
 Certain principles or ideas are believed to be self-evident;
that is, they are known intuitively because of their distinctness
and clarity. Example: &quot;I think, therefore I am.&quot; --
Rene Descartes
<P>
  2. Presuppositional theory of the a priori
<P>
 The a priori is understood as the necessary condition of the
possibility of intelligible experience or knowing.
<P>
  3. Analytical theory of the a priori
<P>
 The a priori constitutes rules or postulates arbitrarily posited
or agreed upon in advance as the basis for reasoning.  That is,
what we propose to mean by certain words.
