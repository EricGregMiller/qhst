<center><h2>Hosea 10</h2></center><p>

<i>1 Israel is a luxuriant vine, that putteth forth his fruit: according to the abundance of his fruit he hath multiplied his altars; according to the goodness of their land they have made goodly pillars.</i> 
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The more prosperous Israel is, the more it sins and constructs altars to idols.  The more prosperity the more deceit and guilt.
<p>
<i>2 Their heart is divided; now shall they be found guilty: he will smite their altars, he will destroy their pillars. 3 Surely now shall they say, We have no king; for we fear not Jehovah; and the king, what can he do for us? 4 They speak vain words, swearing falsely in making covenants: therefore judgment springeth up as hemlock in the furrows of the field. </i>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They have utterly abandoned their true King, Yahweh.  So, again, they will be punished.
<p>
<i>5 The inhabitants of Samaria shall be in terror for the calves of Beth-aven; for the people thereof shall mourn over it, and the priests thereof that rejoiced over it, for the glory thereof, because it is departed from it. 6 It also shall be carried unto Assyria for a present to king Jareb: Ephraim shall receive shame, and Israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel. </i>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; These verses tells what will happen to their worthless idols.  
<p>
<i>7 As for Samaria, her king is cut off, as foam upon the water. 8 The high places also of Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be destroyed: the thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars; and they shall say to the mountains, Cover us; and to the hills, Fall on us.  </i>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The king will be as helpless as a piece of wood on a wave.  And those who are left in the land will pray that the land swallow them up so that they do not fall into the hands of God’s judgment.
<p>
<i>9 O Israel, thou hast sinned from the days of Gibeah: there they stood; the battle against the children of iniquity doth not overtake them in Gibeah. 10 When it is my desire, I will chastise them; and the peoples shall be gathered against them, when they are bound to their two transgressions. 11 And Ephraim is a heifer that is taught, that loveth to tread out the grain; but I have passed over upon her fair neck: I will set a rider on Ephraim; Judah shall plow, Jacob shall break his cl are absolutely out of control -- and like a beast of burden they must be chained and controlled or they will destroy both field, home and land.</i>
<p>
<i>12 Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap according to kindness; break up your fallow ground; for it is time to seek Jehovah, till he come and rain righteousness upon you. </i>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This counterpoint of hope is embedded in the oracle of doom.  Why?  Because as long as there is life there is hope of repentance and restoration.
<p>
<i>13 Ye have plowed wickedness, ye have reaped iniquity; ye have eaten the fruit of lies; for thou didst trust in thy way, in the multitude of thy mighty men. 14 Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people, and all thy fortresses shall be destroyed, as Shalman destroyed Beth-arbel in the day of battle: the mother was dashed in pieces with her children. 15 So shall Beth-el do unto you because of your great wickedness: at daybreak shall the king of Israel be utterly cut off.  </i>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The kingdom is yoked because of arrogant self reliance.  Shalman is Shalmenesser I, king of Assyria.  Unfortunately we don’t have any note of a campaign against Beth Arbel.
