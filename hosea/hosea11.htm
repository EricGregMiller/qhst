<center><h2>Hosea 11</h2></center><p>

<i>1 When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt. 2 The more the prophets called them, the more they went from them: they sacrificed unto the Baalim, and burned incense to graven images. 3 Yet I taught Ephraim to walk; I took them on my arms; but they knew not that I healed them. 4 I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love; and I was to them as they that lift up the yoke on their jaws; and I laid food before them. 5 They shall not return into the land of Egypt; but the Assyrian shall be their king, because they refused to return to me. 6 And the sword shall fall upon their cities, and shall consume their bars, and devour them, because of their own counsels. 7 And my people are bent on backsliding from me: though they call them to him that is on high, none at all will exalt him.</i>   
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The themes recapitulated here (and from this point in the book) will make it unnecessary to make many comments -- as the material has already been seen a number of times in the book to this point.  Nevertheless, it is significant that Hosea here portrays God as a loving parent who nurtures, sustains, and loves his children- even though they wayward be.
<p>
<i>8 How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? how shall I cast thee off, Israel? how shall I make thee as Admah? how shall I set thee as Zeboiim? my heart is turned within me, my compassions are kindled together. 9 I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger, I will not return to destroy Ephraim: for I am God, and not man; the Holy One in the midst of thee; and I will not come in wrath. </i> 
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; God is on the verge of destroying them- but balks.  This is a truly profound passage of Scripture.  God transcends his own inclinations when it benefits his children.
<p>
<i>10 They shall walk after Jehovah, who will roar like a lion; for he will roar, and the children shall come trembling from the west. 11 They shall come trembling as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of the land of Assyria; and I will make them to dwell in their houses, saith Jehovah. 12 Ephraim compasseth me about with falsehood, and the house of Israel with deceit; but Judah yet ruleth with God, and is faithful with the Holy One. </i> 
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; God reverses not only the condemnation    of v.5, where Ammi isnd Assyria; but also the threats found earlier in the book.
