<center><h2>Hosea 9</h2></center>
<p>
<i>1 Rejoice not, O Israel, for joy, like the peoples; for thou hast played the harlot, departing from thy God; thou hast loved hire upon every grain-floor. </i>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The festival of Sukkoth was celebrated in the fall.  It was a festival of great rejoicing.  But here it is “cancelled” because it commemorated deliverance- and there would be no more deliverance.
<p>
<i>2 The threshing-floor and the winepress shall not feed them, and the new wine shall fail her. 3 They shall not dwell in Jehovah's land; but Ephraim shall return to Egypt, and they shall eat unclean food in Assyria. 4 They shall not pour out wine-offerings to Jehovah, neither shall they be pleasing unto him: their sacrifices shall be unto them as the bread of mourners; all that eat thereof shall be polluted; for their bread shall be for their appetite; it shall not come into the house of Jehovah. </i>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The land will be made as useless and barren as the people’s soul’s.  Even their food will be what they are -- unclean.
<p>
<i>5 What will ye do in the day of solemn assembly, and in the day of the feast of Jehovah? 6 For, lo, they are gone away from destruction; yet Egypt shall gather them up, Memphis shall bury them; their pleasant things of silver, nettles shall possess them; thorns shall be in their tents. </i>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What will they do on the feast day?  Absolutely NOTHING!!!!  Hosea here shows that the refugees who flee to Egypt when the Assyrians attack will only find there a cemetery.  Memphis had a huge and famous cemetery.  
 <p>
<i>7 The days of visitation are come, the days of recompense are come; Israel shall know it: the prophet is a fool, the man that hath the spirit is mad, for the abundance of thine iniquity, and because the enmity is great. 8 Ephraim was a watchman with my God: as for the prophet, a fowler's snare is in all his ways, and enmity in the house of his God. 9 They have deeply corrupted themselves, as in the days of Gibeah: he will remember their iniquity, he will visit their sins.</i> 
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The subject changes from message to messenger.  Hosea reminds the people that the one they call a fool has been called by God to deliver the message he has given.  He is a sentinel warning of attack, not an    enemy!  Such hatred aown.  See Jer 11:18-19, 18:18-23, 20:7-12, and Matt. 23:37.  
The “day of Gibeah” must refer to the horrible rape of the Levite’s concubine recorded in Judges 19-21 and the war that ensued from that horrid act.
 <p>
<i>10 I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your fathers as the first-ripe in the fig-tree at its first season: but they came to Baal-peor, and consecrated themselves unto the shameful thing, and became abominable like that which they loved.  </i>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Note the contrast between God’s love and Israel’s continuous betrayal.  Grapes do not frequently grow wild in the desert.  But disobedience was as common as the people, see Num 25:1-5.
<p>
<i>11 As for Ephraim, their glory shall fly away like a bird: there shall be no birth, and none with child, and no conception. 12 Though they bring up their children, yet will I bereave them, so that not a man shall be left: yea, woe also to them when I depart from them! </i>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ephraim squanders her redemption.  She has lost her future and abandoned her only hope.
<p>
<i>13 Ephraim, like as I have seen Tyre, is planted in a pleasant place: but Ephraim shall bring out his children to the slayer. </i>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ephraim has to lead her children to slaughter- to the gas chamber, as it were.
<p>
<i>14 Give them, O Jehovah--what wilt thou give? give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts. </i>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What an incredible prayer!  Hosea prays for them to be completely fruitless.  It is the opposite of the promise of seed given to Abraham!
<p>
<i>15 All their wickedness is in Gilgal; for there I hated them: because of the wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of my house; I will love them no more; all their princes are revolters. </i>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Gilgal is the place where Saul made his illicit sacrifice and as a result lost the kingdom.  See 1 Sam 11:14-15, 13;8-15.   
<p>
<i>16 Ephraim is smitten, their root is dried up, they shall bear no fruit: yea, though they bring forth, yet will I slay the beloved fruit of their womb. </i>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The grapevine that once grew miraculously in the desert now is a stricken plant with shriveled roots.  It is dead.
<p>
<i>17 My God will cast them away, because they did not hearken unto him; and they shall be wanderers among the nations. </i>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The one who once found them in the wilderness will now reject them.
