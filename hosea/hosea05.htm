<center><h2>Hosea 5</h2></center><p>

<i>1 Hear this, O ye priests, and hearken, O house of Israel, and give ear, O house of the king; for unto you pertaineth the judgment; for ye have been a snare at Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor.  2 And the revolters are gone deep in making slaughter; but I am a rebuker of them all.</i> 
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The leadership of Israel has failed to carry out its sacred responsibilities.  Instead of life, they are snares of death.
<p>
<i>3 I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me; for now, O Ephraim, thou hast played the harlot, Israel is defiled. </i>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Israel has become loathsome to God, because they have defiled Him by defiling His worship.  
<p>
<i>4 Their doings will not suffer them to turn unto their God; for the spirit of whoredom is within them, and they know not Jehovah. </i>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They are deliberate in their rebellion against God.  They have not “fallen” from Grace -- they have turned their backs on it, run from it, despised it, and abandoned it.  They are so oriented in disobedience that they are wholly possessed by a spirit of adultery and idolatry.  
<p>
<i>5 And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: therefore Israel and Ephraim shall stumble in their iniquity; Judah also shall stumble with them.</i><p> 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whenever people abandon God, they are given over to self indulgence.  And self indulgence leads no-where.  It is death itself that the people have embraced, and not life, peace, or security.  Yet their self centeredness does not allow them to see this.
<p>
<i>6 They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek Jehovah; but they shall not find him: he hath withdrawn himself from them. </i>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And though the people bring a multitude of offerings, they will not persuade God to keep his hand from judging them.  God will not give in to their bribery.
<p>
<i>7 They have dealt treacherously against Jehovah; for they have borne strange children: now shall the new moon devour them with their fields. </i>

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The word “treacherously” comes from a verb that means “to defraud, to act unfaithfully”.  The people of Israel have defrauded God of what is rightly his:  themselves!  As a result they have borne    children who know notot inherit what only He can give.
<p>
<i>8 Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah: sound an alarm at Beth-aven; behind thee, O Benjamin. </i>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This describes the activity of the watch guard.  War is coming!  The route of the advancing army moves from south to north, from Gibeah to Beth-awen.  From the outskirts of the kingdom to the heart of the central valley.  In other words, the army will strike and not be repelled.  
<p>
<i>9 Ephraim shall become a desolation in the day of rebuke: among the tribes of Israel have I made known that which shall surely be. </i>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At about this same time Isaiah was preaching a similar message, see Is 8:9-15.
<p>
<i>10 The princes of Judah are like them that remove the landmark: I will pour out my wrath upon them like water. </i>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Judah too is not innocent- in fact her leaders are deceitful thieves as well.  Removing landmarks was a terribly crime because one only knew his property by where the landmarks were placed.  Any moving of such markers was land theft pure and simple.  See Dt 27:17.  
<p>
<i>11 Ephraim is oppressed, he is crushed in judgment; because he was content to walk after man's command. </i>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The nothingness and worthlessness of the idols is constantly hammered home by the Prophets.
<p>
<i>12 Therefore am I unto Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of Judah as rottenness.</i> 
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The suffering they will undergo, however, is not brought by human hands but by God himself.  God is the source of their punishment.  Assyria is but a mere instrument, just as the moth and rottenness are mere instruments of decay- the result of decay and not the cause.
<p>
<i>13 When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah saw his wound, then went Ephraim to Assyria, and sent to king Jareb: but he is not able to heal you, neither will he cure you of your wound.</i> 
<p>
   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To seek help from the Assyrians is a waste of time.  Nay, it is stupid.
<p>
<i>14 For I will be unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the house of Judah: I, even I, will tear and go away; I will carry off, and there shall be none to deliver. </i>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Suffering comes so that people will repent.
<p>
<i>15 I will go and return to my place, till they acknowledge their offence, and seek my face: in their affliction they will seek me earnestly. </i> 
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Still, the punishment of the people is not the end -- but the beginning of a new opportunity to return to God.  It is curious how sometimes it is necessary for people to really suffer before they will turn to God.<p>
