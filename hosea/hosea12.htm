<center><h2>Hosea 12</h2></center><p>

<i>1 Ephraim feedeth on wind, and followeth after the east wind: he continually multiplieth lies and desolation; and they make a covenant with Assyria, and oil is carried into Egypt. 2 Jehovah hath also a controversy with Judah, and will punish Jacob according to his ways; according to his doings will he recompense him. </i>
<p> 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lest, however, the Judeans believe they are exempt from punishment for sin, they too will be brought to court by God for judgment.

<i>3 In the womb he took his brother by the heel; and in his manhood he had power with God: 4 yea, he had power over the angel, and prevailed; he wept, and made supplication unto him: he found him at Beth-el, and there he spake with us, </i>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The name “Jacob” means “manipulator, deceiver, trickster”.  Here that name describes the attitudes of his descendents as well.    Of particular interest here is the chiastic structure of these verses:
	<blockquote>A-In the womb Jacob supplanted his <b>brother</b>.<br>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	B- In Adulthood he strove with <b>God</b>.<br>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	B’- He Strove with <b>God</b> and prevailed.<br>
	A’- He wept and sought his <b>brother’s</b> favor. </blockquote>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The point: that Jacob’s descendents too can learn to be right with God and man if they will but repent.  

<p>
<i>5 even Jehovah, the God of hosts; Jehovah is his memorial name. 6 Therefore turn thou to thy God: keep kindness and justice, and wait for thy God continually.  </i>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Struggle with God makes one righteous -- or destroys.
<p>
<i>7 He is a trafficker, the balances of deceit are in his hand: he loveth to oppress. 8 And Ephraim said, Surely I am become rich, I have found me wealth: in all my labors they shall find in me no iniquity that were sin. 9 But I am Jehovah thy God from the land of Egypt; I will yet again make thee to dwell in tents, as in the days of the solemn feast. </i>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ephraim is a merchant who is so greedy that he will do anything for profit.  Still, if they repent they will be restored.
<p>
<i>10 I have also spoken unto the prophets, and I have multiplied visions; and by the ministry of the prophets have I used similitudes. </i>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; God’s message.  Curiously the word translated “similitudes” or “parables” is also a word that means “ruin”.  Ruin comes to those who reject the parables spoken by the prophets and the truths those parables represent.
<p>
<i>11 Is Gilead iniquity? they are altogether false; in Gilgal they sacrifice bullocks; yea, their altars are as heaps in the furrows of the field. 12 And Jacob fled into the field of Aram, and Israel served for a wife, and for a wife he kept sheep.</i> 
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ephraim flees to foreign powers just as she flees to foreign gods.
<p>
<i>13 And by a prophet Jehovah brought Israel up out of Egypt, and by a prophet was he preserved. 14 Ephraim hath provoked to anger most bitterly: therefore shall his blood be left upon him, and his reproach shall his Lord return unto him. </i>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is known as a “bride rescue” story.  See the many examples in many world literatures.
