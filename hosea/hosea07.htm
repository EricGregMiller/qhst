<center><h2>Hosea 7</h2></center><p>

<i>1 When I would heal Israel, then is the iniquity of Ephraim uncovered, and the wickedness of Samaria; for they commit falsehood, and the thief entereth in, and the troop of robbers ravageth without. 2 And they consider not in their hearts that I remember all their wickedness: now have their own doings beset them about; they are before my face. 3 They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes with their lies. </i>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; These verses refer back again to the corrupt priests.  
<p>
<i>4 They are all adulterers; they are as an oven heated by the baker; he ceaseth to stir the fire, from the kneading of the dough, until it be leavened. </i>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The oven mentioned describes the heat resulting from their drunkenness, sexual passion, political maneuvering, and anger caused by their adulterous actions.  
<p>
<i>5 On the day of our king the princes made themselves sick with the heat of wine; he stretched out his hand with scoffers. 6 For they have made ready their heart like an oven, while they lie in wait: their baker sleepeth all the night; in the morning it burneth as a flaming fire. </i>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sleepy bakers, drowsy bakers, both symbolize people who cannot maintain attention even in the simplest matter of watching and waiting.  
<p>
<i>7 They are all hot as an oven, and devour their judges; all their kings are fallen: there is none among them that calleth unto me.  </i>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The rulers will be consumed in the oven of indifference.
<p>
<i>8 Ephraim, he mixeth himself among the peoples; Ephraim is a cake not turned. 9 Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knoweth it not: yea, gray hairs are here and there upon him, and he knoweth it not. </i>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now the scene shifts from local to international politics.  An interesting aspect of this verse is that the term “grey” should be understood as the “white hairs” of a mold’s filaments.  What is described here is mold on bread that goes unnoticed and thereby consumed!
<p>
<i>10 And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: yet they have not returned unto Jehovah their God, nor sought him, for all this. 11 And Ephraim is like a silly dove, without understanding: they call unto E   gypt, they go to Assyrill spread my net upon them; I will bring them down as the birds of the heavens; I will chastise them, as their congregation hath heard. 13 Woe unto them! for they have wandered from me; destruction unto them! for they have trespassed against me: though I would redeem them, yet they have spoken lies against me. </i>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The people are “bird brained”!  Like a silly bird they fall from the nest and are devoured by the nearest predator.
<p>
<i>14 And they have not cried unto me with their heart, but they howl upon their beds: they assemble themselves for grain and new wine; they rebel against me. 15 Though I have taught and strengthened their arms, yet do they devise mischief against me. 16 They return, but not to him that is on high; they are like a deceitful bow; their princes shall fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue: this shall be their derision in the land of Egypt. </i>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Instead of turning to God the people turn to false gods.  They turn to impotence in an effort to gain potency!!!!  Can there be anything more foolish or useless?
