<div class="SectionHead"><a name="shareware"></a>About Our Online Courses</div>
<h2>Shareware</h2>
<p>You can take any class you want, do all the work,
and you don't have to pay us a dime!</p>
<p>
Of course, if you don't pay, then you won't get a grade, you won't
get any credit, and you won't get any technical help: that is,
we won't answer any questions you might have, and you won't get
any tests to check the progress of your education.</p>
<p>
So, like shareware, if you like it, if it's useful, then why not
pay for it? It's the right thing to do.</p>
<h2>Registration and Cost</h2>
<p>Registration and payment must be made to receive credit for a
course, though a course may be taken for free for no credit. </p>

<img src="legalus.gif" alt="CCNow" style="float:left; margin: 0 1ex 1ex 0;">
<img src="shopping/pay2.gif" alt="CCNow Payment Option" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 1ex 1ex;">  
To instantly register for the course, simply click the "Pay For Course" button and you will be taken to a secure server where you can pay by credit card.  Courses are US $50.00 each.  CCNow acts as our course retailer, and so your payment to us will show up on your credit card bill as CCNow.  We will assign you a professor and he/she will contact you by email.  Assignments and exams will normally be transmitted by email, also.  Remember, text books for the courses are extra, and may be purchased through our bookstore, in association with Amazon.com.
<p>
If you would prefer to pay by personal check or money order, then just e-mail us at <a href="mailto:info@theology.edu">info@theology.edu</a> Be sure to include your name and address.  We will respond with registration materials. Return them to us
with your check or money order made out to <span class="Keyword">Quartz Hill School
of Theology</span>. Courses are <span class="Keyword">U.S. $50.00</span> each, plus the
cost of books.

<h2>Books</h2>
<p>Books may be ordered online at the our <a href="/amazon.htm">campus bookstore</a>. 
Our campus bookstore operates in association with Amazon.</p> 
<hr class="HorizontalDividerBarThinBlue">

<h2>After you register</h2>
<p>After you register you will be sent your tests. It will then
be your responsibility to find a proctor (someone to administer
and chaparone) the tests while you take them. This may be your
minister or some other professional, such as a school teacher.
</p>
<h2>Credit</h2>
<p>You can receive either CEUs (Continuing Education Units) or quarter
units if you register and pass a course. Quartz Hill School of
Theology is recognized by the Association of Christian Schools
International and is authorized to grant CEUs in Bible.</p> 
<h2>Important</h2>
<p>We are not accredited.  No institution is forced to accept credits from another – regardless of accreditation or lack thereof. It is always the prerogative of the receiving institution to determine whether and which credit will transfer. 
Thus, there is no guarantee that other
institutions will accept our units. We recommend you discuss this
issue ahead of time with any other institutions to which you may
be planning on transferring.</p>
<hr class="HorizontalDividerBarThinBlue">
<h2>Online Degrees</h2>
<p>We do not currently offer any degrees online, but we do now offer a certificate online.

Too often, by simply splitting it into Old and New Testaments,
the unity of the Bible is lost. Consequently, the Bible Survey
courses follow the pattern and classifications of the Hebrew Bible
for the Old Testament, and a new organization for the New Testament.
Each course below is designed to be completed in a single quarter
(ten weeks). Three quarter units or five CEU's may be gained for
each course taken.

Old Testament text criticism attempts to assemble and evaluate
the various readings of the Hebrew text in order to come as close
as possible to what was originally written.
