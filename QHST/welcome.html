<p>Quartz Hill School of Theology is an academic institution designed to
train believers for more effective ministry, both in and out of the church.
QHST affirms that each believer is a priest before God, indwelt by the
Holy Spirit, not needing any human intermediary to reach God and competent
to judge spiritual matters for him or herself.
