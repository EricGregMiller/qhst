  <b><font size=5>A Reaction to the Article<br>
  "John 1:1c - English translation: 'The Word was <u>a god</u>.'
  "</font></b><br>
</div>
<br>
<b><font size=5>Prologue</font></b><br>
<br>
<a href="jw.html">The article</a> to which I am responding came to me without reference information. I
do not know who the author is. Repeatedly calling it "the article" is awkward
and confusing, especially since I am dealing with Greek and English articles. To
help clarity and understanding I choose to call it the "John Prologue Article"
which this paper refers to simply as "JPA." It is customary to refer to the
author of an article when quoting. Without author information I also use "JPA"
to refer to the author. I do not know the gender of the author. Calling the
author "it" is confusing, so I picked a gender: female. For example, I might say
something like, "JPA says Origen supports her view. In doing so she
misunderstands Origen."<br>
<br>
JPA was sent to me as coming from a Jehovah's Witness group, so I at times make
reference to the Witnesses in my response.<br>
<br>
The New Testament was written in a dialect of Greek called "Koine." I use the
terms "Greek" and "Koine" to refer to the language of the New Testament.<br>
<br>
When writing Greek I use Unicode Greek (using the Microsoft Windows language
facility). This avoids having to refer to a specific font. The Microsoft Unicode
Greek is oriented toward modern Greek so it is not easy to produce the Koine
accents and breathing marks. For this reason they are not included. I believe
this is not a problem since most of the Koine is referenced. The proper
accenting and breathing of unreferenced Koine should obvious to those who know
enough to care.<br>
<br>
JPA's level of scholarship swings wildly. One the one hand she writes about
subjects normally only discussed in advanced language and seminary classes. On
the other hand she talks as if instructing young believers. To answer all of
JPA's arguments I must refer to somewhat advanced Greek and linguistic concepts.
I understand that non-seminarians and non-Greek scholars may also be interested.
With this in mind I try to explain grammatical concepts as much as possible. I
also give some sort of English for every Greek term I use.<br>
<br>
English Scripture references are taken from the New International Version. Greek
searches were done using BibleWorks software. Greek text used in this paper is
from BibleWorks and the Unbound Bible (unbound.biola.edu). In both cases I
believe it is the same or very close to the current United Bible Societies text.<br>
<br>
<b><font size=5>Overview</font></b><br>
<br>
Rules are often good, but we also often create too many rules. Our life is more
than rules. I am married. One of the "rules" of marriage is that I'm faithful to
my wife. I make it a rule to wear my ring as much as possible. I provide for
myself and my family. These are all good things, but they are not the entire
marriage. It is not just a business partnership. It's a relationship. My wife
doesn't want me to just follow the rules. She wants to be involved in my life.
And I want to be in hers.<br>
<br>
Likewise with my (now grown) children. I want them to follow my rules, to be
morally upright and to treat their mother and myself well. But that's not what I
really want. I want a relationship. To talk and learn how they are feeling. To
share my feelings.<br>
<br>
God wants the same of us. He loves us. He wants a relationship with us. It's
actually mind-blowing -- the God of Creation wants to know us and let us know
him. Like any good relationship there are rules. But the rules are not the
relationship. I have heard it said that religion is our attempt to keep God at
arm's length. We go to church and pay our tithe so God will stay off our back
for another week. If we're really spiritual we attend church many times a week
and even work for the church so God will be happy with our efforts. All the time
what God really wants is to get to know us and us to know him. For us to read
his word, not to prove a theological point, but to understand him as a person.
He would have us pray, not as a religious rite or as a way to get stuff done,
but to share ourselves with him.<br>
<br>
Why do I say this and why do I bring it up here? I believe we religious people
often forget this. It is relevant here because language is like this. It is more
than just a bunch of rules. We cannot just memorize 500 rules and know Greek (or
any other language). I have been a part of a group that translates Bibles around
the world, trying to reach people who speak the thousands of unwritten
languages. I've been told that they regularly get letters offering to help. The
offer is often something like "If you'll just send me a dictionary for a
language, I can help translate." Such letters show a tremendous
misunderstanding. Part of it is that no dictionary exists for unwritten
languages. However, the bigger mis-comprehension is that translation is as
simple as matching words between languages. The words don't have a one-to-one
match. It's just as simplistic to expect some sort of one-to-one grammatical
match, or to be able to reduce the grammar of a language to simple rules.<br>
<br>
I speak English. I know what to say not because I studied and know all the rules
(although I have done a lot of that). I know what to say because I've spoken it
for the better part of 50 years. I know what sounds right and what doesn't. I
can tell when someone is not a native speaker of English. Even if they have a
very good command of the language, they get little things wrong. Some of those
things I can explain the rule for. Some I cannot.<br>
<br>
One of the hardest things for non-native speakers of English to understand is
the use of the article, especially the definite article. I can hear when they
get it wrong. I cannot provide a rule for them in most cases. They just need to
hear it enough and learn when to use the article and when not. There are no
simple rules. As far as I know, there are no rules that fully cover the usage of
articles in the English language.<br>
<br>
None of us is a native speaker of Koine Greek. We make rules to help us learn
and understand what the language is saying. But we should be careful with the
rules. Those of us who have studied realize that the Greek article, like the
English article, is very hard to understand. We need to read lots of Greek to
get a feel for it. We need to do a lot of study, to look at a lot of evidence.<br>
<br>
I wrote many words above just to make this point, but I believe it was worth it.
It's not that I know the right rules and Jehovah's Witnesses (or any other
group) have the wrong rules. Neither is the opposite true. What is true is that
we need to approach the use of the language scientifically. Gather lots of
evidence. Make hypotheses. Change our mind when proved wrong. Be open to new
ways of thinking. With this mindset we can all slowly arrive at the truth,
rather than just argue to prove our preconceived theology.<br>
<br>
<b><font size=5>Arguments Presented By JPA.</font></b><br>
<br>
<b>Methodology</b><br>
<br>
JPA raises a couple of good points. However the methods she uses are often bad.
If, as I write above, our goal is to come to a mutual understanding of the
truth, we must use honest scholarship. We cannot use false methods and hope to
make progress. Here are the methodological problems I see in JPA.<br>
<ol>
  <li>
    It makes statements with no support for them.
  </li>
  <li>
    It attributes ideas to people without adequate references.
  </li>
  <li>
    It uses references to support ideas that the text referenced to disagrees
    with.
  </li>
  <li>
    It promotes using English translations to do Greek grammatical analysis.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<br>
Problems 1-3 deal with fair arguing practices. I point out the specifics of
these flaws when I comment on JPA's argument below.<br>
<br>
Problem 4 is a problem in how to study and analyze Greek. It seems to be
included in JPA as a way to show the reader how to learn about Greek, rather
than as part of the logical structure of the argument. For this reason I do not
address it in my comments on the argument. I comment here.<br>
<br>
Looking at English translations can be helpful. After all, most translations
were done by smart people who knew Greek. We should pay attention to what they
think. However, that should not be the primary way of looking at Greek. In fact,
such an approach has a serious problem. Instead of learning Greek as Greek, the
tendency is to learn how to put Greek into English. The two are not the same. We
are not trying to learn translation rules (as I talk about above), we are trying
to learn how a Greek writer expresses what she means. We must do our analysis in
Greek to really learn what the Greek is saying.<br>
<br>
<b>Trinitarianism</b><br>
<br>
JPA often uses "trinitarian" and related terms. Strictly speaking the doctrine
of the trinity is outside of the scope of this paper and JPA. The doctrine of
the trinity asserts that the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit are all God.
John 1:1 only speaks to the divinity of the Son. That said, I accept JPA's usage
of "trinitarian." as one who believe Jesus is God. Jesus' divinity is much more
discussed than that of the Holy Spirit. For example,
<a href=http://www.theology.edu/apologetics/trinity.htm>Nettelhorst and
McWilliams</a> write an excellent paper on the doctrine of the Trinity
(http://www.theology.edu/apologetics/trinity.htm). It spends the majority of its
time discussing Jesus' divinity and answering critics' (especially Jehovah's
Witnesses) objections.<br>
<br>
<b>The Argument</b><br>
<br>
I found JPA confusing, especially with the comments about how to study using
English translations interspersed among the arguments. For this reason I restate
JPA's arguments more clearly, ignoring the explanations of how to study. This
also provides a clear statement of what I understand JPA to say and allows
others to point out my flaws and misunderstandings of JPA. JPA divides much of
her paper into sections using capital letter A through S. However, she often
uses multiple sections for a single argument and she adds arguments that are not
under any lettered section. It reforming JPA's arguments I tried, where
possible, to link my points to the lettered sections of JPA.<br>

<br>
<b><font size=5>Comments and Answers to The Argument<br>
</font></b><br>
<b>1. (JPA A-C) θεος (god) used "alone" in the nominative singular always means
"a god."</b><br>
<br>
English has a definite and indefinite article. Greek has only one article. It is
usually thought of as a definite article but this is not strictly true. As with
any language the Greek article must be understood in the context of the Greek
language (see, for example, Mounce, Basics of Biblical Greek, Chapter 6). The
Greek word θεος (god) in John 1:1c does not have the article. The technical term
for this is anarthrous. All of JPA's grammatical argument are centered around
this fact.<br>
<br>
Nominative is a Greek case normally used as a subject. It can also be used as a
predicate with the "to be" verb (copula) and some similar verbs. This is called
a predicate nominative, often abbreviated PN (Basics of Biblical Greek, Chapters
6 and 8). Θεος (god) in John 1:1c is a PN.<br>
<br>
JPA is saying that whenever θεος (god) is in the nominative case, is singular
and does not have and article ("alone") it always means "a god." Her statement
is made without support. It is also wrong. I searched for all anarthrous and
unmodified uses of θεος (god) in the nominative singular. The only such use I
found in the Gospel of John is in John 1:1c. That is not much of a data set!
Looking at the rest of the NT I found:<br>
<ul>
  <li>
    2 Corinthians 5:19 οτι θεος ην εν Χριστω -- "that God was in Christ..."
  </li>
  <li>
    Galatians 6:7 θεος ου μυκτηριζεται -- "God cannot be mocked.
  </li>
  <li>
    Philippians 2:13 θεος γαρ εστιν ο ενεργων -- "For it is God who works..."
  </li>
  <li>
    1 Thessalonians 2:5 θεος μαρτυς -- "God is witness"
  </li>
  <li>
    2 Thessalonians 2:4 οτι εστιν θεος -- literally "that I am God." In context
    it is translated "proclaiming himself to be God."
  </li>
  <li>
    Hebrews 3:4 ο δε παντα κατασκευασας θεος -- "God is the builder of
    everything"
  </li>
</ul>
<br>
I never see it translated "a god." 2 Thessalonians 2:4 is interesting because it
is very similar to John 1:1. At first glance it might seem possible to translate
it as "a god." However, the passage is talking about the "man of lawlessness"
who sets himself above God. This could only mean he thinks he is God, not a god.<br>
<br>
2. <b>(D,E,G,H,J-N) To parallel John 1:1 requires "a single non-abstract,
unmodified, singular predicate noun without a definite article coming before the
verb and a single non-abstract, unmodified noun (or pronoun) used as a subject
coming after the verb." All such constructions in John's Gospel show an
indefinite meaning.</b><br>
<br>
Here JPA claims that many restrictions are necessary for another passage to
parallel John 1:1c. The problem is that it is not at all clear why these
particular restrictions are necessary. It is also not clear why there should not
be others.<br>
<br>
The proper study of grammar is very scientific. Linguists look at a lot of
passage and try to see trends. When they think they see a trend they make a
hypothesis. Then they try to exhaustively look at all the relevant and clear
passages to see if their hypothesis is correct. If it is it can used as a rule
to understand passages which are not as clear.<br>
<br>
A major source of disagreement is that grammarians are only human and it is
difficult to find all the relevant passages. Modern computer aids have helped
somewhat in this. Another problem is that it is not always clear exactly what is
important.<br>
<br>
Therefore, when JPA lists these exact restrictions are necessary she must
provide plenty of textual evidence to support her claim. She provides none. She
does provide passages that match her restrictions, but that does not prove her
initial claim that those are the only passages that are relevant.<br>
<br>
We could ask "Why only the Gospel of John?" Yes, it is best to look at the same
writing when doing comparative analysis. However, when data is limited it is
good to look at other writings by the same author, the rest of the New Testament
and at times non-biblical Koine. It is clear from JPA's three or four examples
that the data is very limited and so we would want to look at other Koine
examples. Another question might be, "Why does the subject need to be a
non-abstract, unmodified noun (or pronoun)?" We would need passages show why
this conditions makes a difference. We could even ask, "Why not restrict the
subject to having the article?" The subject of John 1:1c has the article. Why is
it OK to ignore this but make so many other restrictions?<br>
<br>
JPA also mentions a difference between types of words. She says "god" falls into
the same category as "word" and "house." For each word in her first category you
can make them plural and use articles ("a god, the God, gods, a word, the word,
words, a house, the house, houses") She then says other words, like "pretty,"
"holy" and "true" are not like that. At this point JPA is very unclear and to me
shows a complete lack of grammar knowledge. All the words in her first category
are nouns. All the words in her second are adjectives. Nouns and adjectives do
not compare -- they fulfill different grammatical functions. Furthermore even
JPA's basic statement is wrong. There are times in English when we can use an
article with an adjective. One of my favorite Clint Eastwood movies is titled
"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly." If I use JPA's words I would say "The Pretty,
the Holy and the True" (but it would be a very different movie!). This usage
treats an adjective as a noun -- the noun is only known from context (I've seen
the movie so I know the title refers to a good man, a bad man and an ugly man.
Without knowing the context of the title, which is the movie it could refer to
women, or children, or cats or even computer programs.). In English using
adjectives as if they are nouns is rare. In Greek it happens often. All first
year Greek students should learn this (for example, Basics of Biblical Greek,
Chapter 9, especially pp. 64-66).<br>
<br>
One of JPA's conditions is that the nouns be non-abstract, so perhaps she was
trying to distinguish concrete nouns (house, cat, dog) from abstract nouns
(beauty, holiness and truth). The trouble with doing this is that such
distinctions sometimes break down. Λογος (word) in Greek can be both abstract
and concrete. "God" in both English and Greek can be both as well. Worse, "a
god" and "God" have a different meaning as I explain under Argument 8 below.<br>
<br>
JPA uses the phase "indefinite meaning." I want to clarify what she is saying.
When a noun is used it can have three types of meaning: indefinite, definite and
qualitative. When a noun is used indefinitely it refer to one member of a class
(Wallace, Greek Grammar Beyond the Basics, p. 244) "A man spoke to an
assembly."&nbsp; means some male member of the human race spoke to some
assembly. Nouns used definitely lay the stress on individual identity (Wallace,
p. 245). "President Bush spoke to Congress." identifies both the man and the
assembly. Nouns used qualitatively stress quality, nature or essence (Wallace,
p. 244). "God is love." stresses that God has the quality of love. JPA's
"indefinite meaning" statement takes John 1:1c to mean that the Word (λογος) is
just a member of a class of gods. Some trinitarians believe θεος (god) is
definite -- the word is the one true God. Some trinitarians, myself included,
believe θεος (god) in John 1:1c is qualitative -- the Word has the essence of
God. Every quality true of God is also true of the Word.<br>
<br>
Notice that the core of the disagreement over John 1:1c is the meaning of the
passage, not the translation. The translation often closely follows from the
meaning, but the two are not identical. I believe John 1:1c is qualitative. It
could be translated "the Word was divine." This can be confusing, especially
with the modern use of divine to refer to something really good ("That chocolate
was simply divine.") Saying "the Word has all the essence and qualities of God"
is wordy and strays from the Greek. Simple saying "the Word was God" does not
distinguish from the definite meaning. You can see that one meaning can does not
dictate a single translation. (I prefer the traditional "the Word was God" and
don't mind explaining the subtleties if someone is really interested.<br>
<br>
JPA provides three sample verses that meet her restrictions. (They could be
called four examples because JPA cites two passages from John 18:37.) JPA's
restriction statement correctly deals with the meaning of the passage. However,
when she deals with her examples all she does is use translations to prove her
point. Let's examine each JPA example verse for its meaning.<br>
<ul>
  <li>
    John 4:19 προφητης ει συ "You are a prophet." Wallace calls this the "most
    likely candidate" for an indefinite, pre-verbal predicate nominative (PN).
    This probably is indefinite as JPA asserts.
  </li>
  <li>
    John 8:48 Σαμαριτης ει συ "You are a Samaritan" This could be indefinite but
    is more probably qualitative. The Jews were focused on showing Jesus was
    evil. They would be looking at the attributes of a Samaritan, not whether
    Jesus was physically a member of the Samaritan race (which he wasn't). When
    the focus is on the attributes or qualities conveyed by the noun it should
    be taken as qualitative, not indefinite.
  </li>
  <li>
    John 18:37 βασιλευς ει συ ... βασιλευς ειμι "You are a king ... I am a king"
    The charge brought to Pilate against Jesus was that he called himself the
    King of the Jews (Luke 23:2). Pilate knew this as shown by his question in
    verse 33 "Are you the King of the Jews?" and the inscription he put on the
    cross (John 19:19-22). Pilate is not asking Jesus whether he is some
    indefinite king. He is asking about whether he is King of the Jews. This
    would be a definite usage because of the context. Jesus is answering in kind
    so his answer is also definite -- though I suspect he is saying he is king
    of much more than the physical Jewish province Pilate was worried about.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<br>
So, of JPA's three (or four) examples, one is indefinite, one is qualitative and
one (or two) are definite. This is not good support for her position. Her use of
translation as proof instead of the meaning obscures the data.<br>
<br>
JPA also misses some relevant verses. In addition to the verses JPA lists I also
found these.<br>
<ul>
  <li>
    John 5:10 σαββατον εστιν -- "It is the Sabbath"
  </li>
  <li>
    John 6:63 πνευμα εστιν και ζωη εστιν -- "He is spirit and he is life."
  </li>
  <li>
    John 19:31 παρασκευει ην -- "It was the day of preparation."
  </li>
  <li>
    John 20:14 Ιησοθς εστιν -- "It was Jesus"
  </li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>
  John 5:10 and John 19:31 are both not indefinite. I would take John 5:10 as
  qualitative (since they are focused on the quality of the day -- Jesus
  violated the day of rest). I would take John 19:31 as definite -- they are
  looking at a particular day of the passover week. Clearly neither is
  indefinite. They are also both translated with the English definite article,
  contrary to JPA's assertion.<br>
</p>
<p>
  <br>
</p>
<p>
  It could be argued that John 6:63 uses abstract nouns "spirit" and "life" and
  so does not meet JPA's restrictions. However, I could also argue the same
  about θεος (god) in John 1:1c, which would mean even John 1:1c does not meet
  JPA's restrictions. Assuming θεος (god) is non-abstract in John 1:1c begs the
  question. That is the Jehovah Witness position is that θεος (god) should be
  non-abstract "a god" One of the other positions is that θεος (god) in John
  1:1c is qualitative and thus abstract, indicating a quality. In this case it
  would be exactly like John 6:63.
</p>
<p>
  <br>
</p>
In John 20:14 the noun is a name so JPA might argue that it is not similar to
John 1:1c. However, to state it is different than John 1:1 requires proof. To
just state the restriction again begs the question. If John 1:1c has a definite
meaning then θεος (god) would have a name like quality. Θεος (god) would be used
in the same way Jehovah Witnesses use "Jehovah."<br>
<br>
<b>3. (F) Dana &amp; Mantey (p. 148) gives a parallel to John 1:1 which
translates "the place was a market"</b><br>
<br>
JPA does not specify what Dana and Mantey's parallel is. It turns out the
parallel is not from the Bible. From page 148 of Dana &amp; Mantey we find out
that the reference is from Xenophon's Anabasis, 1:4:6. Thus far JPA has strongly
insisted on only using examples from the Gospel of John. She does not what us to
even use other writings of John or other Gospel, let alone the rest of the New
Testament or other Koine sources. Now she sites an example that is not even
Koine but classical Greek! Classical Greek is much more formal Greek that was
used by most of the famous Greek writers. It was used many centuries before
Christ and was considered elegant and formal, much as we often revere King James
English. The word <i>koine</i> means "common." Koine was the common trade
language in the time of Jesus. Classical Greek and Koine can have many
similarities but often do not compare.<br>
<br>
Nevertheless, lets look at Dana and Mantey's comparison. They say the parallel
of Xenophon's Anabasis, 1:4:6 with John 1:1c is that "The article points out the
subject." This is the main point, not the lack of article in the predicate.
Furthermore, they continue. "Neither was <i>the place</i> the only market, nor
was <i>the word</i> all of God, as it would mean if the article were also used
with θεος (god). As it stands the other persons of the Trinity may be implied in
θεος (god)." Dana and Mantey do not compare Xenophon's passage to show that John
1:1c should be translated "a god." JPA should not quote them as agreeing with
her argument.<br>
<br>
<b>4. (I) Various grammar books agree that the noun must be without additional
phases.</b><br>
<br>
JPA claims three grammar books support her view that a PN noun must be without
additional phrases to be a parallel to John 1:1c. One of these is "C. F. D.
Moule, A Grammar of New Testament Greek, 2nd ed., Cambridge University Press." I
am not familiar with this book. I searched the Library of Congress, Amazon and
The Master's Semimany Library (where I received my M. Div) and could not find
it. The closest I could find for Moule was: Moule, C. F. D. (Charles Francis
Digby), An Idiom Book of New Testament Greek. Cambridge [Eng] University Press,
1953 (Library of Congress Control No. 53013295). I also found a grammar by
Moulton: Moulton, James Hope, A Grammar of New Testament Greek. Edinburgh : T.
&amp; T. Clark, 1906- (LC Control No. 07013420). I cannot speak to this
apparently non-existent book.<br>
<br>
A second book JPA cites is Dana and Mantey, p. 137. JPA does not indicate a
specific quote on page 137. Perhaps JPA she is thinking of this: "The use of
prepositions, possessive and demonstrative pronouns, and the genitive case also
tends to make a word definite. At such times, even if the article is not used,
the object is already distinctly indicated." First, Dana and Mantey do not
exclude the dative and accusative nor apposition as JPA does. So JPA is being
too restrictive. For example, John 10:33 uses anarthrous θεον (god, accusative
singular form) to refer to God. (JPA cites John 10:33 regarding ανθρωπος (man)
and I comment on it under Argument 8 below.) Second, JPA ignores the immediately
preceding quote of A. T. Robertson "Whenever the article occurs the object is
certainly definite. When it is not used the object may or may not be." JPA also
ignores the statement in Section i "It does more than mark 'the object as one
definitely conceived' (W. 105), for a substantive in Greek is definite without
the article." These do not speak directly to Argument 4, but they do indicate
that Dana and Mantey and Robertson think that Greek nouns can be definite even
without the article.<br>
<br>
The third book JPA cites has long been held as the standard of Koine grammars:
Robertson, A. T., A Grammar of the Greek New Testament in the Light of
Historical Research. I don't have easy access to the print version of the book,
but have read the relevant passages before. A good article on the web
(<a href=http://www.aomin.org/JOHN1_1.html>http://www.aomin.org/JOHN1_1.html</a>)
has an extended passage about what A. T. Robertson writes. It agrees with what I
know of Robertson so I reproduce that passage here.<br>
<br>
<blockquote style=MARGIN-LEFT:40px>
  <p>
    I begin with the most quoted scholar on this subject, <b>Dr. A. T.
    Robertson</b>:
  </p>
  <blockquote style=MARGIN-LEFT:40px>
    <p>
      And the Word was God (<i>kai theos en ho logos</i>). By exact and careful
      language John denied Sabellianism by not saying <i>ho theos en ho
      logos</i>. That would mean that all of God was expressed in <i>ho
      logos</i> and the terms would be interchangeable, each having the article.
      The subject is made plain by the article (<i>ho logos</i>) and the
      predicate without it (<i>theos</i>) just as in John 4:24 <i>pneuma ho
      theos</i> can only mean "God is spirit," not "spirit is God." So in 1 John
      4:16 <i>ho theos agape estin</i> can only mean "God is love," not "love is
      God" as a so-called Christian scientist would confusedly say. For the
      article with the predicate see Robertson, Grammar, pp. 767f. So in John
      1:14 <i>ho Logos sarx egeneto</i>, "the Word became flesh," not "the flesh
      became Word." Luther argues that here John disposes of Arianism also
      because the Logos was eternally God, fellowship of the Father and Son,
      what Origen called the Eternal Generation of the Son (each necessary to
      the other). Thus in the Trinity we see personal fellowship on an equality.
      (A. T. Robertson, Word Pictures in the New Testament, vol. 5, pp. 4-5.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    As Robertson made reference to his voluminous Grammar in the above
    quotation, I will include it in its entirety:
  </p>
  <blockquote style=MARGIN-LEFT:40px>
    <p>
      The word with the article is then the subject, whatever the order may be.
      So in Jo. 1:1, <i>theos an ho logos</i>, the subject is perfectly clear.
      Cf. <i>ho logos sarx egeneto</i> (Jo. 1:14). It is true that ho <i>theos
      an ho logos</i> (convertible terms) would have been Sabellianism. See also
      <i>ho theos agape estin</i> (1 Jo.4:16). "God" and "love" are not
      convertible terms any more than "God" and "Logos" or "Logos" and "flesh."
      Cf. also <i>hoi theristai angeloi eisin</i> (Mt. 13:39), <i>ho logos ho
      sos alatheia estin</i> (Jo. 17:17), <i>ho nomos hamartia</i>; (Ro. 7:7).
      The absence of the article here is on purpose and essential to the true
      idea. (A. T. Robertson, A Grammar of the Greek New Testament in the Light
      of Historical Research, (Nashville: Broadman Press, 1934) p. 767-768.)
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Note that Robertson translates the phrase, "the Word was God." His argument
    is summed up well in the following passage:
  </p>
  <blockquote style=MARGIN-LEFT:40px>
    <p>
      A word should be said concerning the use and non-use of the article in
      John 1:1, where a narrow path is safely followed by the author. "The Word
      was God." It both God and Word were articular, they would be coextensive
      and equally distributed and so interchangeable. But the separate
      personality of the Logos is affirmed by the construction used and
      Sabellianism is denied. If God were articular and Logos non-articular, the
      affirmation would be that God was Logos, but not that the Logos was God.
      As it is, John asserts that in the Pre-incarnate state the Logos was God,
      though the Father was greater than the Son (John 14:28). The Logos became
      flesh (1:14), and not the Father. But the Incarnate Logos was really "God
      only Begotten in the bosom of the Father" (1:18 correct text). (A. T.
      Robertson, The Minister and His Greek New Testament, (Grand Rapids: Baker
      Book House, 1977) pp. 67-68.)
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <br>
  In light of Dr. Robertson's comments, it is indeed unbelievable that some will
  quote from the above section and try to intimate that Robertson felt that
  Jesus was less than the Father because he quoted John 14:28. A quick look at
  his comments on John 14:28 in Word Pictures in the New Testament, volume 5,
  page 256 refutes this idea.<br>
  <br>
  To recap, Robertson says that 1) the translation of the phrase <i>theos en ho
  logos</i> is "the Word was God." 2) That the anarthrous <i>theos</i> is
  required for the meaning. If the article were present, this would teach
  Sabellianism, as then theos and logos would be convertible terms. 3) That the
  article before logos serves to point out the subject of the clause.

<br>
Many years ago I was at a fast food place with my then young family. A Jehovah's
Witness walked up and began a discussion. When he ran into trouble his friend
came over. The friend said that A. T. Robertson writes that John 1:1 needs the
article to make the Word equal to God. That disturbed me so I went to my school
library and looked up A. T. Robertson's grammar book. I found the same thing as
what I've quoted above. John is not saying the Word is exactly equal to God,
that they are interchangeable. That would be Modallism or Sabellianism, which
says that God took on different modes at different times: 1) The Father in the
Old Testament; 2) The Son while Jesus was alive; and 3) The Holy Spirit after
Jesus died. God does not change modes. He always is Father, Son and Holy Spirit.
Having the article before θεος (God) would be very wrong.<br>
<br>
My research really opened my eyes. First, I was impressed at how easily people
can not only twist Scripture but also twist what others say about Scripture.
Second, my understanding of Koine, Christian theology and the brilliance of what
John wrote grew dramatically. It suddenly became clear to me why John <i>could
not</i> include the article before θεος (god). The presence of the article would
<i>not</i> be the trinitarian position! John had to leave the article out! He
had no other choice. I believe that if you understand this one fact about Koine
and John 1:1 you will know that it is impossible to translate John 1:1c as "the
Word was a god." Personally I'm still amused at the irony of me receiving one of
my deepest insights into the deity of Christ because of a conversation with a
Jehovah's Witness.<br>
<br>
Finally, I have only dealt with the grammars referred to by JPA.
<a href=http://www.theology.edu/apologetics/trinity.htm>Nettelhorst and
McWilliams</a> give a comprehensive list of quotes from various grammarians,
many that are abused by Jehovah's Witnesses. It is worth reading just to see the
weight of support for the traditional interpretation and how their words can be
twisted.<br>
<br>
<b>5. ( O,P) Many early Christians support this reading and call other holy
people "gods." </b><br>
<br>
JPA claims that many early Christian writings, including Athanasius and
Augustine, call "Other righteous persons and faithful angels" "gods" or "a god."
However, JPA does not give a single reference for this claim. I thus ignore the
argument.<br>
<br>
JPA also claims that Origen translates John 1:1c as "the Word was a god." She
cites "Origen's Commentary on John," Book I, Chapter 42 and Book II, Chapter 3.
I don't have a written copy of Origen's works. I looked it up online and found
this site:
<a href=http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/origen.html>http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/origen.html</a>.<br>
<br>
In Book I, chapter 42 I did not find anything about John 1:1c meaning "the Word
was a god." I did find this passage near the end of the chapter: "We must
observe, then, that the Logos is in the beginning, that is, in wisdom, always.
Its being in wisdom, which is called the beginning, does not prevent it from
being with God and from being God, and it is not simply with God, but is in the
beginning, in wisdom, with God." Sounds to me like Origen is saying the Logos
always existed and is God.<br>
<br>
In Book II, Chapter 2 Origen has an extended discussion on the nature of the
Word (Logos) as God. It is not too long so I quote the entire chapter here. I
highlighted some significant passages.<br>
<br>
<blockquote style=MARGIN-LEFT:40px>
  "We next notice John's use of the article in these sentences. He does not
  write without care in this respect, nor is he unfamiliar with the niceties of
  the Greek tongue. In some cases he uses the article, and in some he omits it.
  He adds the article to the Logos, but to the name of God he adds it sometimes
  only. <span style=COLOR:#ff0000>He uses the article, when the name of God
  refers to the uncreated cause of all things, and omits it when the Logos is
  named God.</span> Does the same difference which we observe between God with
  the article and God without it prevail also between the Logos with it and
  without it? We must enquire into this. As the God who is over all is God with
  the article not without it, so "the Logos" is the source of that reason
  (Logos) which dwells in every reasonable creature; the reason which is in each
  creature is not, like the former called par excellence The Logos.
  <span style=COLOR:#ff0000>Now there are many who are sincerely concerned about
  religion, and who fall here into great perplexity. They are afraid that they
  may be proclaiming two Gods, and their fear drives them into doctrines which
  are false and wicked. Either they deny that the Son has a distinct nature of
  His own besides that of the Father, and make Him whom they call the Son to be
  God all but the name, or they deny the divinity of the Son, giving Him a
  separate existence of His own, and making His sphere of essence fall outside
  that of the Father, so that they are separable from each other.</span> To such
  persons we have to say that God on the one hand is Very God (Autotheos, God of
  Himself); and so the Saviour says in His prayer to the Father, "That they may
  know Thee the only true God; "but that all beyond the Very God is made God by
  participation in His divinity, and is not to be called simply God (with the
  article), but rather God (without article). And thus the first-born of all
  creation, who is the first to be with God, and to attract to Himself divinity,
  is a being of more exalted rank than the other gods beside Him, of whom God is
  the God, as it is written, "The God of gods, the Lord, hath spoken and called
  the earth." It was by the offices of the first-born that they became gods, for
  He drew from God in generous measure that they should be made gods, and He
  communicated it to them according to His own bounty. The true God, then, is
  "The God," and those who are formed after Him are gods, images, as it were, of
  Him the prototype. <span style=COLOR:#ff0000>But the archetypal image, again,
  of all these images is the Word of God, who was in the beginning, and who by
  being with God is at all times God,</span> not possessing that of Himself, but
  by His being with the Father, and not continuing to be God, if we should think
  of this, except by remaining always in uninterrupted contemplation of the
  depths of the Father."<br>
</blockquote>
<br>
OK, I'll admit I'm a bit confused by everything Origen is saying. He says that
fear drives some into false doctrine so that they "deny the divinity of the
Son." He then talks about the first-born as having "other gods beside him" which
sound like he sees Jesus as one of many gods. However, right after that he
affirms that the Word "is at all times God." Confusing but Origen repeatedly
calls the Word God.<br>
<br>
In Book II, Chapter 3 Origen seems to be defending his just stated belief in
other gods. Chapter 3 begins "Now it is possible that some may dislike what we
have said representing the Father as the one true God, but admitting other
beings besides the true God, who have become gods by having a share of God." He
again seems to affirm that the Logos is God: "Each fills the place of a
fountain--the Father is the fountain of divinity, the Son of reason. As, then,
there are many gods, but to us there is but one God the Father, and many Lords,
but to us there is one Lord, Jesus Christ, so there are many <i>Lgoi</i>, but
we, for our part, pray that that one <i>Lgos</i>; may be with us who was in the
beginning and was with God, God the Logos."<br>
<br>
Later in Chapter 3 Origen says this "And, again, there was the Logos with the
article and the Logos without the article, corresponding to God absolutely and a
god; and the Logoi in two ranks." Perhaps this is what JPA is referring to. I
don't know since JPA does not give a specific reference, only the entire
chapter. Again I am not sure what Origen means by this. It is clear to me that
even in this statement he talks of the Logos corresponding to God absolutely.<br>
<br>
I agree that Origen brings in the idea of many lesser gods. He also at times
seems to say that God without the article is a lesser god. Nonetheless he
clearly affirms that the Logos is God many times. I would not cite Origen as a
strong supporter of the trinitarian position. However, I also do not see any way
to say he supports the "a god" translation.<br>
<br>
Once again I have only dealt with the writings JPA references.
<a href=http://www.theology.edu/apologetics/trinity.htm>Nettelhorst and
McWilliams</a> give a long list of quotes from early Christians showing what
they thought of the trinity and the deity of Christ.<br>
<br>
<b>6. (Q,R) Philo views λογος (word) as "the Son of God," "with God" and "a
god." but not the true God. </b><br>
<br>
JPA claims that many that Jewish people in the time of Christ viewed λογος
(word, transliterated "logos") as "the Son of God," "with God" and "a god" but
not the true God. She says the writings of Philo support this. I do not know
Philo so I can't comment in from personal knowledge. JPA gives no reference so
again there is no way I can specifically respond to her argument.<br>
<br>
As part of this argument JPA asserts "The fact that John provided no further
explanation of the Word ('Logos') proves that he intended the Logos concept that
his readers were already familiar with." First of all, it is not true that John
"provided no further explanation of the Word." Just a verse away John 1:3 says
"All things came into being by Him, and apart from Him nothing came into being
that has come into being." John 1:3 says that the Word is the creator of
everything. From Genesis 1 we know that God is the one creator of everything. To
a Jew and anyone else who believes Genesis, this means that the Word is God.<br>
<br>
Even if John had not provided a nearby explanation, JPA's is wrong when she
asserts that John "intended the Logos concept that his readers were already
familiar with.". It is common for writers to begin with a general assertion and
then provide details later. Let's try JPA's assertion for Genesis 1. The
Israelites of Moses' time were coming out of Egypt. They would have held an
Egyptian view of God (or gods). Egyptians had no central God, only a bunch of
regional gods. When Moses went up Mount Sinai most of the Israelites were happy
to worship a calf. They obviously held completely false views of God. Yet
Genesis 1:1 just introduces God without explanation: "In the beginning God
created the heavens and the earth." So by JPA's logic the writer of Genesis
intends his readers to think that God is a calf! Of course this is ridiculous.
The rest of Genesis and the Pentateuch describe who God really is. Likewise John
makes a general introduction and spends the rest of the book explaining and
illustrating.<br>
<br>
I did try to find some data on Philo by searching the internet. I found an
article on Wikipedia
(<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philo%27s_view_of_God>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philo's_view_of_God</a>).
Under the "Logos" section it says "Philo considers these divine powers in their
totality also, treating them as a single independent being, which he designates
'Logos'." The Wikipedia article also says Philo drew from Heraclitus, Stoicism
and Plato. Regarding the relation of the Logos to God he believed "The Logos is
a kind of shadow cast by God, having the outlines but not the blinding light of
the Divine Being." When JPA makes its "no further explanation" assertion it
implies John agrees with Philo that Logos is the divine shadow and holds the
totality of divine power. Is this really the Jehovah Witness position? That
would be new to me. Does the rest of the Gospel of John and the rest of the New
Testament affirm this position? No they do not.<br>
<br>
For what it's worth, I believe John deliberately chose λογος (word) to confront
both his Jewish and Hellenistic readers and challenge their philosophies. He,
like Jesus, chose provocative words, words designed to surprise his readers and
shake up their beliefs. Apparently it worked -- Jesus was crucified, John was
exiled and Christians were often persecuted and misunderstood.<br>
<br>
<b>7. (S) In John 17:1,3 Jesus says ""Father,.... This is eternal life: to know
thee who alone art truly God..." </b><br>
<br>
JPA's throws in a quote from John 17:1,3: "Father, ... This is eternal life: to
know thee who alone art truly God...". She says this shows that Jesus is not
God. I assume JPA's argument is this:<br>
<ol>
  <li>
    Jesus says that the Father alone is God.
  </li>
  <li>
    Therefore nobody else is God.
  </li>
  <li>
    Therefore Jesus is not God.
  </li>
</ol>
<br>
This, strictly speaking, is not an argument about John 1:1c, the subject of JPA.
Nonetheless, it is an interesting assertion and deserves an answer.<br>
<br>
First, refer back to my overview that Jesus did not come to bring a religion but
a relationship with God. Relationships are not simple formulas or rules. They
are messy. We cannot easily define all the boundaries. Our lives have fuzzy
edges and things difficult and even impossible to understand. Jesus present
things that do not follow simple rules and are hard to understand. The whole
reason for trinitarian theology is to try to understand something that is very
confusing.<br>
<br>
That said I can show several places where John presents Jesus as God.<br>
<ul>
  <li>
    John 1:18 "No one has ever seen God, but God the One and Only, who is at the
    Father's side, has made him known." Jesus is speaking and calling himself
    God. This verse is also interesting because the first "God" uses an
    anarthrous θεον (god) to refer to the one true God.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born,
    I am!" Here Jesus uses the Greek εγω ειμι. In doing so he quotes the name
    God gives himself in Exodus 3:14. From about 250 BC to 150 BC Jewish
    scholars in Alexandria, Egypt produced a Greek translation of the Old
    Testament. It is called the Septuagint (often abbreviated LXX, "septuagint"
    is Latin meaning "seventy," and it is so named because tradition is that
    seventy scholars worked on it). The Septuagint was in common use in at the
    time of Jesus. The Septuagint uses the exact phrase Jesus uses, εγω ειμι, in
    Exodus 3:14 when God says "I AM." The Jews understood what Jesus meant as we
    see by their reaction in verse 59: "At this, they picked up stones to stone
    him."<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    John 10:28-33 " 'I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no
    one can snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is
    greater than all; no one can snatch them out of my Father's hand. I and the
    Father are one.' Again the Jews picked up stones to stone him, but Jesus
    said to them, 'I have shown you many great miracles from the Father. For
    which of these do you stone me?' 'We are not stoning you for any of these,'
    replied the Jews, 'but for blasphemy, because you, a mere man, claim to be
    God.' " Jesus in this passage refers to himself as one with the Father while
    also referring to the Father as separate from himself. How can this be? I'm
    not sure but clearly Jesus sees himself as God yet different from the
    Father. As I mention under Argument 4, anarthous θεον (god) is used for God
    at the end of the passage.
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    John 20:28-29 "Thomas said to him, 'My Lord and my God!' Then Jesus told
    him, 'Because you have seen me, you have believed; blessed are those who
    have not seen and yet have believed.' " Thomas calls Jesus God. Jesus does
    not correct him but instead states that Thomas believes and blesses those
    who believe like Thomas but without seeing. We can only assume that Jesus
    approves of Thomas and us believing he is God.
  </li>
</ul>
<br>
How do we reconcile John 17:1,3 with Jesus repeatedly making himself equal with
God? I'm not sure. I'm not even sure the trinitarian formula is completely
correct. I am sure Jesus claims to be God. It is very clear. I'm still trying to
understand the details.<br>
<br>
<b>8. Compare the usage of θεος (god) with the usage of ανθρωπος (man).</b><br>
<br>
JPA compares the usage of θεος (god) with ανθρωπος (man) to show how the article
affects the meaning of θεος (god). JPA states that when used with the article
ανθρωπος (man) means a certain, definite "man." Without the article it means "a
man." She cites John 1:6, John 3:4, John 3:27, John 7:23, John 7:46, John&nbsp;
9:16, John 10:33, and John 16:21. I agree that JPA captures the normal
translation of ανθρωπος (man) with and without the article. I'll only bring up
John 10:33 briefly at the end of this section.<br>
<br>
However, JPA make a subtle mistake. She is trying to make a Greek-to-English
translation rule. As I say above, we don't translate by making a bunch of
Greek-to-English rules. What we do is first decide the Greek meaning. Then we
decide how to best express that meaning in English.<br>
<br>
The semantics of "man" in both English and Greek are simpler than the semantics
of "god." This is because the word "god" can refer to the one supreme being
"God" or it can refer to just a bunch of very powerful beings "gods." Saying
"Eric is a man" or "Eric is man" carry much the same meaning. Saying "Eric is a
god" or "Eric is God" carry very different meanings. We cannot simply compare
the forms and patterns of usage of "man" with "god.". It does not work. JPA's
formal comparison of ανθρωπος (man) and θεος (god) is invalid.<br>
<br>
This can be confusing, so let me illustrate the semantics of "man." When I say
"Eric is a man." I can mean several things. I can mean any of the following:<br>
<ol>
  <li>
    "Eric is human (and not an animal)."<br>
  </li>
  <li>
    "Eric is human (and not God)."
  </li>
  <li>
    "Eric is human (he fails like all humans)."<br>
  </li>
  <li>
    "Eric is male (not female)."
  </li>
  <li>
    "Eric is strong, rugged and works all day (a manly man)."
  </li>
</ol>
<br>
I picked all of these because they all have a qualitative meaning. Yet they come
from a statement "Eric is a man" which has the indefinite article! When I say
"Eric is a god" I completely lose the quality of divinity. That is, "Eric is a
god" makes absolutely no statement about "Eric" being the one and only God.
"Eric is a man," on the other hand, directly implies that "Eric is man."<br>
<br>
Finally, even for ανθρωπος (man) the simple translation rule "Greek article
means definite article in English, no Greek article means indefinite article in
English" does not always work. Let's look at usages of ανθρωπος (man) in the
Gospel of John which do not follow this rule.<br>
<ul>
  <li>
    John 2:25&nbsp; αυτος γαρ εγινωσκεν τι ην εν τω ανθρωπω "for he knew what
    was in a man" Notice that here ανθρωπω (man) has the article (τω) yet the
    English translation uses the indefinite article.<br>
  </li>
  <li>
    John 5:34 εγω δε ου παρα ανθρωπου την μαρτυριαν λαμβανω "Not that I accept
    human testimony" By JPA's rules this is a definite construction (ανθρωπου
    [man] is genitive and it has a preposition παρα [from]). Nonetheless it is
    translated qualitatively.<br>
  </li>
  <li>
    John 7:51 μη ο νομος ημων κρινει τον ανθρωπον "Does our law condemn anyone"
    or more literally "Our Law does not judge a man." ανθρωπον (man) has the
    article (τον) yet it is translated indefinitely as "anyone" or "a man"
    because it has a qualitative meaning and that is the correct way to express
    the qualitative meaning in English in this context.<br>
  </li>
  <li>
    John 8:40 νυν δε ζητειτε με αποκτειναι ανθρωπον ος την αληθειαν υμιν
    λελαληκα ην ηκουσα παρα του θεου "As it is, you are determined to kill me, a
    man who has told you the truth that I heard from God." Here the anarthous
    ανθρωπον refers to a specific man (Jesus). The English translation reflects
    the lack of article "a man." Strictly speaking this follows the simple rule,
    but the meaning is far from indefinite.
  </li>
  <li>
    John 10:33 απεκριθησαν αυτω οι ιουδαιοι περι καλου εργου ου λιθαζομεν σε
    αλλα περι βλασφημιας και οτι συ ανθρωπος ων ποιεις σεαυτον θεον "We are not
    stoning you for any of these," replied the Jews, "but for blasphemy, because
    you, a mere man, claim to be God." I couldn't resist this one, especially
    since it is one of JPA's examples. Ανθρωπος (man) is translated "a man" as
    JPA says and it does follow the simple rule. However, notice that θεον (god)
    does not have the article but refers to the one true God! Also notice that
    the Jews realize that Jesus is claiming to be God. What I couldn't resist is
    the irony of JPA missing the obvious evidence for Jesus' godhood just to
    make a grammatical point.<br>

<br>
<b>9. Trinitarians have invented Colwell's Rule and the rule that when the
predicate nominative comes before the verb it is qualitative. If these rules
truly hold instances of it should not be translated "a man."</b><br>
<br>
JPA brings up Colwell's Rule and a rule about qualitative PNs that grammarians
such as Wallace use. These ideas are usually introduced in second year Greek. To
discuss them I need to use references that will probably be hard to understand
for anyone who has not studied Greek or at least linguistics. I'll do my best,
but this section will be hard if you are not familiar with Koine.<br>
<br>
Trinitarians did not invent Colwell's rule just to prove their point. There is
good evidence for it, as Wallace explains (pp. 256-266). However, The rule does
not apply to John 1:1 so I concede that Colwell's Rule should not be used to
prove that θεος (god) in John 1:1c is definite. I'll also acknowledge that many
have wrongly applied Colwell's Rule to John 1:1. Wallace does a good job of
explaining why Colwell's Rule does not apply (Wallace pp. 266-270). It is a
logic problem, not a grammar problem. Wallace (p. 260) quotes a study by Dixon
(Paul Stephen Dixon, "The Significance of of the Anarthrous Predicate Nominative
in John." Th.M. thesis, Dallas Theological Seminary, 1975). Dixon points out
that Colwell's rule is the converse of what is needed for it to apply to John
1:1c.<br>
<br>
JPA also says the "qualitative rule" is made up. JPA does not specify what this
rule is. Wallace (p. 262) gives a good statement of a "qualitative rule" so I'll
refer to it here "An anarthrous pre-verbal PN is normally qualitative, sometimes
definite, and only rarely indefinite." Wallace illustrates the rule on p. 263
with a chart. The chart shows the three possible meanings of a PN: definite,
qualitative and indefinite. "Qualitative" is shown as being between definite and
indefinite with meanings that are at times close to one end or the other and at
time in the middle. Pre-verbal PNs usually fall in the definite-qualitative
range of meanings.<br>
<br>
This rule is not just made up. Wallace has a good discussion of the use of PNs
when he discusses Colwell's Rule. On page 259 Wallace points out that Harner did
a study of anarthrous pre-verbal PN constructions. Harner found that about 80%
of Colwell's constructions involved qualitative nouns and only 20% indefinite
(Philip B. Harner, "Qualitative Anarthrous Predicate Nouns: Mark 15:39 and John
1:1," Journal of Biblical Literature 92 (1973) p. 76. The essay is pp. 75-87).
In other words, Harner did an empirical study to determine usage. JPA can of
course disagree and cite contrary evidence. But it is being dishonest or badly
informed when it claims the rule is made up, since Wallace provides plenty of
evidence.<br>
<br>
From the Greek perspective it makes perfect sense that putting the predicate
before the verb makes it more definite. In English we use word order to
determine grammatical usage. "The boy hit the ball." and "The ball hit the boy."
mean two different things. The difference is due solely to the word order. In
the first sentence "The boy" is the subject because it is first, while "the
ball" is the object. In the second sentence this is reversed: "The ball" is the
subject while "the boy" is the object. Greek does not do this. Greek determines
grammatical function primarily by changing the ends of words. (Grammarians call
these changes case endings.) What word order can be used for in Greek is
emphasis. To a Greek speaker moving the predicate before the verb tends to
emphasize it. This emphasis tends to make it more definite. Thus it's no
surprise that when the PN is before the verb it is almost never indefinite.<br>
<br>
Wallace (pp. 263-264) gives many examples of definite and qualitative anarthrous
pre-verbal PNs. I repeat the ones he explains here as examples.<br>

<b><font size=5>Some Biblical Evidence that Jesus of Nazareth is
God.</font></b><br>
<br>
This paper is primarily an answer to specific arguments given by JPA. Just
showing JPA, or anyone else, wrong does not prove that Jesus is God. I have
presented many positive arguments for the divinity of Christ already in this
paper . Here I want to summarize some of the positive arguments -- both those
I've presented and others. Christians did not just make up the idea of Jesus'
divinity. They drew it from the Bible. I hope this section gives a good feel why
Jesus being God is a necessary belief for those of us who believe the Bible..<br>
<br>
<b> John 1:1 says Jesus is God.</b><br>
<br>
The Koine of John 1:1 is clear. It says the Word (Jesus) is God. There are
several reasons for this:<br>
<ul>
  <li>
    Using the article in front of θεος (god) would be wrong.
  </li>
  <li>
    Putting θεος (god) before the verb emphasizes it and makes it more definite.
    The expected meaning would be qualitative or definite.<br>
  </li>
  <li>
    Predicates before the verb almost never have an indefinite meaning.
  </li>
  <li>
    The phrase "In the beginning was the Word" points to the eternal existence
    of the Word. This is a clear parallel with Genesis 1:1.<br>

    which of these do you stone me?' 'We are not stoning you for any of these,'

    God ever say, 'You are my Son; today I have become your Father'? Or again,
    'I will be his Father, and he will be my Son'? And again, when God brings

    You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness; therefore God, your God,

<b><font size=5>Conclusion</font></b><br>
<br>
JPA raises many technical points that may sound convincing at first glance.
However, JPA is riddled with errors. She incorrectly reduces Greek grammar to a
set of translation rules. She makes unsupported claims both about Greek grammar
and what church fathers say. She uses references to support something contrary
to what the reference is actually saying and even quotes a book that doesn't
exist. She uses Greek grammar references as if she had deep Koine knowledge yet
at other times shows gross ignorance of Greek or even of basic linguistics.<br>
<br>
The Greek construction in John 1:1c is properly translated "The Word was God."
The grammar and context make this clear. Translating the phrase "The Word was a
god" has no support in Koine grammar. Not only does John 1:1 clearly proclaim
Jesus as God, there are many other places in the Bible that do the same.<br>
