<P><P><P><P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Quartz Hill School of Theology is an academic institution designed
to train believers for more effective ministry, both in and out
of the church. QHST affirms that each believer is a priest before
God, indwelt by the Holy Spirit, not needing any human intermediary
to reach God and competent to judge spiritual matters for him
or herself.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In accordance with the firm conviction of the faculty that the
Bible in its entirety is the Word of God, Quartz Hill School of
Theology stresses 1) a thorough knowledge of the Bible and related
areas, 2) the importance of presenting the truth of the Bible
in a meaningful and interesting fashion, and 3) the importance
of spiritual power and vitality.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For this reason, the curriculum centers around the original languages
of the Bible: Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek. All students who earn
a degree will also have learned a reading knowledge of the languages
in which God originally put his Word. In addition, students will
learn Bible exposition and Theology. The emphasis in all these
basic studies is on methodology as well as content and application.
To implement the application, the courses will usually be taught
by people who have themselves had extensive experience in their
areas of specialization, beyond simple academics.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Students will be expected and encouraged to be actively engaged
in some form of Christian outreach and ministry, thus applying
for themselves those things that they are learning.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In all its work, Quartz Hill School of Theology strives to be
academically thorough, yet very practical in its approach to the
Bible. Only after the student has thoroughly learned and digested
the Word of God and applied it to him or herself, can he or she
adequately reach others with its life-giving message.
