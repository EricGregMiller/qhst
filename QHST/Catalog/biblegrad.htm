<h1><B>1. Bible and Theology</B></h1> </center>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Courses in Bible and Theology stress the understanding and interpretation
of biblical literature, both in English and in the original languages.
Graduate level courses (those with numbers 5 and above) may be
taken only by those who have at least two years of Hebrew and
Greek. The Bible program at Quartz Hill School of Theology emphasizes
the original languages and it is expected that our graduates will
have a good reading knowledge of Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek.
