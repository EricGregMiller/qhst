<h1><B>7. Science</B></h1> </center>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The courses in science are designed to give students a better
understanding of the natural or general revelation of God and
to demonstrate that there is no conflict between the Bible and
Science: in fact, the more that is learned about the universe,
the clearer is our understanding of the majesty of God.
