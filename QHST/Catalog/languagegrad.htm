<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Graduation with a degree from Quartz Hill School of Theology will
require students to have a thorough knowledge of Hebrew, Aramaic
and Greek. No one who works seriously with the Bible can afford
to neglect the original languages.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In addition to the biblical languages, students might also wish
to take related ancient languages from the Near East, or modern
languages such as Spanish and Signing Exact English.
