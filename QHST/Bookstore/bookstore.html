<h3><a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/131595" target="_blank"> <img class="Left" src="/QHPH/complaint.jpg" alt="The Complaint of Jacob"/></a>
<span class="Title">The Complaint of Jacob</span> by R.P. Nettelhorst</h3>

<p>Jacob’s life was not a particularly easy one and his family life, both growing up, and then as an adult was certainly what would fit the modern definition of being “dysfunctional.”</p>
<p>So, to say the least, Jacob was not at all happy.  The one true love of his life was dead.  Joseph, his favorite, the oldest son of his beloved, had been dead for twenty-five years.  And now Simeon had been taken from him, and this monster in Egypt was demanding the last link he had to his dead lover.  Beside himself with grief, we find his reaction in Genesis 42:36 where it all comes down to this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Their father Jacob said to them, "You have deprived me of my children. Joseph is no more and Simeon is no more, and now you want to take Benjamin. Everything is against me!"</p> 
</blockquote>
<p>And certainly it was the case that the circumstances of his life, from his perspective, from the perspective of his sons standing around him, made his complaint fully reasonable and perfectly understandable.
And yet, the fascinating thing about his words, for those of us reading the story, is that we know that he couldn’t be more wrong, despite the fact that his words seemed so obviously true to Jacob – unassailably true, in fact.  But we the readers of this little episode, know something that Jacob doesn’t: we know that Joseph is not only not dead, but he is second in command in Egypt, the most powerful and most wealthy nation on the planet at that time.  We also know that there’s no way for poor Jacob to know that.</p>
<p>So the reality of Jacob’s existence is that everything could hardly be better.  His favorite son has done very well for himself, thank you.  Good job, and great future, with money to burn.   Poor Jacob simply doesn’t know this yet.  His perception, his perspective of reality, is incorrect.</p>
<p>And we, the readers, can do nothing to alleviate Jacob’s suffering just now. And God didn’t do anything about it either.  It’ll be another year before Jacob learns the truth of what his life is really like.  For twenty-five years he mourned for someone who was not dead at all.  He bemoans his fate as a miserable one, though his family is absolutely powerful and prosperous.  But he doesn’t know any of that; in fact, he has no way of knowing any of that.</p>
<p>September 11, 2001 was thus an exceptionally bad day (to say the least) and raised numerous questions in the minds of many people about the nature of existence, about the goodness of God, about what it is really, that God wants and expects out of all of us.  How do we live in a world where this sort of thing can happen?  How do we face the crises of life, both small and great?  Is there some key to life, some playbook we can get, some list we can follow, some formula we can memorize that will get us through life in one piece, with ourselves and our families living productive and prosperous lives?  What does Jacob's complaint tell us about our relationship to God and the world?</p>

<span class="Title">Baptist Confessions of Faith: For the Person in the Pew</span></b> by Jim West</h3>
<p>Baptists are not a creedal people. That is, they do not require their Church members to subscribe to a particular Creed or statement of belief. But Baptists do believe and so they do make confession of those beliefs. Here are the most important of those historical confessions in chronological order: a summary of beliefs held by Baptists since their beginning.

<h3><a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/112460" target="_blank"> <img class="Left" src="/QHPH/jimbiblestudy.jpg" alt="BIBLICAL STUDIES" /></a>
<span class="Title">Biblical Studies: A Beginner's Guide</span> by Jim West</h3>
<p>It is a handy one volume introduction to the basic tools and issues of Biblical Studies.  It includes a brief history of Israel and the Church (in its earliest years); the Biblical languages Hebrew and Greek; the theology of the Old and New Testaments; a proposed solution to the Synoptic relationships; a brief look at the use of the Old Testament by the writers of the New, and a short introduction to the Dead Sea Scrolls.  
	It may appear to some that this is a bit much to handle in one book; but the author's purpose is not to discuss every viewpoint or look under every rock.  Rather, he wishs simply to place in the interested person’s hand a handy tool with which to begin Biblical Studies.  In our day of over-specialization what is needed among the inhabitants of the pew is a general overview.  That, and that alone, is what the author is seeking to provide.
	To those who will find fault in his failure to treat their pet issues, he can only beg indulgence and reassure them that his goal is quite simple.
	<span class="Title">Biblical Studies</span> is a workbook.  Assignments are made, and if the interested reader is diligent he or she has in hand an excellent resource for self-learning.  If the exercises that are recommended are accomplished, there is no doubt that the reader will be a much better informed believer than he or she was previously.  Each chapter is self-contained, so that the student may study those items of greatest interest first, and then proceed to the other chapters.  
</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/278234" target="_blank"> <img class="Right" src="/QHPH/jimtheology.jpg" alt="SYSTEMATIC THEOLOGY" /></a>
<span class="Title">Systematic Theology: Theology for the Person in the Pew</span> by Jim West</h3>
<p>It is designed to put into the hands of the lay person a resource for basic systematic theology.  It is hoped that those readers who have an interest in theology will find it useful.  It is not a complicated, or complex text.  Indeed, it is intentionally brief, to the point, and filled with classical statements about doctrinal subjects.  But it is also filled with scriptural references because the author firmly believes that any theology worth the name is scripturally based.</p>
<p>Professional theologians, those with seminary degrees or advanced degrees in theology will find in the following pages absolutely nothing new, with the possible exception of the author's disinterest in eschatological matters.  But remember, this book isn’t written for theologians—it is written for the non-specialist.
	It is the people who sit in a pew week after week who will find this a useful book: the people who make up the Church.</p>

<span class="Title">Matthew: For the Person in the Pew</span> by Jim West</h4>
<p>This commentary on Matthew is part of a series, each to be published by Quartz Hill Publishing House, and each to be in a concise format.</p>
<p>So far as technical matters are concerned, or how the commentary works, it is quite straightforward: the text of Matthew is in bold print and comments follow each verse or passage in normal font.  At the conclusion of the commentary there is a bibliography so that those interested can read further.  The textual base of the commentary is the venerable American Standard Version of 1901.  There are no frills here: no extensive footnotes, no lengthy outlines, no overbearing introductions—just the text and what it means.</p>
<p>For many years commentaries have been written for commentators.  The great volumes which line pastors’ and professors’ bookshelves were written by experts for experts.  Meanwhile, the person in the pew, the person for whom the Bible was written, transmitted, and preserved, has essentially been forgotten.  This commentary, and this series, are designed to correct that situation.  Making use of the best and latest tools of biblical research, the results of that research will appear here in such a way as to be useful for personal devotion and preaching, Sunday School lessons, and “growing in grace.”</p>

<p>This commentary on James and 1-2 Peter is part of a series, each to be published by Quartz Hill Publishing House, and each to be in a concise format.</p>
<p>So far as technical matters are concerned, or how the commentary works, it is quite straightforward: the text of the epistles is in bold print and comments follow each verse or passage in normal font.  At the conclusion of the commentary there is a bibliography so that those interested can read further.  The textual base of the commentary is the venerable American Standard Version of 1901.  There are no frills here: no extensive footnotes, no lengthy outlines, no overbearing introductions—just the text and what it means.</p>
<p>For many years commentaries have been written for commentators.  The great volumes which line pastors’ and professors’ bookshelves were written by experts for experts.  Meanwhile, the person in the pew, the person for whom the Bible was written, transmitted, and preserved, has essentially been forgotten.  This commentary, and this series, are designed to correct that situation.  Making use of the best and latest tools of biblical research, the results of that research will appear here in such a way as to be useful for personal devotion and preaching, Sunday School lessons, and “growing in grace.”</p>

<span class="Title">John of the Apocalypse</span> by R.P. Nettelhorst</h3>  
<p>If everything in your life went wrong, wouldn’t it be nice if Jesus came and told you why? “Why doesn’t God do something?” It was a question heavy on John’s mind. He had seen all his companions bleed and die; thousands of his compatriots had been slaughtered by a brutal tyranny. It seemed such an odd way for God to treat his most faithful servants. John was just a lonely old man exiled for his beliefs on the island of Patmos. And then Jesus unexpectedly showed up with good news and an explanation.</p>

<h3><span class="Title">The Arabian Nights</span> translated by Richard Burton, in 16 volumes.</h3>
<p>The nineteenth century reader of Burton’s Arabian Nights was scandalized and shocked by the explicit, by their terms, sexuality. In contrast, the modern reader will largely be unbothered by the sexual references in the book and in fact will find them tame, even compared to the standards of network television. Instead, he or she will be scandalized and shocked by the rampant racism and misogyny apparent in description, situations and terminology. All that one can suggest is that readers try to remember the time when the book was translated: the late 1800s. We’ve chosen to present Burton’s translation as is, rather than to update the language for modern sensibilities. The only alteration from the original version is in format and paragraphing.</p>
<p>The Arabian Nights, is a piece of medieval Middle-Eastern literature in the style of a frame tale. The story starts with the Persian Shahryar, king of an unnamed island “between India and China” (in modern editions based on Arab transcripts he is king of India and China), who is so shocked by his wife's infidelity that he kills her and, believing all women to be likewise unfaithful, gives his vizier an order to get him a new wife every night (in some versions, every third night). After spending one night with his bride, the king has her executed at dawn. This practice continues for some time, until the vizier's clever daughter Shahrazad (the name is perhaps better-known in English as “Scheherazade” or “Shahrastini,” which is a Persian name) forms a plan and volunteers to become Shahrayar's next wife. Every night after their marriage, she spends hours telling him stories, each time stopping at dawn with a cliff-hanger, so the king will postpone the execution out of a desire to hear the rest of the tale. In the end, she has given birth to three sons, and the king has been convinced of her faithfulness and revoked his decree.
The tales vary widely; they include historical tales, love stories, tragedies, comedies, poems, burlesques and Muslim religious legends.</p>
