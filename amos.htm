<B>The Book of Amos</B> 
<P>
<B>I. Title</B> 
<P>
The title is the same in Hebrew as it is in the English and Greek
translations. The name Amos means &quot;burden&quot; or &quot;burdensome&quot;
<P>
<B>II. Author and Setting</B> 
<P>
Amos is not mentioned outside of this book. He was from Tekoa,
a village about six miles south of Bethlehem, in Judah. Amos was
placed after Joel in the canon because it seemed to be an expansion
of Joel 3:16: &quot;Yahweh will roar from Zion.&quot; In the same
way, Obadiah seemed to be an expansion of Amos 9:12: &quot;that
they may possess the remnant of Edom.&quot; Amos prophesied to
the Northern Kingdom of Israel.
<P>
The book is dated between 767 and 753 BC. Political, both the
Northern Kingdom under Jeroboam II and the Southern Kingdom, under
Uzziah, were at the height of their prosperity. They had most
of the nations around them subjugated, and they were free of the
fear of external powers. Neither kingdom had any obvious reason
to anticipate God's coming judgment, although both kings were
suffering a time of moral corruption, luxury, and vice. The corruption
existed not only in politics, but also in religion: the prophets
and priests were serving God only for profit.
<P>
Prophets contemporary with Amos were Hosea and Jonah.
