III. Basic Presuppositions<P>
	A. Introduction<P>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Besides keeping a lot of theologians off welfare and out of trouble, theology's primary value is clarification.  Unlike the way teachers so often present it, theology is not a settled issue of firmly established facts. Theology is theory, and like theory in science, forever alive and developing. In the early Church questions arose now and then and theology -- theory -- to answer them had to be developed.  For instance, in Acts, the church was faced with the problem of what to do with all the Gentiles who were coming to Christ.  Did they have to become Jews first, before they could be saved?  Or was entrance into Christianity by grace alone?  And then, even if it was by grace, shouldn't they follow the laws of Judaism?  <br>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Later on, people began wondering who, precisely, was Jesus? Was he really God, or simply an emanation, or maybe a created being?<br>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;How are such questions answered?  By studying the Bible -- God's special revelation -- and the universe -- God's general revelation -- and finding out what they say.  This action, of looking to the Bible and the world for answers, raises a question of its own: if we are going to find out about God, if we are going to do a proper theology -- formulate reasonable theories -- what are the revelations of God, and how do we go about using them properly?<P>
	B. How do we Find Out About God?
<P>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In modern thinking, a certain dualism has arisen, whereby reason
and science have been separated from the realm of faith and religion,
severed like East and West Berlin once were.  Francis Bacon wrote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It is therefore most wise soberly to render unto faith the things
that are faith's, [for from the] absurd mixture of matters divine
and human [proceed heresies and] fantastical philosophies.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the same vein, a guest lecturer I once heard at UCLA stressed
that it is a fundamental methodological error to mix the &quot;religious&quot;
experience and the &quot;scientific&quot; experience.  As he would
say, one cannot ask of religious evidence the same things one
would ask of scientific evidence.
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Such thinking has infected the minds of many Christians, but
it's time to take a pill.  This iron curtain must collapse, this
Berlin wall in our philosophy must fall. While it is one thing
to read modern scientific theory into ancient poetry (or to read
anything into it, for that matter), it is another to exclude spacetime
affirmations from the book authored by the Creator of the physical
universe.  A certain question needs asking: is God real, or isn't
he?  Is he as real as this chair, this piece of chalk, the food
I ate for lunch?
<br>
   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unfortunately for many Christians today, the answer is negative.
 For them the Bible is infallible only in &quot;spiritual&quot;
matters, and does not speak inerrantly of historical and scientific
things; they actually imagine it makes no cognitive truth claims
about God, or about the physical universe.
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To illustrate how this modern dualistic disease, this iron curtain,
works out in a practical way, an example can be taken from Mormonism.
 John Dart in the <I>Los Angeles Times </I>wrote: 
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Some Mormons have asked rhetorically how much  difference exists
- in the final analysis - between a salamander and an angel and
between magic and religion.
<br>
   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Others have said the basic truths of the faith are unaffected.
 The Arizona-based <I>Latter-Day Sentinel</I>, which is also circulated
in Southern California, recently ran a story with the headline,
&quot;So Why the Fuss Over the 'White Salamander' Letter?&quot;
It noted efforts to equate a white salamander with an angelic
figure or an ancient warrior, which Moroni was, according to the
Book of Mormon.
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Susan Turley, an editor at the newspaper, said, &quot;Like most
Mormons I know in the Phoenix area, my testimony of the church
is not based on history but (on) what my own spiritual experience
and study of church doctrine have done for me.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The words of that newspaper editor summarize the modern philosophic
view of religion generally: it is simply &quot;truth for me&quot;.
 Religion has become utterly subjective and completely personal;
it is not based on objective fact, like the existence of say,
a bar of soap.
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Contrast the modern attitude toward spiritual truth with the
words of Peter in Acts 2:22-37:
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Men of Israel, listen to this: Jesus of Nazareth was a
man accredited by God to you by miracles, wonders and signs, which
God did among you through him, as you yourselves know.  This man
was handed over to you by God's set purpose and foreknowledge;
and you, with the help of wicked men, put him to death by nailing
him to the cross.  But God raised him from the dead, freeing him
from the agony of death, because it was impossible for death to
keep its hold on him.  David said about him:
<P><blockquote>
  'I saw the Lord always before me.  
<BR>
 Because he is at my right hand, I will not be shaken.  
<BR>
 Therefore my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices;
<BR>  my body also will live in hope, 
<BR>
 because you will not abandon me to the grave,
<BR>
  nor will you let your Holy One see decay.  
<BR>
 You have made known to me the paths of life;
<BR>
 you will fill me with joy in your presence.'</blockquote>
<P>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brothers, I can tell you confidently that the patriarch David
died and was buried, and his tomb is here to this day.  But he
was a prophet and knew that God had promised him on oath that
he would place one of his descendants on his throne.  Seeing what
was ahead, he spoke of the resurrection of the Christ, that he
was not abandoned to the grave, nor did his body see decay.  God
has raised this Jesus to life, and we are all witnesses of the
fact.  Exalted to the right hand of God, he has received from
the Father the promised Holy Spirit and has poured out what you
now see and hear.  For David did not ascend to heaven, and yet
he said 'The Lord said to my Lord: &quot;Sit at my right hand
until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.&quot;'  Therefore
let all Israel be assured of this: God has made this Jesus, whom
you crucified, both Lord and Christ.&quot;
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When the people heard this, they were cut to the heart and said
to Peter and the other apostles, &quot;Brothers, what shall we
do?&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Notice that Peter's sermon is critically dependent on the reality
of certain events.  He makes several statements rooted in objective,
or verifiable reality.  He says that Jesus was a man that his
hearers had known, who had performed certain deeds that they had
witnessed and heard about, that he had been killed by them, and
that he had risen bodily from the dead.  Peter also discusses
a former king of Israel, historically verifiable, named David
and quotes from writings which purport to have come from his hand.
 If the events that Peter is describing did not occur as described,
then Peter's message is untrue.  He bases his conclusion about
who Jesus is theologically on what occurred historically.
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The same is true for Christianity as a whole.  Critics have not
been shy about pointing this out.  Michael Arnheim writes:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;More than any other religion, Christianity stands four-square
on the acceptance of an historical improbability: namely, that
one particular man was no mere mortal but &quot;the Christ,&quot;
whose death changed the course of human history forever and who
continues to exist as &quot;God the Son,&quot; part of an indivisible
threefold Godhead....
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was only in the wake of the rationalism and skepticism of
the Enlightenment that the historical accuracy of the Christian
scriptures eventually came to be questioned.  With the application
to the Gospel of the methods of historical criticism applied to
secular sources, the Gospel accounts were declared by scholar
after scholar to be unreliable.  By the early twentieth century
the so-called &quot;Quest for the historical Jesus&quot; was bogged
down in negativism.  The Gospels, according to an influential
school of Protestant theologians, were to be taken as theological
rather than as historical documents, and they could yield no authentic
information about the life and deeds, or even the sayings and
teachings of Jesus.
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Such a conclusion might have been expected to have a cataclysmic
effect upon Christianity.  For, after all, there could surely
be no Christianity without Christ, and could there be a Christ
without Jesus?  But if Jesus were so shadowy a figure as to belong
more to the realm of myth and legend than to that of history and
fact, the whole edifice of Christianity must surely crumble.
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Not so, said the radical theologians.  The truth of Christianity
was independent of historical proof, and historical evidence was
therefore quite irrelevant to the validity of Christianity.
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;How then <I>is</I> one to decide on the truth or falsehood of
Christianity?  For Rudolf Bultmann, one of the most influential
Christian theologians of the twentieth century, the key element
was what he called an &quot;existential encounter with Christ,&quot;
which did not depend upon any intellectual critical process but
rather on a leap into the dark - or, to put it more crudely, upon
an acceptance of faith on trust.
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;J. Knox and D.E. Nineham, two leading British theologians, similarly
reject the possibility of basing Christian  faith upon historical
evidence but resort instead to the church as the basis of faith,
thus becoming caught in a circular argument.  As Donald Guthrie
remarks: &quot;Neither Nineham nor Knox has recognized the inconsistency
of appealing to the testimony of the Church when they have already
denied the historical accounts, which they regard as the products
of the Church.&quot;
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With this we are back to square one: By what criterion may the
truth or falsehood of Christianity be judged?  To base one's acceptance
of a religion upon blind faith or unsupported trust gives one
no right to claim the superiority of that religion over any other
religion, nor does it entitle one to assert the truth of that
religion.  And yet no religion in the world is more insistent
than Christianity upon its claim to truth or more confident of
its superiority to all other faiths.
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;More than any other religion Christianity revolves around a single
historical figure, and in the absence of any viable alternative
method of testing the validity of Christianity we have no option
but to begin at the beginning, focus unblinkingly on Jesus and
test the truth of the Christian claims made for him.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If the Bible is not historically and scientifically accurate,
then we have nothing to believe, because Christianity, more than
any other faith, is a historical faith.  Without the objective
reality of what is reported in the Bible, the reader might as
well close this book and throw it away, because in Christianity
we have nothing.
<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It is very important, therefore, that in our proclamation of
the good news, it be proclaimed as the good news Christ died for
sinners, was raised from the dead, and now is Lord.  The good
news is <I>not</I> just &quot;Look at what God has done for me.
 I was a drug addicted male prostitute and beat up old ladies
just to get my jollies.  But now I'm a changed person.&quot; 
All religions can make similar claims, along with most new toothpastes:
&quot;try new Zippo toothpolish and you'll be a sex object and
have to beat off members of the opposite sex with baseball bats.&quot;
 The gospel must not be reduced to the level of toothpaste.
<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It must be borne in mind at all times that if God had not revealed
himself to the human race, or if individuals ignore God's revelation
of himself, then almost no knowledge of God is possible.  There
can be no fellowship with Him unless He chooses to introduce Himself
to you.
<p>
 <B>If There is a God, How Can We Know Anything About Him?</B>
<P>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If we accept the idea that there is a God, how do we learn anything
about Him?  Or them?  What can we figure out about who he, she,
or they are?  Is there one Supreme Being, or many powerful beings,
none of whom is entirely all powerful?  And if many, how many?
 Two, three - 160 million, as one would find in the Hindu pantheon?
 If the concept of divinity is accepted, then the poor human searcher
is left in something of a quandary. Which of the thousands of
religions (or cults, as some are pejoratively labeled) correct?
 Or are any?  Has anyone come up with the right answer?  For that
matter, is it really necessary to know anything about God, if
he, she or they are so distantly mysterious and insubstantial?
 What do he, she, or they want of us?  If it/them wants something,
why doesn't it/them tell us? Why does He have to make it so difficult?
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Reasonable questions, all, which most Christians are not ready
or willing to answer; questions that in many cases are beyond
their comprehension.
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So what's the poor seeker supposed to do?  He has entered the
house of theism and discovers it's a labyrinthian conundrum of
confusing and contradictory rooms and passageways, every one of
which claims to be, if not the one true way, then at least a true
way. Can it be that every one is correct?
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Some, finding themselves in this mess, become eclectic, like
the man in the pharmacy who says &quot;give me one of everything,
just in case.&quot;  Can there be certainty?
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Certainly!  Perhaps the main problem at this juncture is that
many a seeker after the right road has left his brain behind.
 Despite our earlier discussion, the main philosophical mold in
which most of us have grown up has made us believe that religious
truth and scientific truth are necessarily separate and unequal
realms.  The principles used in deciphering the physical universe
certainly can't be used in trying to understand God, can they?
<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Why not?  Is God real or isn't he?  If he/they exist, then he/they
can be known; principles of logic, reason, and the sifting of
evidence can certainly be made use of in attempting to find the
truth of who God is.
<P>
<B>A Major Fallacy to Avoid:  I think that God is...</B>
<P>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Perhaps it would be good to shoot something down right now. Surely
most of us have heard (if we won't admit having done it ourselves)
someone say something like the following: &quot;Well, I think
God wouldn't like that.&quot;  Or, &quot;When I think of God,
I think of a great glowing light.&quot;
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What is the problem with such statements?  If they were statements
of hypothesis being set up for testing, nothing at all.  But in
almost all such cases, the individual involved is speaking for
God, or about God, out of his or her imagination, with no thought
of checking to see if his or her pronouncements might be accurate.
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To show the idiocy of the situation of imagining something about
God, consider R.P. Nettelhorst.  Who is R.P. Nettelhorst? Man
or Woman?  Maybe a woman.  How old?  Maybe 98.  I imagine her
to be six four and a starring linebacker for the Rams.  Does she
like children?  Sure: she eats them for breakfast with milk and
sugar on them.  Politics?   Democrat or Republican?  I think she's
a Communist!
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ridiculous?  Certainly - but on the same level as the individual
who believes he or she can know God by sitting in a chair without
having had any contact with him/her/them.  You can't know R.P.
Nettelhorst until you meet him.  
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The one who says &quot;I think God is like a man in a long beard,&quot;
is making a statement equal in intellectual rigor and reasonableness
to the one who says, &quot;I believe God is a boiled potato I
keep under my bed&quot; or &quot;I believe R.P. Nettelhorst is
a Commie child-eater.&quot;
<P>
<B>3. How Should I Study About God?</B>
<P>
   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When we think about studying God, the first place we usually
look is the Bible.  What are some things we need to understand
about this book that we all own?  We think we know all about the
Bible, don't we? It has been a part of western civilization for
nearly two thousand years, and most of us have been exposed to
it all our lives.  We therefore assume we understand it.  
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But do we?
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What Thorkild Jacobsen had to say about Sumerian religion should
give us pause as we consider the Bible:
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Considering first the absolute distance in time from the end
of ancient Mesopotamian civilization shortly before the beginning
of our era to the present, it may be noted that it is not only
a distance but a clean break.  No living cultural tradition connects
us with our subject, spans the gap between the ancients and us.
 We are  almost  entirely dependent on such archaeological and
inscrip-tional data as have been recovered and upon our own contemporary
attempts at interpreting them.  These data are, unfortunately,
incomplete and somewhat haphazard as sources for the total culture
to which they testify; and the languages of the inscriptional
materials are still far from being fully understood.  The concepts
denoted by their words and the interrelations of these concepts,
moreover, are not infrequently incongruent with, or accented differently
from, anything in our present day culture and outlook, so that
misunderstanding and even failure to comprehend altogether are
constant stumbling blocks.  
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Formidable as our difficulties are, they are no cause for dismay
or for ceasing our efforts to understand.  If they were, then
earlier generations should have been the ones to give up, for
they had far greater difficulties and far less help than we have.
 Actually, the very realization that difficulties exist often
goes a long way toward overcoming them by forcing upon us the
necessity of other ways of thinking and evaluating than those
to which we are accustomed. We may become alert to the dangers
of too easy generalization, may doubt accepted translations and
search for more adequate meanings of a word.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;While the Bible is certainly familiar, it is also alien.  It
was written thousands of years ago by people living thousands
of miles away from us, speaking a language unknown to most of
us, and still imperfectly understood by those who have devoted
themselves to its study.  The culture of the Bible is radically
different from twentieth century America.  A person diving into
the Bible experiences many of the same problems facing an American
who travels to another country.  Alvin Toffler writes:
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Culture shock is the effect that immersion in a strange culture
has on the unprepared visitor. Peace Corps volunteers suffer from
it in Borneo or Brazil.  Marco Polo probably suffered from it
in Cathay.  Culture shock is what happens when a traveler suddenly
finds himself in a place where yes may mean no, where a &quot;fixed
price&quot; is negotiable, where to be kept waiting in an outer
office is no cause for insult, where laughter may signify anger.
It is what happens when the familiar psychological cues that help
an individual to function in society are suddenly withdrawn and
replaced by new ones that are strange or incomprehensible.
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The culture shock phenomenon accounts for much of the bewilderment,
frustration, and disorientation that plagues Americans in their
dealings with other societies.  It causes a breakdown in communication,
a misreading of reality, an inability to cope.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So it is with the Bible.  It is an alien land, and many people
hop into it unprepared, expecting it to be populated with Americans.
 They read American cultural values, composition techniques, and
democratic ideals into the ancient text.  Those things that they
find in the Bible which don't fit twentieth century norms are
either ignored, misinterpreted, or explained away.
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The people of the Bible, its authors and original readers, did
not think the same way as twentieth century Americans.  The Old
Testament was not written by someone who lived his life in a suburb
of Columbus, Ohio.  To take a modern example of the difficulties
we might face in understanding the Bible, think about the Australians.
 The Australians speak English, they live in a modern industrialized
society, watch TV and do many of the same things Americans do.
 &quot;Walzing Matilda&quot; is a song known to just about every
Australian, and Americans have heard the tune and may know a few
of the words:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I> Once a jolly swag man camped by a billy-bong,</I>
<BR>
<I> Under the shade of a kulibar tree,</I>
<BR>
<I> And he sang as he sat and waited for his billy-boil,</I>
<BR>
<I> &quot;You'll come a-walzing, Matilda, with me.&quot;</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If Americans have difficulty understanding a simple song written
in their own language by people almost like themselves, is it
any wonder that we moderns should have difficulty fully understanding
the Bible?  &quot;Walzing Matilda&quot; has nothing to do with
dancing or girls; instead, it refers to walking with a kind of
knapsack.  A &quot;swag man&quot; is a hobo, and &quot;billy-bong&quot;
is a brook or pond.  A &quot;kulibar&quot; tree is a eucalyptus
tree, and &quot;billy-boil&quot; is coffee.
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Should we give way to despair then as we think about studying
the Bible?  Is it a book that only specialists with years of study
can read?  Not at all.  But certain things do need to be kept
in mind as we begin reading it:
<P><blockquote>
 1. We must not assume that idioms or idiomatic ideas in the Bible
mean the same thing that they do in modern English.  In other
words, don't make assumptions!  Study things carefully.  We must
be careful to notice how a word or phrase is actually being used
in context, before we assume that we understand what it signifies.
 We must be constantly alert to unexpected meanings connected
to what we thought we already understood.  For instance, in English,
the word &quot;heart&quot;, when it doesn't refer to the physical
organ, has the sense of the seat of the emotions.  But in Hebrew
and Near Eastern society in general, it instead had the idea of
&quot;mind&quot;, or the seat of the intellect.  A big difference!
<br>
 2. Be careful to notice how the Biblical documents are structured;
notice that they don't follow the pattern we would expect of a
document written in English.  For instance, in the Old Testament,
and even some in the New Testament, when the Jews wrote poetry
they did not rhyme the sounds; instead they rhymed the ideas.
 In English, adjectives might be piled up one on the other, or
a carefully worded description of characteristics or appearance
might be given, but in Hebrew synonymous phrases are piled one
on top of another.  For example, Psalm 1:1:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> Blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked
<BR>
 or stand in the way of sinners
<BR>
 or sit in the seat of mockers...</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The author of Psalm 1 is not describing three different activities
or types of people.  A native English speaker would have expressed
the verse differently:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I> Blessed is the man who does not practice wickedness as a habit
of life.</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of course this bare prose statement is not as vivid or pretty
as the poetry of the Psalm, but this is the <I>meaning</I> of
Psalm 1:1.
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Therefore, be open to new and different methods of expression.
 Be careful not to prejudge a statement.  Try to understand it
in its complete cultural context, as well as its textual context.
 Check out how words and phrases are used in the Bible - not necessarily
how we use them in modern America.
<br>
 3. We must approach the Bible as an exciting adventure in a foreign
country, where all is not as we may assume it to be.  Most importantly,
we must realize this is where God reveals himself to us; to understand
Him, we must understand the place he reveals himself.</blockquote>
<P>
<B>B. What are Some Basic Guiding Principles for Bible Study?</B>
<P>
 Certain presuppositions - hypotheses that are accepted at the
start of an argument as self-evident (like axioms in geometry)
- should be stated at the outset.  They can be listed as a series
of nine points.  The first three are basic presuppositions which
underlie modern science, and these same basic presuppositions
should also underlie anyone's approach to theology.
<P>
<I><B>1. There is an actually existing external universe.</B></I>
<P>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The universe, and everything it it, is real.  That is should
be necessary to state explicitly something so obvious should not
be viewed as strange.
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Certain eastern philosophies and religions would deny the validity
of just this point, leading inevidtably to solipsism.  Thus, I
would assume that the Bible - God's special revelation  - is real
in the same way that I assume the universe - God's general revelation
- is real.
<P>
<I><B>2. The external universe is attainable accurately by our
senses. </B></I>
<P>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It is possible to gain an accurate understanding of the world
and everything in it by looking, hearing, feeling, and tasting.
 In the same way, I would assume that we may gain an accurate
account of the Bible - God's special revelation. 
<P>
 <I><B>3. The external universe is orderly, endowed with cause
and effect and it follows the laws of logic. </B></I>
<P>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Likewise, the Bible - the special revelation of God - is orderly
and endowed with cause and effect and follows the laws of logic.
 That is, we can gain a correct understanding of the Bible because
the Bible will be consistent, orderly, and sensible.  A consistent
hermeneutic (interpretation or explanation) is possible in examining
the universe, and so a consistent hermeneutic is possible in examining
the Bible.
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Irving M. Copi of the University of Hawaii and author of <I>Introduction
to Logic, </I>argues that there are three fundamental laws of
thought necessary and sufficient for thinking to be &quot;correct&quot;.
 Traditionally, these are called:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> a.The Principle of Identity
<BR>
 b.The Principle of Noncontradiction
<BR>
 c.The Principle of the Excluded Middle</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<I>a. The Principle of Identity</I>
<P>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Simply stated, the first of the fundamental laws is a tautology.
 If any statement is true, then it is true.  Some have criticized
this first principle on the basis that things change. For instance,
in 1790 one could make the statement: &quot;The United States
of America is made up of thirteen States.&quot;  But obviously
such a statement is not true today.  However, the fact of change
in human affairs does not negate this principle of logic. Statements
which change over time are said to be elliptical, or incomplete
statements.  Thus, the statement &quot;The United States of America
is made up of thirteen States&quot; is a partial formulation of
the statement, &quot;The United States of America was made up
of thirteen states in 1790.&quot;  Such a statement is as true
today as it was in 1790. Thus, as Copi said, &quot;When we confine
our attention to complete or non-elliptical formulations, the
Principle of Identity is perfectly true and unobjectionable.&quot;
<P>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<I>b. The Principle of Noncontradiction</I>
<P>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Simply proposed, this asserts that &quot;No statement can be
both true and false.&quot;  Or to take it a step further, &quot;A
given thing cannot be and not be in the same way and to the same
extent at the same time.&quot;  This is a vital principle, without
which reasoned thinking is not possible.  While it may seem obvious
that a given object cannot be both an apple and a peach, this
principle is often ignored or twisted out of shape by both secularists
and theologians.
<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The word &quot;paradox&quot; is used sometimes to describe contradictions
- contradictions that, some would say, must be accepted.  
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For instance, famous experiments with light indicate that under
certain experimental conditions, light acts as if it is made of
particles, while under other experimental conditions, light seems
to be made of waves.  A contradiction!  In some circles it has
been suggested that light is both and neither and we must live
with the contradiction.  
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Occam  would shout &quot;Poppycock!&quot; to that conclusion.
 He was a famous fourteenth century schoolman and philosopher,
born at Ockham in Surrey, England.  A Franciscan, his fundamental
principle was that &quot;entities must not be unnecessarily multiplied.&quot;
 That is, in arriving at a theory for any situation, the simplest
explanation that adequately handles all the data, is more likely
to be correct than a competing explanation which is more complicated.
 One might call this the K.I.S.S. principle: keep it simple, stupid.
 It more commonly is known as Occam's razor.
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Therefore, in the question of the nature of light, the simpler
explanation, by making use of Occam's razor, is to say that the
experiments have settled nothing, and that further study is needed.
 We can't just throw up our hands and say, &quot;Oh well, it's
both; let's say light is made of 'wavicles'.&quot;  What the heck
is a 'wavicle'? The same thing arises in theology in attempts
to explain the Trinity, the relationship of free will to divine
sovereignty, or how a good, all powerful God could permit sin.
 Too often, theologians are satisfied with the paradox - &quot;the
apparent contradiction&quot; - and leave it at that.  Again, Occam's
razor would simply slice through the gobbledygook and tell the
theologians that they have more work to do.  Frank Wilczek and
Betsy Devine, writing about nature (the general revelation of
God), made a very perceptive point, which has definite implications
for understanding the Bible (the special revelation of God):
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nature poses many riddles but contains no contradictions. By
solving one of her puzzles, therefore, we are guaranteed to learn
something - and the weirder, the more impossible the paradox seems
at first, the more mind-expanding will be its ultimate resolution.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What all this means then, is that contradictions cannot be real.
 Such a conclusion is a very hopeful and useful tool, and has
been of immense impetus to scientific research, because this principle
of noncontradiction assures the researcher, in whatever field,
that there is, indeed, an answer to any conundrum.  And if there
is an answer, then it is possible to find it.
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On a personal level, this principle of noncontradiction has some
serious implications.  Every day, we discover people who, within
their lives, are not living up to the principle.  George Orwell
described the problem as &quot;doublethink&quot;.  An older word
for this sort of person is simply &quot;hypocrite&quot;.  The
Bible calls such a person a &quot;double-minded man&quot;:
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If any of you lacks wisdom, he should ask God, who gives generously
to all without finding fault, and it will be given to him.  But
when he asks, he must believe and not doubt, because he who doubts
is like a wave of the sea, blown and tossed by the wind.  That
man should not think he will receive anything from the Lord; he
is a double-minded man, unstable in all he does. (James 1:5-8)
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Come near to God and he will come near to you.  Wash your hands,
you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded. (James
4:8)</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Notice the sheer idiocy and irrationality of the hypocrisy: a
person goes to God to request something that He has promised to
give, but then doesn't believe God will give it.  Such an attitude
irrationally contradicts the truthfulness and goodness of God,
not to mention explicit biblical statements that God does not
lie.  
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The second passage in James 4:8 goes even further, equating hypocrisy
with sin, or better yet, portrays the sinner as being a hypocrite
by definition.  After all, a Christian claims to be filled with
the Holy Spirit, cleansed by the sacrifice of Christ, a new creature,
and yet he sins.  Contradiction. Of all things a nonbeliever delights
in most, it is to point out the inconsistency of believers.  I
give two examples:  
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Catholic theology teaches that the Pope and Church are infallible.
 The doctrines and traditions handed down from the fathers are
as much the words of God as the Bible.  Yet, thousands who claim
to be Catholic, feel perfectly justified ignoring the Catholic
Church's teaching on birth control, abortion, or women in the
Church.  How can this be?
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Doublethink; hypocrisy; inconsistency.  To be a consistent Catholic,
to obey the concept of noncontradiction, the follower of Rome
must accept what the Catholic Church says in all things.  
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Otherwise, that one becomes by definition, no longer Catholic
- but Protestant.  
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By contrast, Baptists claim (in the Protestant tradition) that
the Bible alone is authoritative, that the individual Christian
is free to interpret the Bible for himself, and that all believers
are priests, equal before God.  Yet in practice, the standard,
traditional interpretation of the Bible is the true authority,
and to dissent from that interpretation (particularly if you act
upon it) will often result in church discipline, censure, and
possible expulsion, as the pastor alone is really in charge of
things.  Where then is biblical authority?  Where then is soul
liberty?  Where then is the priesthood of all believers? They
are swallowed in doublethink.  
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What is in our heads rarely matches our practice, and often contradicts
other ideas in our heads.  Humans are strange that way.  Listen
to George Orwell:
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Party said that Oceania had never been in alliance with Eurasia.
 He, Winston Smith, knew that Oceania had been in alliance with
Eurasia as short a time as four years ago.  But where did that
knowledge exist?  Only in his own consciousness, which in any
case must soon be annihilated.  And if all others accepted the
lie which the Party imposed - if all records told the same tale
- then the lie passed into history and became truth.  &quot;Who
controls the past,&quot; ran the Party slogan, &quot;controls
the future: who controls the present controls the past.&quot;
 And yet the past, though of its nature alterable, never had been
altered. Whatever was true now was true from everlasting to everlasting.
It was quite simple. All that was needed was an unending series
of victories over your own memory.  &quot;Reality control,&quot;
they called it; in Newspeak, &quot;doublethink.&quot;  
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Stand easy!&quot; barked the instructress, a little more
genially. Winston sank his arms to his sides and slowly refilled
his lungs with air.  His mind slid away into the labyrinthine
world of doublethink.  To know and not to know, to be conscious
of complete truthfulness while telling carefully constructed lies,
to hold simultaneously two opinions which canceled out, knowing
them to be contradictory and believing in both of them, to use
logic against logic, to repudiate morality while laying claim
to it, to believe that democracy was impossible and that the Party
was the guardian of democracy, to forget whatever it was necessary
to forget, then to draw it back into memory again at the moment
when it was needed, and then promptly to forget it again, and
above all, to apply the same process to the process itself - that
was the ultimate subtlety: consciously to induce unconsciousness,
and then, once again, to become unconscious of the act of hypnosis
you had just performed. Even to understand the word &quot;doublethink&quot;
involved the use of doublethink.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<I>c. The Principle of the Excluded Middle</I>
<P>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The principle of the excluded middle asserts that &quot;any statement
is either true or false&quot;.  Some have objected that if this
principle is accepted one is forced into a &quot;two-valued orientation&quot;
which implies that everything is &quot;either-or&quot;, with no
middle ground possible.  Such an objection results from a misunderstanding
of the principle.  If you have something that is gray, for instance,
the statements &quot;this is black&quot; or &quot;this is white&quot;
are both false.  When faced with a situation where one is given
such statements, &quot;this is white&quot; or &quot;this is black&quot;,
while both statements cannot be true, they very easily might both
be false.  
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When one restricts oneself to statements that are unambiguous
and precise, then the principle of excluded middle is perfectly
valid.  In other words, what this principle asserts is that <I>real</I>
contradiction is not possible, only <I>apparent</I> contradiction,
the result of limited language or data.  By the principle of excluded
middle, when faced with the question of whether light is made
of waves or particles, since the experiments contradict each other,
it is best to assume that light is neither wave nor particle,
but something else: GRAY.

<i><b>4. God Exists</b></i>

<P>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Bible should not be viewed as equivalent to a work of Shakespeare.

creation: it is the very Word of God - God's special revelation
of himself to the human race. 
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Above all, you must understand that no prophecy of Scripture

<P>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When something in the Bible seems contradictory, or when something

his or her own reasoning abilities and knowledge, since our reason

not question the reliability of the Bible.

 <BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So the Pharisees and teachers of the law asked Jesus, &quot;Why

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He replied &quot;Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you

For Moses said, 'Honor your father and mother,' and 'Anyone who
curses his father or mother must be put to death.'  But you say
that if a man says to his father or mother:  'Whatever help you

is, a gift devoted to God), then you no longer let him do anything
for his father or mother.  Thus you nullify the word of God by

<P>
<B>C. What is the Value of Tradition?</B>
<P>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What is tradition, and what value does it have?  These are two
questions that need to be asked now, as we think about how to
approach the text of scripture.  We all come to the Bible with
preconceived notions about the proper interpretation of given
passages.  How much weight should be allowed for that which &quot;has
always been taught&quot;?
<P>
<I><B>1. Definition of Tradition:</B></I>
<P>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The dictionary defines &quot;tradition&quot; as &quot;the handing
down of information, beliefs, and customs by word of mouth or
by example from one generation to another without written instruction.&quot;
 It can also be defined as &quot;an inherited pattern of thought
or action (as religious practice or social custom)&quot; or it
involves &quot;cultural continuity in social attitudes and institutions.&quot;
Tradition has been described as opinion which has the force of
habit behind it.  That is, the difference between opinion and
tradition is that an opinion belongs to an individual, while tradition
belongs to a group. 
<P>
<I><B>2. The Value of Tradition:  </B></I>
<P>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;James Barr has some interesting thoughts on tradition in his
book, <I>Holy Scripture: Canon, Authority, Criticism: </I>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In spite of what has been said about the positive importance
of tradition, and the way in which scripture emerged from tradition,
we do not suggest that Protestantism was wrong in claiming scripture
as its authority and in denying that tradition (after scripture)
could be placed on the same level as scripture or that tradition
should be allowed to decide what was the right exegesis of scripture.
 In all this Protestantism was in many ways right.  But Protestantism
is not proof against the vices which it itself set out to reform.
 It is perfectly possible today to reiterate the positions of
the older Protestant orthodoxy, to regard its judgments as virtually
final and to resist the possibility that they might be substantially
modified as a result of more modern research into scripture. 
What then happens is that the traditional &quot;Catholic&quot;
and &quot;Protestant&quot; roles come to be reversed: the facts
of scripture are once again obscured through the imposition of
a tradition, but this time it is not a medieval Catholic tradition,
it is a Protestant tradition, built  upon the insights of the
seventeenth century and anxious to maintain these insights against
the evidence of the text of scripture or at least against the
fact that quite different interpretations of the text are possible.
 When one looks at the various &quot;conservative&quot;, &quot;orthodox&quot;,
or &quot;evan-gelical&quot; schemes of doctrine which are so influential
today, and all of which energetically proclaim the authority of
scripture as their first principle, it requires no great insight
to see that in many cases it is &quot;conservatism&quot; or &quot;Calvinism&quot;,
or &quot;evangelicalism&quot; that is the actual authority, which
is the real dominant power.  The Bible is fully authoritative,
but it does not have authority to question the accepted doctrinal
tradition.  This is analogous to the late medieval position against
which the Reformers protested.
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Biblical authority on Protestant terms (on Catholic or Orthodox
terms it may be otherwise) exists only where one is free, on the
ground of scripture, to question, to adjust, and if necessary
to abandon the prevailing doctrinal traditions.  Where this freedom
does not exist, however much the Bible is celebrated, its authority
is in fact submitted to the power of doctrine and interpretation....If
the Bible says a certain thing, but says it only when understood
through an existentialist interpretation, or through a Calvinist
interpretation, then it becomes very doubtful whether the Protestant
appeal to scripture can be maintained at all.... </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What does the Bible have to say about the value of tradition?
 Without exception it is viewed as a corrupting influence.
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;See to it that no one takes you captive through hollow and deceptive
philosophy, which depends on human tradition and the basic principles
of this world rather than on Christ.  (Colossians 2:8)
<P>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For you have heard of my previous way of life in Judaism, how
intensely I persecuted the church of God and tried to destroy
it. I was advancing in Judaism beyond many Jews of my own age
and was extremely zealous for the traditions of my fathers.  (Galatians
1:13-14)</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Notice also Mark 7:1-13, and the parallel passage, Matthew 15:1-9.
 It is a great challenge to find anything positive about tradition
in the Bible: there simply isn't anything.  It must be noticed
that Christ's condemnation of traditions involved the interpretations
of the Bible which had become traditional.  When asked to explain
the why of an interpretation, the worst imaginable answers are
&quot;That is what I was told&quot;, or &quot;That is what the
Church has always believed.&quot;  
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In a Sunday School lesson regarding a passage in Isaiah several
students disagreed with the teacher's interpretation of the text.
 Unfortunately, the arguments brought against the teacher's interpretation
were based not on the Bible, but on tradition.  
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One student expressed the fear that if we were to question all
the traditions, we would then have nothing to believe in.  Another
wondered whether a small Sunday School class shouldn't be hesitant
to postulate something different from the generally accepted view.
 &quot;Who are we to go against tradition?&quot;
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I was reminded of the criticisms voiced against Martin Luther
and his radical insistence on &quot;Only Scripture&quot; and &quot;salvation
by faith&quot;, that such beliefs were contrary to the established
traditions of the church.  Several students reacted by saying,
&quot;Well, that's different. Luther was right and those traditions
of the Catholic Church were obviously wrong.&quot;  Ah, how easy
to see the speck in the eye of another!
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Attacking tradition results in the same criticism faced by Copernicus
as he demonstrated that the Sun was the center of the Solar System,
and not the Earth.  It is the same criticism faced by Martin Luther
King, Jr. as he tried to get a nation to accept Blacks as human
beings, deserving of equal respect and treatment.
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Tradition dies hard, and it complains a lot.
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;D.A. Carson, in his book <I>Exegetical Fallacies,</I> writes:
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Careful handling of the Bible will enable us to &quot;hear&quot;
it a little better.  It is all too easy to read the traditional
interpretations and invest them with a false, even idolatrous,
degree of certainty. Because traditions are reshaped as they are
passed on, after a while we may drift far from God's Word while
still insisting all our theological opinions are &quot;biblical&quot;
and therefore true.  If when we are in such a state we study the
Bible uncritically, more than likely it will simply reinforce
our errors.  If the Bible is to accomplish its work of continual
reformation - reformation in our lives and our doctrine - we must
do all we can to listen to it afresh, and utilize the best resources
at our disposal.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To appeal to tradition, to argue that because such and such an
idea has always been accepted, is to fall prey to the logical
fallacy of simplistic appeals to authority.  Again D.A. Carson:
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Such appeals can be to distinguished scholars, revered pastors,
cherished authors, the majority, or various others.  The fallacy
lies in thinking that appeals to authority constitute reasons
for interpreting texts a certain way; but in fact, unless that
authority's reasons are given, the only thing that such appeals
establish is that the writer is under the influence of the relevant
authority!  The most such an appeal can contribute to an argument
is to lend the authority's general reputation to its support;
but that is not so much a reasoned defense or explanation as a
kind of academic character reference. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The reader might also want to look at Psalm 118:8-9 and Jeremiah
