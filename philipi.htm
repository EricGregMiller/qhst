</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Philippi was located in Macedonia, about ten miles inland from
the Aegean Sea. It used to be called Krenides, which means &quot;springs&quot;,
but in 356 BC the name was changed by Philip II, king of Macedonia
from 359-336 BC and father of Alexander the Great. Paul had visited
Philippi on his second and third missionary journeys (see Acts
16:11-40, 20:6).
<P>
The letter was probably written sometime between AD 59 and 61,
during Paul's first imprisonment in Rome (Acts 28:11-31).
