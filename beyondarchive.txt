<b><h2>What is Beyond the Box?</h2></b><p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On Saturdays from 4:00 - 6:00 PM (U.S. Pacific Time) the faculty and students of <A HREF="http://www.theology.edu"> Quartz Hill School of Theology</a> will offer a weekly discussion format Internet Radio broadcast called <i>Beyond the Box</i>.  The broadcast will be conducted live. The program is hosted by <a href="http://www.qnet.com" target="NEW">Quantum Networking Solutions, Inc. (QNet)</a> on their website <a href="http://www.whatson.net" target="NEW">WhatsOn.net</a>.  <br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Theology is not a finished set of dogmatic propositions.  Rather, theology is a wide open field of endeavor.  God is not tame; he does not easily fit into a set of propositions, a simple equation, a small or large box.  Solomon, as he contemplated the temple he had built, stated: "But will God really dwell on earth? The heavens, even the highest heaven, cannot contain you. How much less this temple I have built!" (1 Kings 8:27; parallel account 1 Chronicles 6:18).  Metaphorically, we might argue the same.  God is infinite and we are finite, thus, we can only comprehend a finite portion of him.  There are more questions than answers in the field of theology.  Our job on this program (like the theology courses at Quartz Hill School of Theology), will be more to ask these endless questions, than to give settled answers.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The participants in the broadcast will include faculty and students of <A HREF="http://www.theology.edu"> Quartz Hill School of Theology</a>.
