<B>Lecture 2- The Theology of the Prophets</B>
<P>
<B> a. The Deuteronomist</B>
<P>
<B>ASSIGNMENT: Read Joshua through 2 Kings; and Von Rad, vol.
1, part 2, chapter C, section 6.</B>
<P>
 The Old Testament consists of great segments of literature that
have been edited in the final edition which we presently possess.
 The earliest writer is the anonymous theologian we call the Yahwist.
 He wrote around the time of David, and compiled the earliest
traditions in Genesis through Numbers.  The next theologian (also
anonymous) is called by scholars the Elohist.  He wrote some hundred
years after the Yahwist.  Then we have the Deuteronomist, who
wrote around the sixth century BC.  Then the Priestly writer,
and finally the Chronicler who wrote in the late 5th century BC.
 These great strands of theology have been woven together in the
great sources we find in the Old Testament.  In Gen through Numbers
we find the Yahwist, the Elohist, and the Priestly writer at work.
 In Deuteronomy through Kings the Deuteronomist is at work; and
in Ezra, Nehemiah, and 1-2 Chronicles the Chronicler is found.
 To these writings were eventually added the prophetic works and
the wisdom literature.
<P>
 Our present task is to investigate the work of the Deuteronomist.
 Why does he write what he does when he does?
<P>
 The sixth century BC was a terrible time for the people of Judah.
 Their Northern neighbors had been deported in 722 BC and they
were attacked and conquered in 587 BC.  So the Deuteronomist writes
to explain why it happened.  And the reason he gives is quite
simple -- the people had sinned against God and God had punished
them.
<P>
 I Ki 3:1ff is an excellent sample of the Deuteronomist's theology:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> Solomon made a marriage alliance with Pharaoh king of Egypt;
he took Pharaoh's daughter and brought her into the city of David,
until he had finished building his own house and the house of
the Lord and the wall around Jerusalem.  The people were sacrificing
at the high places, however, because no house had yet been built
for the name of the Lord.
<P>
 Solomon loved the Lord, walking in the statutes of his father
David; only,
he sacrificed and offered incense at the high places.  The king
went to Gibeon

to sacrifice there, for that was the principal high place; Solomon
used to

offer a thousand burnt offerings on that altar.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 Even the great Solomon is guilty of offering incense at the high
places.
<P>
Now, of course, during the historical period of Solomon is was
quite normal and even expected that offerings would be given at
the high places.  It was only during the exile that a stigma attached
to this practice; so Solomon is guilty of a sin, not in his own
time, but in the time of the Deuteronomist.
<P>
 The Deuteronomist assembled annals, prophetic biography, temple
chronicles and other historical material and molded them into
his own theological image.  This is especially true of the central
Deuteronomistic tendency to maintain that there is only one legitimate
place where Yahweh can be worshipped- the temple in Jerusalem.
 Thus, those who worshipped at other places were charged with
sin (cf.  1 Ki 15:26, 34;16:19, 26) and others.
<P>
 The ending of the Deutronomistic work holds the key to the whole
(2 Kings 25:1-30):
<P>
 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> And in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, on the
tenth day of the month, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came with
all his army against Jerusalem, and laid siege to it; they built
siegeworks against it all around.  So the city was besieged until
the eleventh year of King Zedekiah.  On the ninth day of the fourth
month the famine became so severe in the city that there was no
food for the people of the land.  Then a breach was made in the
city wall; the king with all the soldiers fled by night by the
way of the gate between the two walls, by the king's garden, though
the Chaldeans were all around the city. They went in the direction
of the Arabah.  But the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king,
and overtook him in the plains of Jericho; all his army was scattered,
deserting him.  Then they captured the king and brought him up
to the king of Babylon at Riblah, who passed sentence on him.
 They slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, then put
out the eyes of Zedekiah; they bound him in fetters and took him
to Babylon.  
<P>
 In the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month -- which
was the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon
-- Nebuzaradan, the captain of the bodyguard, a servant of the
king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem.  He burned the house of the
Lord, the king's house, and all the houses of Jerusalem; every
great house he burned down.  All the army of the Chaldeans who
were with the captain of the guard broke down the walls around
Jerusalem.  Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried into
exile the rest of the people who were left in the city and the
deserters who had defected to the king of Babylon -- all the rest
of the population.  But the captain of the guard left some of
the poorest people of the land to be vinedressers and tillers
of the soil.
<P>
 The bronze pillars that were in the house of the Lord, as well
as the stands and the bronze sea that were in the house of the
Lord, the Chaldeans broke in pieces, and carried the bronze to
Babylon.  They took away the pots, the shovels, the snuffers,
the dishes for incense, and all the bronze vessels used in the
temple service, as well as the firepans and the basins. What was
made of gold the captain of the guard took away for the gold,
and what was made of silver, for the silver. 
<P>
 As for the two pillars, the one sea, and the stands, which Solomon
had made for the house of the Lord, the bronze of all these vessels
was beyond weighing.  The height of the one pillar was eighteen
cubits, and on it was a bronze capital; the height of the capital
was three cubits; latticework and pomegranates, all of bronze,
were on the capital all around. The second pillar had the same,
with the latticework.
<P>
 The captain of the guard took the chief priest Seraiah, the second
priest Zephaniah, and the three guardians of the threshold;  from the
city he took an officer who had been in command of the soldiers,
and five men of the king's council who were found in the city;
the secretary who was the commander of  the army who mustered
the people of the land; and sixty men of the people of the land
who were found in the city. Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard
took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah.
The king of Babylon struck them down and put them to death at
Riblah in the land of Hamath. 
<P>
 So Judah went into exile out of its land.  
<P>
 He appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam son of Shaphan as governor
over the people who remained in the land of Judah, whom King Nebuchadnezzar
of Babylon had left.  Now when all the captains of the forces
and their men heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah
as governor, they came with their men to Gedaliah at Mizpah, namely,
Ishmael son of Nethaniah, Johanan son of Kareah, Seraiah son of
Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah son of the Maacathite.
 Gedaliah swore to them and their men, saying, &quot;Do not be
afraid because of the Chaldean officials; live in the land, serve
the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you.&quot; 
<P>
 But in the seventh month, Ishmael son of Nethaniah son of Elishama,
of the royal family, came with ten men; they struck down Gedaliah
so that he died, along with the Judeans and Chaldeans who were
with him at Mizpah.  Then all the people, high and low and the
captains of the forces set out and went to Egypt; for they were
afraid of the Chaldeans.
<P>
 In the thirty-seventh year of the exile of King Jehoiachin of
Judah, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-seventh day of the
month, King Evil-merodach of Babylon, in the year that he began
to reign, released King Jehoiachin of Judah from prison; he
spoke kindly to him, and gave him a seat above the other seats
of the kings who were with him in Babylon. So Jehoiachin put aside
his prison clothes. Every day of his life he dined regularly in
the king's presence.  For his allowance, a regular allowance was
given him by the king, a portion every day, as long as he lived.
<P></BLOCKQUOTE>
 Even though the nation is in exile, there is still hope, according
to the Deuteronomistic theologian.  If Israel would only be faithful
to Yahweh, all would be well.  That is the theology of the Deuteronomist.
<P>
<B>b) Isaiah through Malachi</B>
<P>
<B>ASSIGNMENT:  Read Isaiah through Malachi; von Rad, volume 2,
Part 1, chapters A-G.</B>
<P>
 The Deuteronomist concluded his work with 2 Kings.  In the Hebrew
Bible this is immediately followed by the so called &quot;writing prophets&quot;
or Isaiah through Malachi. This is the segment which we will now investigate.
<P>
 Ex 4:16 gives a very simple definition of what it means to be
a prophet.  The Hebrew word &quot;<I>navi</I>&quot; is translated
by the Greek words &quot;<I>pro</I>&quot; and &quot;<I>phiemi</I>&quot;.
 This Hebrew word literally means &quot;to bubble forth, to express&quot;.
 Likewise the Greek words mean &quot;to speak to or towards&quot;.
 Thus a prophet is not a foreteller of the future;  but a forthteller,
one who speaks to someone on behalf of someone else.
<P>
 Many Old Testament scholars believe that originally prophets
were part of the servants of the local sanctuary.  That is, they
were oracle givers at the local shrine, while the priests handled
the sacrificial side of the &quot;business&quot; (cf. Jer 29:24ff,
and I Sam 10:10ff.).  But prophets evidently also served as leaders
in times of war, leading the army of God into battle and blessing
them as they go (cf. I Kin 20:13-14, 22, 28,  22:6, 12, 15,20
2 Kin 3:16-17, 6:9).
<P>
 One of the most interesting aspects of the prophetic literature
is the fact that prophets were active primarily during the monarchy.
 That is, before the time that Israel had a King there is no prophetic
activity to speak of; and after the demise of the Kingship there
are only a few prophets active, and they minor ones at best. 
It seems, then, that prophecy was a counterbalance to the possible
abuse of power which a monarchy carried in its wake.  Thus it
is safe to say that when one reads the prophets one must understand
their theology as essentially anti-monarchy!  Israel was better
off, in the minds of the prophets, when God alone was their leader
(as in the wilderness).  Kings bring only trouble.  Even David
led the nation astray.
<P>
 Prophets speak for God.  The following texts are ample proof
of this:
<P>
<B>Amos 7:1-17</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> This is what the Lord God showed me: he was forming locusts at
the time the latter growth began to sprout (it was the latter
growth after the king 's mowings). When they had finished eating
the grass of the land, I said, &quot;O Lord God, forgive, I beg
you!  How can Jacob stand? He is so small!&quot;
<P>
 The Lord relented concerning this; &quot;It shall not be,&quot;
said the Lord.
<P>
 This is what the Lord God showed me: the Lord God was calling
for a shower
<P>
of fire, and it devoured the great deep and was eating up the
land. Then I said, &quot;O Lord God, cease, I beg you! How can
Jacob stand? He is so small!&quot;
<P>
 The Lord relented concerning this; &quot;This also shall not
be,&quot; said the Lord God.
<P>
 This is what he showed me: the Lord was standing beside a wall
built with a plumb line, with a plumb line in his hand.  And the
Lord said to me, &quot;Amos, what do you see?&quot; 
<P>
 And I said, &quot;A plumb line.&quot; 
<P>
 Then the Lord said, &quot;See, I am setting a plumb line in the
midst of my people Israel; I will never again pass them by; the
high places of Isaac shall be made desolate,

and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste, and I will
rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.&quot;
<P>
 Then Amaziah, the priest of Bethel, sent to King Jeroboam of
Israel,  saying, &quot;Amos has conspired against you in the very
center of the house of Israel; the land is not able to bear all
his words. For thus Amos has said, 'Jeroboam shall die by the
sword, and Israel must go into exile away from his land.'&quot;
<P>
 And Amaziah said to Amos, &quot;O seer, go, flee away to the
land of Judah, earn your bread there, and prophesy there;  but
never again prophesy at Bethel, for it is the king's sanctuary,
and it is a temple of the kingdom.&quot;  
<P>
 Then Amos answered Amaziah, &quot;I am no prophet, nor a prophet's
son; but I am a herdsman, and a dresser of sycamore trees,  and
the Lord took me from following the flock, and the Lord said to
me, 'Go, prophesy to my people Israel.'
<P>
 &quot;Now therefore hear the word of the Lord. You say, 'Do not
prophesy against Israel, and do not preach against the house of
Isaac.'
<P>
 Therefore thus says the Lord:
<P>
 'Your wife shall become a prostitute in the city,
<P>
 and your sons and your daughters shall fall by the sword,
<P>
 and your land shall be parceled out by line;
<P>
 you yourself shall die in an unclean land,
<P>
 and Israel shall surely go into exile away from its land.'&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<B>Isaiah 6:1-13</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>   In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting on
a throne, high and lofty; and the hem of his robe filled the temple.
 Seraphs were in attendance above him; each had six wings: with
two they covered their faces, and with two they covered their
feet, and with two they flew. And one called to another and
said:
<P>
 &quot;Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts; 
<P>
 the whole earth is full of his glory.&quot;
<P>
 The pivots on the thresholds shook at the voices of those who
called, and the house filled with smoke.
<P>
 And I said: &quot;Woe is me! I am lost, for I am a man of unclean
lips, and I live among a people of unclean lips; yet my eyes have
seen the King, the Lord of hosts!&quot;
<P>
 Then one of the seraphs flew to me, holding a live coal that
had been taken from the altar with a pair of tongs.  The seraph
touched my mouth with it and said: &quot;Now that this has touched
your lips, your guilt has departed and your sin is blotted out.&quot;

<P>
 Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying, &quot;Whom shall I
send, and who will go for us?&quot; 
<P>
 And I said, &quot;Here am I; send me!&quot;
<P>
 And he said, &quot;Go and say to this people:
<P>
 'Keep listening, but do not comprehend;
<P>
 keep looking, but do not understand.'
<P>
 Make the mind of this people dull,
<P>
 and stop their ears,
<P>
 and shut their eyes,
<P>
 so that they may not look with their eyes,
<P>
 and listen with their ears,
<P>
 and comprehend with their minds,
<P>
 and turn and be healed.&quot;
<P>
 Then I said, &quot;How long, O Lord?&quot; And he said:
<P>
 &quot;Until cities lie waste
<P>
 without inhabitant,
<P>
 and houses without people,
<P>
 and the land is utterly desolate;
<P>
 until the Lord sends everyone far away,
<P>
 and vast is the emptiness in the midst of the land.
<P>
 Even if a tenth part remain in it,
<P>
 it will be burned again,
<P>
 like a terebinth or an oak
<P>
 whose stump remains standing
<P>
 when it is felled.
<P>
 The holy seed is its stump.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Jeremiah 1:1-19
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> The words of Jeremiah son of Hilkiah, of the priests who were
in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin, to whom the word of the Lord
came in the days of King Josiah son of Amon of Judah, in the thirteenth
year of his reign. It came also in the days of King Jehoiakim
son of Josiah of Judah, and until the end of the eleventh year
of King Zedekiah son of Josiah of Judah, until the captivity of
Jerusalem in the fifth month.
<P>
 Now the word of the Lord came to me saying, 
<P>
 &quot;Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, 
<P>
 and before you were born I consecrated you; 
<P>
 I appointed you a prophet to the nations.&quot;
<P>
 Then I said, &quot;Ah, Lord God! Truly I do not know how to speak,
for I am  only a
boy.&quot; 
<P>
 But the Lord said to me, &quot;Do not say, 'I am only a boy';
for you shall go to all to whom I send you, and you shall speak
whatever I command you. Do not be afraid of them, for I am with
you to deliver you,&quot;
says the Lord.
<P>
 Then the Lord put out his hand and touched my mouth; and the
Lord said to me, &quot;Now I have put my words in your mouth.
 See, today I appoint you over nations and over kingdoms, to pluck
up and to pull down, to destroy and to overthrow, to build and
to plant.&quot;
<P>
 The word of the Lord came to me, saying, &quot;Jeremiah, what
do you see?&quot;
<P>
 And I said, &quot;I see a branch of an almond tree.&quot;
<P>
 Then the Lord said to me, &quot;You have seen well, for I am
watching over my word to perform it.&quot;
<P>
 The word of the Lord came to me a second time, saying, &quot;What
do you see?&quot; 
<P>
 And I said, &quot;I see a boiling pot, tilted away from the north.&quot;
<P>
 Then the Lord said to me: Out of the north disaster shall break
out on all the
inhabitants of the land.  For now I am calling all the tribes
of the kingdoms of the
north, says the Lord; and they shall come and all of them shall
set their thrones at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, against
all its surrounding walls and against all the cities of Judah.
 And I will utter my judgments against them, for all their wickedness
in forsaking me; they have made offerings to other gods, and worshipped
the works of their own hands.  But you, gird up your loins; stand
up and tell them everything that I command you. Do not break down
before them,  or I will break you before them.  And I for my part
have made you today a  fortified city, an iron pillar, and a bronze
wall, against the whole land -- against the kings of Judah, its
princes, its priests, and the people of the land.  They will fight
against you; but they shall not prevail against you, for I am
with you, says the Lord, to deliver you.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 Yet, even though the prophet spoke for God it was not always
(or ever) an easy path.  The were denounced by their own families,
harassed by their compatriots, and many of them were killed rather
violently (cf. Jer 15:17,  20:7,  Amos 3:8). They spoke, indeed,
but it was very difficult for them.
<P>
 And what did they say?  They warned the people of Israel that
God's just judgment would come upon them unless they repented.
 And when they did not repent and were judged, then the prophets
encouraged them with the idea that God had not utterly abandoned
them.  In short, they preached judgment and hope (cf. Jer 21:1-10).
<P>
 The theology of the prophets is thus a twofold message: (1) repent
or be judged, and, (2) judgment has come and God still loves you.
 Each of the 3 major and 12 minor prophets can be understood quite
well under this paradigm.
<P>
 Of course each prophet has a distinctive way of presenting this
twofold message.  For an in depth discussion of each, one must
read a good commentary on the individual books of the prophets.
 I recommend the volumes of the &quot;Old Testament Library&quot;
published by Westminster/John Knox.
