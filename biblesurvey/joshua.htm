<B>The Former Prophets</B> 
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The second division of the Hebrew Old Testament is called <I>Neviim</I>
in Hebrew; this is translated into English as &quot;Prophets&quot;.
This section is itself broken into two subsections, the Former
Prophets and the Latter Prophets.
<P>

<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ordinarily, English speaking Christians do not think of the books of Joshua, Judges, 1-2 Samuel and 1-2 Kings as prophetic works, but
this is the way they were classified in the Hebrew Bible. Only the
Latter Prophets, which follow them, are the books Christians more traditionally
think of as prophetic (Isaiah- Malachi). However, when one considers
the important role such prophets as Samuel, Elijah, Elisha and
Nathan played in those books Christians call History, the Hebrew classification begins
to make more sense. Furthermore, it should be noted that these
Former Prophets were not presenting plain history; rather, they
had a prophetic purpose in mind: to proclaim God's actions
in the life of his chosen people.
<P>
<B>The Book of Joshua</B> 
<P>
<B>I. Title</B> 
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The English title &quot;Joshua&quot; is the same in both the Hebrew
original and in the Greek translation. It was derived from the
content of the book, rather than from its author.
<P>
<B>II. Author</B> 
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The author of the book is unknown. However, Joshua 5:1 states
that:<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now when all the Amorite kings west of the Jordan and all the
Canaanite kings along the seacoast heard how the Lord had dried
up the Jordan before the Israelites until we had crossed over,
their hearts sank and they no longer had the courage to face the
Israelites.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Also, in 5:6:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For the Lord had sworn to them that they would not see the land
that he had solemnly promised their fathers to give us, a land
flowing with milk and honey.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Therefore, the use of the first person plural pronoun would seem
to indicate that the author of Joshua was an eyewitness to the
events described.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; While the book was written by an eyewitness, it seems unlikely
that this eyewitness was Joshua. 15:13-19 and 19:47 contain accounts
of the conquest of Hebron by Caleb, Debir by Othniel, and Leshem
by the tribe of Dan. Considered alone, these conquests could have
happened before Joshua died. But if these accounts are compared
with the parallel accounts of the same conquests in Judges 1:1-15,
there can be little doubt that the battles described occurred
following Joshua's death.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The question then arises: just how long after Joshua's death was
the book written? Caleb's conquest of Hebron must have occurred
a very short time after Joshua's demise. After all, Caleb was
eighty-five years old at this time.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In addition, there seems to be distinct evidence that the book
was written before, not after the establishment of the monarchy
in Israel, contrary to what some critics have inferred.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In Joshua 16:10 the Canaanites are still in Gezer. However, by
the end of David's reign they were gone (1 Kings 9:16). In Joshua
15:63 the Jebusites were still in Jerusalem. However, when David
began to reign over the united kingdom, the Jebusites were gone
(2 Samuel 5:3, 6-9). Furthermore, the book of Joshua shows no
traces of a later time, either in style or content. It is closely
connected with the Pentateuch in language as well as viewpoint.
For example, the only Phoenicians mentioned are the Sidonians,
and they are considered a part of the Canaanites who were to be
destroyed (13:4-6). By the time of David, circumstances had changedcompletely. Also, Sidon is referred to as the chief city of the
Phoenicians, and the epithet &quot;great&quot; is applied to it
in 11:8 and 19:28. But, in the days of David, Tyre was the most
prominent Phoenician city.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Therefore, it seems likely that the book of Joshua was written
within twenty or twenty-five years of the death of Joshua, probably
by one of the elders who crossed the Jordan with him, and had
taken part in the conquest of Canaan (5:1 and 6), but survived
a long time after (12:31 and Judges 2:7).
