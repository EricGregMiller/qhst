<B>The Book of James</B> 
<P>
<B>I. Title</B> 
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The title comes from the name of the author of this letter.
<P>
<B>II. Author and Setting</B> 
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; According to James 1:1, the letter was written by James:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ,
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To the twelve tribes scattered among the nations:
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Greetings.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Questions arise as to the identification of this James. Tradition
holds to this being James the Apostle, that is, the brother of
Jesus (Mark 6:3), who was the ruling elder in the Jerusalem church
before his martyrdom AD 62. A date prior to the council of Jerusalem
of AD 48/49 (Acts 15) is very possible, making this the oldest
book in the New Testament.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The other possibility, that it was written by James son of Zebedee,
is unlikely, since he was martyred about AD 44, which was probably
too early for a letter like this to have been written.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The book falls into the category or genre of wisdom literature.
For more information on wisdom literature, see the discussion
on Proverbs.

<B>Questions on James</B> 
<P><blockquote>
1. Compare and contrast James' use of Abraham in James 2:20-24
and Paul's use in Galatians 3:6-14 and Romans 4. Is there a contradiction?
<br>
2. Is James advocating salvation by works? Why or why not?
<br>
3. Discuss James' teaching on the tongue. <p>
