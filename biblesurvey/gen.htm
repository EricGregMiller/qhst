<center><B>The Law</B> </center>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The first of the three major divisions of the Hebrew Bible is
called <I>Torah</I> in Hebrew; this is normally translated with
the English word &quot;Law&quot;. The Law is made up of the five
books of Moses, also known as the Pentateuch: Genesis, Exodus,
Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Moses is traditionally assumed to be the author of the book of
the Pentateuch, though he is nowhere in scripture specifically
identified as its author. However the New Testament repeatedly
speaks about &quot;Moses&quot; in the sense of the author of the
Torah (the Pentateuch -- the first five books of the Bible).
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Another explanation for the authorship of the books of the Law
has developed over the last hundred fifty years. It is widely
held by those who do not believe that the Bible is the word of
God. Called the Documentary Hypothesis, it was developed by a
German scholar named Wellhausen and assumes the five books of
Moses were composed over a period of several hundred years, not
reaching their final form until the time of Ezra (c. 500 B.C.).
It supposes four major documents used in the composition, labeled
J, E, P, and D.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>J</B> (from the divine name Yahweh -- in German, <I>Jahweh</I>);
it is said to originate in Judah between 950 and 850 B.C. and
pieces of it are scattered in sections from Genesis through Numbers.
<p>
<B>E</B> (the Elohistic source, from the prevalence of the word
<I>Elohim</I>); it is said to originate in the northern kingdom
of Israel between 850 and 750 BC. It too, is scattered from Genesis
through Numbers.
<p>
<B>P</B> (the Priestly source, so called because it seems most
concerned with aspects of the formal worship in the temple); it
is said to come from the exile or shortly thereafter -- sixth
to fifth centuries B.C. It is made up of the genealogies and priestly
ritual described in Genesis through Numbers.
<p>
Finally, <B>D</B>, (the Deuteronomic source, so called because
it includes mostly just the book of Deuteronomy); the author or
editor of this section is assumed to be responsible for the framework
of the historical account that runs from Joshua through 2 Kings.
D is regarded as having reached its final form during the reign
of Josiah, when the priests &quot;found&quot; the book of the
law (2 Kings 22:3-23:25).

<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;While the Documentary Hypothesis is widely accepted by biblical
scholars (and is the theory to be found in popular literature
such as Encyclopedias and even magazines and newspapers), most
evangelical scholars reject it. The reason for their rejection
is twofold: the documentary hypothesis makes the Pentateuch a
lying fraud, and secondly, there is no objective evidence for
any of the supposed source documents. In fact, supposing such
a complex method of composition runs counter to what is known
about how all other Ancient Near Eastern documents were composed.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In recent years the documentary hypothesis was been severely criticized
for its subjectivity -- a serious failure on the part of a system
that aims for scientific objectivity; moreover, there is strong
evidence which supports the traditional view of mostly a single
author for the Pentateuch. For more information check the book
by Kikawada and Quinn, <I>Before Abraham Was</I>, published by
Abingdon in 1985.
<P>
<B>The Book of Genesis</B> 
<P>
<B>I. Title</B> 
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The English title comes from the Greek translation of the Old
Testament (the Septuagint). In Hebrew, the book's title is taken
from the first word in the book, <I>bereshit</I> -- which means
&quot;in the beginning&quot;.
<P>
<B>II. Author</B> 
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Moses is traditionally assumed to be the author of the book of
Genesis, though he is nowhere in scripture specifically identified
as its author. However the New Testament repeatedly speaks about
&quot;Moses&quot; in the sense of the author of the Torah (the
Pentateuch -- the first five books of the Bible), which would
of course include the book of Genesis. For more discussion of
the authorship question, please see the introduction to the Law.

<B>IV. Summary of the Most Common Interpretations of the Creation
Narrative:</B> 
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A. Creationism
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Takes the approach that the six days of Genesis 1 are to be understood
as actual twenty-four hour days. Holds to a basically chronological
approach to the creation narrative, and believes that the universe
as a whole came into being about six thousand years ago. Believes
that all the fossils were formed at the time of the Great Flood
of Noah.
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;B. Gap Theory
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Places a gap in the narrative either before Genesis 1:1 or between
Genesis 1:1 and 1:2; believes the universe was created approximately
twenty billion years ago, then suffered a cataclysmic destruction
at the time of Satan's rebellion, necessitating the reconstruction
of the Earth about six thousand years ago. The fossil records
illustrate the life forms prior to the reconstruction recorded
from Genesis 1:2 and following. In common with the Creationist
perspective, it holds that the six days are to be understood as
ordinary twenty-four hour days.
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;C. Theistic Evolution
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Believes that the six days of Genesis should be understood as
long periods of time, rather than twenty-four hour days. Believes
that God brought the universe into existence about twenty billion
years ago, and then made use of the evolutionary process to bring
forth life over an extended period. Does not view the creation
narrative as a chronological description of events.

<B>V. Thematic Arrangement of the Six Days</B> <p>
<blockquote>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B>1.</B> light/darkness &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>4.</B> sun/moon
and stars<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B>3.</B> dry land, vegetation &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B>6.</B> animals and
people<br>
</blockquote>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Notice that on days 1-3, empty places are made, while on days
4-6 the inhabitants to fill those empty places are made.

<B>VI. Topical Expansion in Hebrew Poetry and Narrative</B> 
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Not uncommonly in the Old Testament, you'll find the structure
of the text is similar to what you'd find in a newspaper article,
where the first line or paragraph summarizes the rest of the story.
Look at the following examples to get a sense of how this works
in the Bible.

<P>
1:1 In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<i>4. Ecclesiastes 2:1-26</i>
<P>
2:1 I spoke in my heart, &quot;Come now, I will test pleasure
<br>
and examine good.&quot;
<br>
Behold: all of it is also meaningless.<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
2:2-10 Testing with pleasure to discover what's good.
