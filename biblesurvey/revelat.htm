<B>The Book of Revelation</B> 
<P>
<B>I. Title</B> 
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The title comes from the first word in the letter, <I>apokalypsis</I>,
translated &quot;revelation&quot;. From the Greek word comes the
alternative title for the book: The Apocalypse. The Greek word
itself means &quot;to expose that which was formerly hidden, veiled
or secret&quot;. In the New Testament, it is used exclusively
in the religious sense of a divine disclosure.
<P>
<B>II. Author and Setting</B> <p>
<blockquote>
A. Author and Date
</blockquote>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The author of Revelation identifies himself as John in 1:1, 4,
9 and 22:8. Justine Martyr, Clement of Alexandria, Hippolytus,
and Origen attribute the authorship to John the Apostle, the son
of Zebedee. This seems reasonable, since the only other Johns
we know about in the New Testament are John the Baptist and John
Mark, neither of whom seems a likely candidate as the author,
anymore than the suggestion that it was written by another, otherwise
unknown person named John.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The language and grammatical style of Revelation are different
from what one finds in the Gospel of John and his three letters;
however the imagery, literary forms, liturgical framework and
symbolism bear a resemblance to what one finds in the other works
attributed to John. Perhaps the differences in language and style
can be explained by a different amanuensis.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is difficult to be precise on the date of the book of Revelation.
Dates of composition of either AD 54-68 or AD 81-96 seem most
likely.<p>

B. Interpretive Approaches
<BLOCKQUOTE>
1. Futurist
</BLOCKQUOTE></blockquote>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With the exception of chapters one through three, the book of
Revelation is to be understood as describing the period around
the second advent of Jesus Christ and the end of the age. The
seals, the bowls, the trumpets, the plagues refer to events yet
to be. The beasts of chapters thirteen and seventeen relate to
the coming Antichrist. Antichrist will arise just before the end
of all things, and then Jesus will arrive, defeat him, and set
up his earthly millennial kingdom.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is the viewpoint held by early expositors such as Justin Martyr
(died AD 165), Irenaeus (died about AD 195), Hippolytus (died
AD 236) and Victorinus (died about AD 303). Today, it is the most
popular view among evangelical Christians.<p>
<blockquote><BLOCKQUOTE>
2. Historicist
</BLOCKQUOTE></blockquote>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; An interpretation that apparently began with Joachim of Floris
who died in 1202. In his view, the book was a prophesy of the
events of Western history from the times of the apostles until
the end of time. Generally, the papacy is viewed as the Antichrist.
This interpretation was popular with the early reformers Luther
and Calvin.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is not a popular point of view today, principally because of
a lack of consensus among various exegetes as to the historical
identification of the various events in the book.<p>
<blockquote><BLOCKQUOTE>
3. Idealist
</BLOCKQUOTE></blockquote>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; An interpretation which takes Revelation as basically poetic,
symbolic and spiritual. The book of Revelation does not predict
any specific historical events, but rather simply sets forth the
timeless truths concerning the battle between good and evil that
rages throughout the church age. The approach is similar to the
general allegorizing principles of interpretation used during
the middle ages; it is not a particularly widely held viewpoint
today, again because of its general subjectivity and lack of consensus
among exegetes.<p>
<blockquote><BLOCKQUOTE>
4. Preterist
</BLOCKQUOTE></blockquote>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; An interpretation which sees Revelation as related to what happened
during the time it was written. The main contents of chapters
four through at least nineteen are viewed as describing events
that happened during the times of the Roman Empire, either during
the lifetime of John or shortly thereafter; the book of Revelation
is then seen as belonging to the genre of Jewish apocalyptic literature,
designed as a &quot;tract for the times&quot; to encourage faithfulness
during persecution. Only chapters nineteen through twenty-two
are viewed as still future in our day.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The beasts of chapters thirteen and seventeen are identified with
imperial Rome and the imperial priesthood.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The interpretation was apparently first developed about 1614 by
the Spanish Jesuit Alcasar. This is the view held by the majority
of scholars today.
