<B>The Book of Zechariah</B> 
<P>
<B>I. Title</B> 
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The title is the same in Hebrew as it is in the English and Greek
translations. The name Zechariah probably means &quot;Yahweh remembers&quot;.

<B>II. Author and Setting</B> <p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<i>
A. Author
</i>

<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The name Zechariah is a very common name in the Old Testament,
especially among the priests and Levites of the post-exilic period.
There are perhaps thirty different people mentioned in the Old
Testament by this name. Four of the most familiar would be:<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
1. A son of the high priest Jehoiada who was slain in the court
of the House of the Lord by order of King Joash (837-800 BC).
This Zechariah denounced the apostasy of Judah and preached God's
judgment against her (2 Chronicles 24:20-22).
<br>
2. A king of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, the son of Jereboam
II, who reigned only six months before being murdered in 745 BC
(2 Kings 14:29; 15:8, 11).
<br>
3. A son of Jeberechiah, one of the two men Isaiah chose to witness
when he wrote Maher-shalal-hash-baz on a large tablet (Isaiah
8:2).
<br>
4. The prophet, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, who began
prophesying in Judah about 520 BC. He is referred to as &quot;the
son of Berechia, the son of Iddo&quot; in Zechariah 1:1 and 7
and simply as &quot;the son of Iddo&quot; in Ezra 5:1 and 6:14.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For some reason, this difference, &quot;son of Berechia&quot;
or &quot;son of Iddo&quot; has caused concern among some commentators
and skeptics. Of course it is clear that &quot;son of Iddo&quot;
is simply an abbreviated genealogy, equivalent to calling Jesus
&quot;son of David&quot;.
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<i>
B. Date and Composition of the Book of Zechariah
</i>

<P>
The first eight chapters of Zechariah are nicely dated:<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
1. 1:1 -- the eighth month of the second year of Darius I, which
would be October, 520 BC.
<br>
2. 1:7 -- the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, in the
second year of Darius I, which would be February 15, 519 BC. This
date suggests that Zechariah saw all eight of his visions in one
night.
<br>
3. 7:1 -- the fourth year of King Darius I, in the fourth day
of the ninth month of Kislev, which would be December 7, 518 BC.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There are no dates given for chapters 9-14 and Zechariah's name
does not even appear in that section. Times have changed and there
is no reference made to Darius or any other king. The temple is
standing, instead of waiting to be built (cf. 9:8, 11:13-14, and
14:21). As a result, many scholars suggest that chapters 9-14
of Zechariah were not written by Zechariah at all.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There is very solid evidence to support this position.<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Matthew 27:9-10:
<p>
Then what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled: &quot;They
took the thirty silver coins, the price set on him by the people
of Israel, and they used them to buy the potter's field, as the
Lord commanded me.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The problem comes in locating this prophesy, which, rather than
appearing in the book of Jeremiah, instead shows up in Zechariah
11:12-13.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One thing to notice is that neither the Septuagint nor the Masoretic
text serve as Matthew's text. One possibility to explain the slightly
different wording is to suggest that Matthew made use of an Aramaic
Targum.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1. One common attempt to explain the introduction of Jeremiah's
name in place of that of Zechariah in Matthew, is to argue that,
so far as the principle features are concerned, this prophesy
is simply a resumption of the prophecy of Jeremiah 19, and that
Zechariah announces a second fulfillment of this prophecy (Hegstenberg),
or that it rests on the prophecy of Jeremiah 18, in which the
potter is also introduced, and that its fulfillment goes beyond
Zechariah's prophecy, so that Jeremiah 18 and 19 are fulfilled
at the same time.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Comparison is also sometimes made to Mark 1:2-3 where Mark states:<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It is written in Isaiah the prophet: &quot;I will send my messenger
ahead of you, who will prepare your way -- a voice of one calling
in the desert, 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths
for him.'&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Here, Mark has quoted from two separate passages in the Old Testament
and combined them: Malachi 3:1 and Isaiah 40:3. So, perhaps Matthew,
like Mark, quotes from both Zechariah and Jeremiah, and then names
only the more prominent of the two prophets.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unfortunately for this explanation, it works only in abstract;
it is difficult, if not impossible, to find even one word in the
context of what Matthew attributes to Jeremiah, actually in the
book of Jeremiah.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2. A second answer to the problem that has been suggested is that
Matthew is simply quoting from a now lost prophecy of Jeremiah,
or to a saying of Jeremiah's that was passed down by oral tradition.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unfortunately, this is a little too convenient, besides lacking
any substantive evidence.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3. &quot;Jeremiah&quot; is said to begin the Book of the Prophets
in the Hebrew canon, and that the use of this name is intended
simply to indicate that Matthew is quoting the prophetic section
of the Bible. In essence, then, this idea postulates that &quot;Jeremiah&quot;
is synonymous to &quot;the prophets&quot; in general.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unfortunately, Matthew does not follow this supposed practice
with his other Old Testament citations (and for that matter, neither
do any of the other New Testament writers -- cf. Romans 9:25 and
Acts 2:16). In Matthew 3:3, 4:14, 8:17, 12:17, 13:14 and 15:7
Matthew quotes Isaiah, and states that he is quoting Isaiah. He
does not announce that he is quoting from Jeremiah. In Matthew
2:17 he states that he is quoting from Jeremiah, and there he
actually does. In Matthew 12:39-41 and Matthew 16:4 he claims
to quote from Jonah -- and does.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As if that were not devastating enough to the theory, it should
also be noted that Jeremiah does not begin the Book of the Prophets
in the Hebrew Bible; rather, Joshua leads as the first book of
the section that the Jewish people labeled &quot;the Prophets&quot;,
dividing them into two sections, the Former Prophets (Joshua-Kings)
and the Latter Prophets (Isaiah-Malachi).
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;4. A fourth idea that has been postulated is to say that Jeremiah
in Matthew is simply an example of a transcription error on the
part of an early copyist. Unfortunately, all the manuscripts are
unanimous in the reading of Jeremiah's name in Matthew 27:9.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;5. Matthew simply made a mistake. Martin Luther wrote:<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This chapter gives rise to the question, Why did Matthew attribute
the text concerning the thirty pieces of silver to the prophet
Jeremiah, whereas it stands here in Zechariah? This and other
similar questions do not indeed trouble me very much, because
they have but little bearing upon the matter; and Matthew does
quite enough by quoting a certain scripture, although he is not
quite correct about the name, inasmuch as he quotes prophetic
sayings in other places, and yet does not give the words as they
stand in the scripture. The same thing may occur now; and if it
does not affect the sense that the words are not quoted exactly,
what is to hinder his not having given the name quite correctly,
since the words are of more importance than the name?
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unfortunately, taking Luther's position leaves us with an error
in the Bible, in one blow eliminating the doctrine of biblical
inerrancy.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;6. This leads us then, to the sixth and final possibility, which
is the one that will be used in this outline of the Bible: Matthew
is correct in attributing this to Jeremiah, and our understanding
of the book of Zechariah needs some modification.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The problem of the unity of Zechariah represents one of the earliest
critical problems in Old Testament studies. No serious question
was raised against Zechariah's authorship of the entire book until
the seventeenth century. Come AD 1638, a certain Cambridge theologian
pointed out that Matthew 27:9 quotes Zechariah 11:12 as having
been written by Jeremiah rather than Zechariah. The theologian's
name was Mede. He decided to depart from the tradition that Zechariah
wrote the whole book and wrote &quot;There is reason to suspect
that the Holy Spirit (through Matthew) desired to claim three
chapters 9, 10, 11 for their real author.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At first Mede denied that Zechariah wrote all of the book on a
scriptural basis. He wrote, &quot;There is no scripture sayeth
they (chaps. 9-11) are Zachary's, but here is scripture saith
they are Jeremy's as this of the evangelists.&quot; But Mede did
not base his view of Jeremiah's authorship of Zechariah 9-11 on
Matthew's reference alone. He also argued on the basis of internal
evidence in these chapters that they were earlier than the exilic
period. He said, &quot;Certainly, if a man weighs the contents
of some of them, they should in likelihood be of an elder date
than the time of Zachary, namely, before the captivity, for the
subjects of some of them were scarce in being after that time.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mede's suggestion did not attract attention until 1699 when Richard
Kidder, Lord Bishop of Bath and Wells, wrote, &quot;That Jeremy
wrote chapter 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 of Zachary is a very probable
opinion. This is certain, that such things are contained in those
chapters, as agree with the time of Jeremy, but by no means with
that of Zachary, e.g., that the pride of Assyria shall be brought
down, and the Septre of Egypt depart, is foretold Zech 10:11.
It is well known that this was past in Zachary's time. And tho'
Jeremy might, Zachary could not predict this.&quot; (Richard Kidder,
<I>A Demonstration of the Mesiah I-III</I>. London, 1664, 1700).
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So why would these sections by Jeremiah be added to the end of
a book by Zechariah? Because Zechariah was the last book of the
prophets! Zechariah 9-11, Zechariah 12-14, and Malachi (also three
chapters in Hebrew) are each called a <I>masa</I>, &quot;a burden&quot;.
Most scholars therefore believe that these were three floating
and anonymous oracles arbitrarily assigned to their present position
in the cannon. The third and last of these was given the title
&quot;Malachi&quot; from a word in Malachi 1:1 and 3:1, in order
to make twelve minor prophets. It is interesting to note that
each of these three sections begins with the exact same phrase:
&quot;<I>masa deber Yahweh</I>&quot; -- &quot;A burden of Yahweh&quot;.
