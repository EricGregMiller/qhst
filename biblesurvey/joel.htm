<B>The Book of Joel</B> 
<P>
<B>I. Title</B> 
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The name of the book is the same both in Hebrew and in the English
and Greek translations. The name Joel means &quot;Yahweh is God&quot;.
<P>
<B>II. Author and Setting</B> 
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Joel is a common name in the Old Testament, but the author of
this prophesy is mentioned nowhere else but here. He prophesied
to Judah and Jerusalem.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The date for Joel's prophesy is uncertain. Dates ranging from
the early pre-exilic to the late post-exilic period have been
postulated.<p>
<blockquote>
A. Early Date
<P>
1. Quotations of Joel appear in Isaiah, Micah, and Amos: Joel
3:10 is the same as Isaiah 2:4, which is also the same as Micah
4:3. Joel 3:16 is the same as Amos 1:2 and 4:8.
<br>
2. The enemies of Judah in Joel are the Phoenicians, Egyptians,
Greeks and Edomites, rather than the Assyrians and Babylonians.
<br>
3. No mention of a king or princes in the book suggests a date
during the early part of Joash's reign, when he was a minor under
the guardianship of Jehiada the high priest.
<p>
B. Late Date
<P>
1. Judah is called Israel in 3:1 and 2 and 2:27, suggesting at
least a date after 722 BC (after the fall of the Northern Kingdom).
<br>
2. Assyria and Babylon are not mentioned, suggesting a date after
the fall of Babylon to Cyrus in 539 BC.
<br>
3. Joel could just as easily be quoting from Isaiah, Micah and
Amos, as they from he.
<br>
4. The historical allusion of 3:2 seems most naturally to refer
to the fall of Jerusalem in 587 BC.
<br>
5. No king of Israel is mentioned, which would be reasonable assuming
a post-exilic date, when Israel had no kings.
<br>
6. There is no mention of a locust plague in the books of 1-2
Kings or 1-2 Chronicles, despite the fact that Joel describes
this plague as one that would never be forgotten and one that
would be remembered and talked about forever.
<br>
7. There is no mention of the sin of idolatry, one of the central
issues for pre-exilic prophets, and the most notable feature to
distinguish pre exilic from post-exilic prophets.</blockquote>
<P>
<B>III. The Day of the Lord</B> 
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It should be noted that the use of the phrase &quot;Day of the
Lord&quot; or &quot;Day of Yahweh&quot; is not automatically a
reference to the end of the world. Rather, it was used to describe
any period when God was acting in bringing judgment against a
people. Below is a listing of all the occurrences of the phrase
in the Bible. A perusal should give the reader a good overview
of the range of meanings for the phrase.
