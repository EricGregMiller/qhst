</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Based on 1:3 it is suggested that Paul was writing from Macedonia,
while Timothy was in Ephesus; Paul wrote the letter after his
first imprisonment in Rome as recorded at the end of the book
of Acts. Therefore, it was likely written sometime between AD
62 and 67.
