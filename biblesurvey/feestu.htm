<h3><B>Section One: <br>Questions on <I>How to Read the Bible for All
Its Worth</I> by Fee and Stuart</B></h3> </center>
<P>
<B>Instructions</B> 
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It is important that you answer the questions in your own words;
this demonstrates that you understand the concepts. Simply quoting
from the book will not be considered adequate. Answers to all
questions should be at least a paragraph (that is, at least five
typewritten lines) long. Some questions, to be adequately answered,
will require considerably more than this.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Be sure to read each chapter's questions before you read the relevant
chapter. This will help guide your reading, giving you some idea
what to expect from the chapter.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Remember, your purpose here is to learn, not simply to complete
a set of requirements. Your goal is an education, not units and
a grade.
