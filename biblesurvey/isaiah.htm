<B>The Latter Prophets</B> 
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<I>[The Pentateuch] stands by itself as perfectly unique -- the
original record which regulated on all sides the being and life
of Israel as to chosen nation, and to which all other prophesy
in Israel stood in a derivative relation.</I> 
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; --Franz Delitzsch
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To understand the prophetic books of the Old Testament, it is
important to recognize that:
<P><blockquote>
1. The prophets were not innovators. Their message depended and
was derived from the messages that had gone before, especially
the word of God as given in the five books of Moses.
<br>
2. Therefore, in order to comprehend the prophetic books, it is
absolutely vital that the reader know the Pentateuch.<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
a. God is the God of the whole human race (Gen. 1-9)
<br>
b. There are no other gods but Yahweh (Deut. 6:4)
<br>
c. Love is the cause and purpose of the covenant God made with Israel (Deuteronomy 7:7-11)
<br>
d. Therefore, the Covenant forms the basis of God's dealings with Israel and Judah (Deuteronomy 27-30).

<B>The Book of Isaiah</B> 
<P>
<B>I. Title</B> 
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The title of the book is derived from the name of the author;
Isaiah's name, like Joshua's, means &quot;Yahweh saves&quot;,
&quot;Yahweh is salvation&quot; or &quot;Salvation of Yahweh&quot;.
<P>
<B>II. Author and Setting</B> <p>
<blockquote>
A. Introduction
</blockquote>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Isaiah was the son of Amoz. Nothing is known about his father,
Amoz, beyond his name. Isaiah mentions two sons in his book: Maher-shalal-hash-baz,
which means &quot;Hasten spoil, quick booty&quot; and She'ar-Yashub,
which means &quot;a remnant shall remain&quot;. Isaiah prophesied
mainly in Jerusalem. Based on his vocabulary usage and style,
it seems clear that Isaiah was very well educated. According to
Jewish tradition found in the Mishna, Manasseh stuck Isaiah in
a hollow tree and then sawed him in half as punishment for opposing
him (cf. Hebrews 11:37).<p>
<blockquote>
B. Authorship Problem
</blockquote>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1. Since the rise of higher criticism in the nineteenth century,
the majority opinion has been to divide Isaiah into two parts,
and to postulate two authors. Chapters 1-39, so the theory goes,
were written by Isaiah son of Amoz in the eighth century BC. Chapters
40-66 were then composed by the so-called &quot;Second Isaiah&quot;,
an anonymous writer, living during or shortly after the time of
the Babylonian Exile.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The reasons for this belief in a multiple authorship of Isaiah
are as follows:
<P><blockquote>
a. the philosophic denial of the possibility of predictive prophesy.
<br>
b. Anti-Semitism in 19th century Germany.   When the theory was
developed, anti-semites had as their goal the elimination of any
claim to greatness by Jews and Judaism. Therefore, they attempted
to discredit the reliability and veracity of the Old Testament.
This point is made by Rachel Margalioth in her book, <I>The Indivisible
Isaiah</I>, New York: Yeshiva University; Jerusalem: Sura Institute
for Research, 1964:<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;One of the principle incentives for splitting up the book
is the anti-Semitic factor. The German professors, Marti, Duhm,
and their colleagues, evolved a system proclaiming the &quot;true&quot;
Isaiah, who lived in the days of Hezekiah, the prophet of doom
of the Jewish people: <I>'der Prophet des Endes dieses Volkes
Judas.'</I>In the opinion of Marti and his colleagues the people
of Israel have no future whatsoever in the outlook of the 'true'
Isaiah. He prophesied utter doom and destruction, leaving them
no remnant, name, or vestige. Thus all expressions of consolation
scattered through the book must necessarily be later additions...&quot;
(p. 17)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
c. the difference in literary style between chapters 1-39 and
chapters 40-66. 
<br>
d. theological differences between the two halves.</blockquote>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2. The older tradition, of course, is to accept the claim of authorship
for Isaiah, and to insist on a single author for the entire book.
The reasons for rejecting the concept of two Isaiahs are as follows:
<P><blockquote>
a. acceptance of the possibility of predictive prophesy.
<br>
b. the subjectivity of the new tradition lacks the firm ground
of objective, unambiguous fact.
<br>
c. unbroken Jewish tradition argues for a single author for the
book.</blockquote>
<P>
<blockquote>
C. Historical Setting
</blockquote>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If the traditional authorship of Isaiah is accepted, it is a compilation
of a series of prophesies Isaiah received and committed to writing
over the years 740 to 690 BC. At the same time he was prophesying
in Judah, Amos and Hosea were busy in the Northern Kingdom of
Israel; Micah was writing in the south. Isaiah's prophetic work
was composed during the reigns of the following kings (see 2 Kings
15:8-21:18):<p>

D. Political Situation
</blockquote>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1. Assyria was gaining momentum and strength in the west as a
major world power. In Isaiah's lifetime, the Northern Kingdom
of Israel, as a separate political entity, came to an end. Tiglath-Pileser
III invaded Gilead and the Northern Kingdom in 734; its capital,
Samaria, finally fell between 724- 722 BC.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2. Sennacherib invaded Judah, the Southern Kingdom, in 701 BC.<p>
<blockquote>
E. Spiritual Situation
</blockquote>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Degeneracy and official sanction of idolatry in Judah during the
reigns of Ahaz and Manasseh only encouraged an already existing
problem. Although Hezekiah instituted reforms, both the common
people, as well as the upper classes, continued to be attracted
to false gods.<p>
<blockquote>
F. Economic Situation
</blockquote>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Isaiah lived during a period of great prosperity, especially at
the beginning of his ministry. However, this prosperity was concentrated
in the upper classes, who had a tendency to be stingy and oppressive
in handling their wealth.
