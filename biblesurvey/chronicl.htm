<B>The Book of 1-2 Chronicles</B> 
<P>
<B>I. Title</B> 
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Hebrew title for the books of 1 and 2 Chronicles (which were
originally one book) is <I>di<U>b</U>ere ha-yamim</I>, &quot;The
Words of the Days&quot;. In the Septuagint, it receives the title
<I>Paraleipomenon</I>, &quot;Of things that have been left untold&quot;;
some copies of the Septuagint add &quot;concerning the kings of
Judah&quot;. Jerome accepted the Greek title, but suggested that
the Hebrew title would be better represented by a derivative from
the Greek word <I>chronos</I>. He thought such a designation would
better fit the character of the book, which he saw as a chronicle
of the whole of sacred history. Jerome's suggestion is followed
in the title give to the book in English.
<P>
<B>II. Authorship and Sources</B> <p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<i>A. Authorship</i>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Talmud (<I>Baba Bathra</I> 15a) attributes Chronicles to Ezra. 
However, the book itself makes no claim of authorship and no firm
conclusions can be drawn as to authorship. The interest taken
by the author or authors in the Levites has lead some to speculate
that perhaps someone from among them is responsible for the book,
but that is not a necessary inference.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The last event alluded to in the book (in 2 Chronicles 36:22-23) is the return from Babylonian exile, which would suggest that the book was
written shortly that time. The genealogy in 1 Chronicles 3:17-24,
which lists the descendants of Jehoiachin (Jeconiah) seems to
cover six generations from the exile, which would take the book
down to about 400 BC, as the earliest date for its completion.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<i>B. History</i>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The story of Chronicles is continued in Ezra-Nehemiah, and in
fact 2 Chronicles 36:22-23 is virtually identical to Ezra 1:1-3a.
As a result, some have speculated that perhaps Ezra 1-6 should
be considered part of the book of Chronicles, rather than part
of Ezra-Nehemiah.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Chronicles has been regarded as a poorer history that Samuel-Kings
because of its concentration on ecclesiastical rather than political
affairs, although such a conclusion says more about the bias of
modern critics than expressing a genuine problem with Chronicles.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Some of the differences between Chronicles and Samuel-Kings does
raise historical problems, most noticeably in the fact that Chronicles
vastly inflates financial and military figures. This might be
the ancient equivalent of adjusting for inflation, though most
likely the differences in numbers are simply the result of textual
corruption.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Other key differences exist between Samuel-Kings and Chronicles;
below are just a few of the more significant:<p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<i>C. Sources for Chronicles</i>
