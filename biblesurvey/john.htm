<B>The Book of John</B> 
<P>
<B>I. Title</B> 
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The title of the book is taken from the name of the traditional
author, the apostle John.
<P>
<B>II. Author and Setting</B><p>
<blockquote>
A. Author and Date
</blockquote>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The most important witness in the early Church to the authorship
of the gospel is Irenaeus, bishop of Lyons in the last quarter
of the second century. That Irenaeus would affirm John's authorship
is significant because he was acquainted with Polycarp, who had
been a companion of John. Other early church fathers who affirmed
John's authorship include Eusebius, Polycrates and Clement of
Alexandria.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Westcott's presentation of the internal evidence relating to the
authorship of the gospel is famous and follows the following five
steps: 1) the author was Jewish, 2) he lived in Palestine, 3)
he was an eyewitness 4) he was an apostle, and finally, 5) he
was the apostle John.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; John 21:24 makes the statement &quot;This is the disciple who
testifies to these things and who wrote them down. We know that
his testimony is true.&quot; Westcott took this verse to be an
addition by the elders of the church in Ephesus, bearing witness
to the authorship and authenticity of this gospel.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The majority opinion among evangelicals, and even among a large
number of non-evangelicals, is that John, the son of Zebedee is
the author of the gospel which bears his name.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As for the date of the book, it is generally suggested by evangelicals
that he wrote it sometime between AD 85 and 90, although dates
as early as 45 and as late as 110 have sometimes been suggested.
Tradition, based upon the statements of Irenaeus and Eusebius,
suggests that the book was written at Ephesus.<p>

B. John's Relationship to the Synoptics
</blockquote>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Although there is much that John's gospel and the other three
have in common, there are some significant differences. Regarding
these differences, Merrill C. Tenney writes:<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On the other hand, John the Baptist's introduction of Jesus to
his disciples is highlighted rather than his general preaching-of-repentance
ministry. Jesus' initial contact with the disciples is quite different
from the calling of the first four disciples as reported elsewhere.
The discourses of Jesus in John are mainly apologetic and theological
rather than ethical and practical, as in the Sermon on the Mount.
Only seven miracles are recounted, and of these only two duplicate
those of the Synoptic Gospels. Chronological order is different,
for John places a cleansing of the temple early in Jesus' ministry,
whereas the Synoptics locate it in Passion Week. The events of
the Last Supper, the betrayal, the hearing before Pilate, and
the Crucifixion are reported quite differently from the other
three Gospels; and the Resurrection account has only slight resemblance
to the others.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; These phenomena have evoked many questions, and various theories
have been advanced to account for them. (Merrill C. Tenney. <I>The
Expositor's Bible Commentary, The Gospel of John</I>. Grand Rapids:
Zondervan, 1981, p. 19)  See <A HREF="matthew.htm">Matthew</A>
for more on the synoptic question.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The seemingly out-of-order quality of the Book of John has been
mentioned and speculated about by many commentators. Some speculate
that the text has suffered some sort of disarrangement over its
history, as if at some point the pages fell out of the book and
someone put them back in, but not in quite the right order. However,
there is no objective evidence to suggest that this has happened,
and it is an unlikely explanation. Others simply discount the
historicity of much of what is recorded in John, and view it as
simply an inaccurate and poorly produced attempt at a life of
Christ, done by someone several years after the time of John.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; However, an understanding of Semitic structuring techniques take
care of the problem; as is clear from a study of the Old Testament,
chronology is not the primary structuring principle in a Semitic
text. Instead, theme takes precedence. Therefore, although John
is written in Greek, it was not written by a Greek. It may be
useful to repeat the discussion of Semitic structuring techniques.

<B>Topical Expansion in Hebrew Poetry and Narrative</B>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Not uncommonly in the Bible, the structure of the text is similar
to that of a newspaper article, where the first line or paragraph
summarizes the rest of the story. Look at the following examples
to get a sense of how this works in the Bible.<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<i>1. Genesis 1:1-3:25</i>
<P>
1:1 In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
<BLOCKQUOTE>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<i>3. Proverbs 1:10-19</i>
<P>
1:10 My son, if sinners entice you
<br>
do not go.<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
1:11-14 How sinners entice.
<br>
1:15-19 Do not go with them.

<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<i>4. Ecclesiastes 2:1-26</i>
<P>
2:1 I spoke in my heart, &quot;Come now, I will test pleasure
<br>
and examine good.&quot;
<br>
Behold: all of it is also meaningless.<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
2:2-10 Testing with pleasure to discover what's good.
<br>
2:11-26 Everything is meaningless.
</BLOCKQUOTE><P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The apparent repetition or backtracking is extremely common and
is a development or aspect of standard parallelism; the book of
Joshua clearly is not in chronological order; a comparison of
Joshua 15:13-19 and Judges 1:1-15 shows that the two events are
the same, yet in actual fact Caleb's conquest occurred some while
after Joshua's death, although in the book of Joshua, it is recorded
several chapters before Joshua's death is recorded. The reason
is obvious: the story of Caleb fit with the context and theme
of Joshua 15 and so it was inserted there, despite the fact that
chronologically it hardly belonged.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The same sort of thematic structuring apparently occurs in the
book of John.  See the article <A HREF="theme.htm">The Thematic Arrangement of Biblical Texts</A>
in <i>Quartz Hill Journal of Theology</i> for more information.
