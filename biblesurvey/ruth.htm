<B>The Book of Ruth</B> 
<P>
<B>I. Title</B> 
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The English title is the same as the title of the book in Hebrew.
<P>
<B>II. Author and Setting</B> 
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The author of the book of Ruth is unknown. From the genealogy
at the end (4:18-22) the book obviously could have been composed
no earlier than the time of David. Two periods have generally
been proposed for the date of Ruth, one, during the post-exilic
period of Ezra and Nehemiah, and the second, during the reign
of either David or Solomon.

Late Date:</blockquote><p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
1. Linguistic clues -- apparent use of Aramaic words and grammar,
pointing to a time when Hebrew was being replaced by Aramaic in
daily life.
<br>
2. Theological -- reminding people of David's foreign ancestry
(Moabite) in the face of anti-foreign sentiment during the post-exilic
period.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><blockquote>
Early Date:</blockquote><p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
1. Linguistic clues -- the supposed Aramaisms can be explained
in other ways, and there is wide ranging evidence of rather archaic
language in the book, in contrast.
<br>
2. The book does not seem to have such a polemical purpose, and
Ruth's Moabite origin is not such an important feature of the
story.
<br>
3. The story of Ruth seems consistent with the sorts of literature
that was being produced during the time of David and Solomon.

<B>Questions on Ruth</B> 
<P><blockquote>
1. What is the purpose or theme of the book of Ruth?
<br>
2. How does Leviticus 19:9-10 explain Ruth 2:2?
<br>
3. Read Deuteronomy 25:5-10, Leviticus 25:25 and 27:9-33, and
Genesis 38; how do those passages help explain what transpires
in the book of Ruth?
<br>
4. Why did Naomi suggest that Ruth go to Boaz after he had been
partying and uncover his feet? Consider Exodus 4:25, Judges 3:24,
1 Samuel 24:3, and Ezekiel 16:25, where the word &quot;feet&quot;
and/or &quot;uncovering the feet&quot; is used.
<br>
5. Deuteronomy 23:2-8 forbids the descendants of Moabites from
entering the assembly of Yahweh down to the tenth generation.
David is a descendant of a Moabite. How could he become king?</blockquote><p>
