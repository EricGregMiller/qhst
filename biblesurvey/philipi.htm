<B>The Book of Philippians</B> 
<P>
<B>I. Title</B> 
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The title of this book is taken from the name of the city to which
it was addressed: Philippi.
<P>
<B>II. Author and Setting</B> 
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The authors of Philippians are Paul and Timothy:<p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To all the saints in Christ Jesus at Philippi, together with the
overseers and deacons:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Philippi was located in Macedonia, about ten miles inland from
the Aegean Sea. It used to be called Krenides, which means &quot;springs&quot;,
but in 356 BC the name was changed by Philip II, king of Macedonia
from 359-336 BC and father of Alexander the Great. Paul had visited
Philippi on his second and third missionary journeys (see Acts
16:11-40, 20:6).
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The letter was probably written sometime between AD 59 and 61,
during Paul's first imprisonment in Rome (Acts 28:11-31).
