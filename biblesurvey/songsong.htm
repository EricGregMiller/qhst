<B>The Book of Song of Songs</B> 
<P>
<B>I. Title</B> 
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The book is called &quot;Song of Songs&quot; in Hebrew and in
most modern English translations (NIV, for instance); in the King
James Version, it received the title &quot;Song of Solomon&quot;.
The Latin Vulgate called it &quot;Canticles&quot;.
<P>
<B>II. Author and Setting</B> 
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Its Solomonic authorship is widely credited, though the occurrence
of some apparent Persian and Greek terms has lead some to postulate
a post- exilic date. However, since the book lays claim to Solomonic
authorship, it is best to assume that is the case. The reference
to Tirzah in Song of Songs 6:4, which was the capital of Jeroboam
I and his successors (1 Kings 14:17), would not have been set
in parallel with Jerusalem by a poet in either Israel or Judah,
after the division of the kingdom. Therefore, the latest possible
date for the book would be the outbreak of war between Jeroboam
and Abijam, c. 915-913 BC (1 Kings 15:7). The reference in 6:8
to sixty queens and eighty concubines contrasts the figures of
1 Kings 11:3, which speaks of Solomon's &quot;seven hundred wives&quot;
and &quot;three hundred concubines.&quot; Therefore, the Song
of Songs was probably composed early in Solomon's reign.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Also in favor of Solomonic authorship, is the use in Song of Songs
of the natural imagery and the use of the names of many plants
and animals, which would be consistent with Solomon's interests
according to 1 Kings 4:32.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Song of Songs, more than any other book, has been kept in
the dark ages in the thoughts of many interpreters, who continue
to insist on the medieval approach of allegorical interpretation
-- even though they would never approach any other book of the
Bible allegorically. The allegorical approach to the Song of Songs
results in teaching that the story is figurative, representing
Yahweh's love for Israel, and by extension, Christ's love for
the church. Those who cling to this approach would argue, that
if a wholly literalistic approach is taken to the poem, it is
impossible to see why the Song of Songs would have been included
as part of Scripture.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Like Esther, the Song of Songs never once mentions God. However,
only if one takes the odd position that sex is an evil thing,
would one find such a book inexplicable. As important as male-female
relationships and romantic love are to human beings, it would
be impossible to imagine that there would not be at least one
book in the Bible devoted to the topic.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Therefore, the outline will follow the historical-grammatical
interpretation of Scripture, and take the Song of Songs at face
value -- as an erotic love poem.
