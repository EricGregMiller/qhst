<br>

<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Philemon was a slave owner who lived in the Lycus Valley of Asia
Minor. The name of his slave was Onesimus. Although others are
listed in the salutation, the letter is primarily for Philemon.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dodd argued that the letter was written from Ephesus about AD
56; others suggest that it was more likely written from Rome,
at about the same time the letter to the Colossians was written
-- about AD 58-62.
