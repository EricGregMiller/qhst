<B>The Book of Numbers</B>
<P>
<B>I. Title </B>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The English title comes from the Greek translation of the Old
testament (the Septuagint). In Hebrew, the book's title is taken
from the first word in the book, <I>bemidbar</I>-- which means
&quot;in the wilderness&quot;.
<P>
<B>II. The Author </B>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Moses is traditionally assumed to be the author of the book of
Numbers. Please see the discussion at the beginning of <A HREF="gen.htm">Genesis</A>
