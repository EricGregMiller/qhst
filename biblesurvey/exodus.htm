<B>The Book of Exodus</B> 
<P>
<B>I. Title</B>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The English title comes from the Greek translation of the Old
Testament (the Septuagint). In Hebrew, the book's title is taken
from the first words in the book, <I>eleh shemot</I> -- which mean &quot;these
are the names&quot;.
<P>
<B>II. Author</B>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Moses is traditionally assumed to be the author of the book of
Exodus. Please see the discussion at the beginning of <A HREF="gen.htm">Genesis</A>
