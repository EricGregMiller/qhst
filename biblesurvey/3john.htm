<B>The Book of 3 John</B> 
<P>
<B>I. Title</B> 
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The title comes from the name of the author; 3 John is the third
of three letters ascribed to the apostle.
<P>
<B>II. Author and Setting</B> 
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The book does not identify its author by name. He is simply called
&quot;the elder&quot;. However, the style and structure of the
letter seem very similar to what was seen in 1 John, and so a
common author may be assumed.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The date of writing is hard to place, though AD 90 seems a good
guess.
