<B>The Book of Zephaniah</B> 
<P>
<B>I. Title</B> 
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The title is the same in Hebrew as it is in the English and Greek
translations. The name Zephaniah could mean &quot;Yahweh hides&quot;,
and may thus reflect the terror in the days of Manasseh, at the
time of Zephaniah's birth. Sabottka, J. M. P. Smith, and J. D.
W. Watts, on the other hand, have pointed out that his name might
also be derived from a combination of <I>Zaphon</I> and <I>Ya</I>
(an abbreviation for Yahweh). Zaphon was an important Canaanite
deity who gave his name to a mountain north of Israel, where the
gods were supposed to live. The combination of <I>Zaphon</I> and
<I>Ya</I> could then be translated as &quot;Zaphon is Yahweh&quot;.
Such a confession would claim that the God which some people call
Zaphon is really Yahweh. <I>Zaphon</I> is also the common Semitic
word for &quot;north&quot; (cf. Gen. 13:14; Ex. 26:20; 40:22;
Jer. 1:14; Is. 14:13, 31; Ezek 8:14; Psa. 48:3; 89:13; Job 26:7).

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The name Zephaniah occurs ten times in the Old Testament and is
spelled in a couple of different ways. Perhaps four different
people are called Zephaniah:<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
1. The prophet whose book bears his name (Zephaniah 1:1)
<br>
2. A priest, the son of Maaseiah (Jeremiah 21:1; 29:25, 29; 37:3;
52:24; 2 Kings 25:18)
<br>
3. A Kohathite, the son of Tahath (1 Chronicles 6:36)
<br>
4. A priest, the father of Josiah (Zechariah 6:10, 14).

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;B. Setting</i>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In light of the words in the superscription (1:1), the reader
might suppose that the date of Zephaniah would not be a problem.
Clearly, Zephaniah prophesied during the reign of Josiah (640-609
BC). However, the question is, exactly when during his reign did
Zephaniah prophesy: before the reforms of 621 BC or after?
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Most scholars prefer a date before Josiah's reform in 621 BC,
because Zephaniah spends the book denouncing such syncretistic
practices as Baal worship and child sacrifice, which had become
more widespread in Israel since Manasseh's reign. By denouncing
such practices, Zephaniah could have been a contributing influence
in bringing about reform. However, some scholars have noted that
the text mentions &quot;the remnant of Baal&quot;, in 1:4, which
suggests that the reforms had already come, but failed, in that
a remnant of Baal worship still persisted.
