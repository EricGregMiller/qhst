<B>The Book of Luke</B> 
<P>
<B>I. Title</B> 
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The book carries the name of its traditional author.
<P>
<B>II. Author and Setting</B> 
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The author is not mentioned by name in the book; it is clear,
from the introduction, that he was not an eyewitness. Rather,
the author indicates that he gained his information from other
sources and did extensive research (1:1- 3).
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The close similarity between the book of Acts and this gospel
indicate a common author, and this commonality is helpful in determining
an author for the book of Luke.<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
1. Both books are dedicated to Theophilus.
<br>
2. Acts refers to a previous document, which is generally assumed
to be the gospel of Luke.
<br>
3. Language and style are similar in the two books.
<br>
4. Passages appear in the book of Acts where first person plural
replaces the normal third person, suggesting that the author was
a companion of Paul (Acts 16:10-17, 20:5-15, 21:1-18, 27:1-28:16).
<br>
5. Luke was a frequent companion of Paul's (Col. 4:14, 2 Tim.
4:11, Philemon 24)
<br>
6. The author of the gospel of Luke and Acts describes illnesses
with greater precision and interest than the other gospel writers.

<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In addition to the internal evidence which seems to suggest Luke,
Paul's doctor friend, is the author of the book bearing his name,
a long line of tradition (reported by Irenaeus, Clement of Alexandria,
Origen and Tertullion) also suggests him as the author.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; See the discussion in the book of <A HREF="matthew.htm">Matthew</A>
for information relating to the Synoptic problem.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Regarding Luke himself, it seems clear that he was a gentile,
rather than Jewish. (Cf. Col. 4:10-14 where he is contrasted with
those &quot;of the circumcision&quot;). This may account for the
statement in 1:3 where he indicates that he intends to give an
&quot;orderly account&quot; of Jesus' life. This would be in contrast
to the tendency by Matthew and Mark (and also John) to allow thematic
elements to dominate over chronological. Being a Greek, Luke would
have found chronology of greatest importance.  See <A HREF="theme.htm">The Thematic Arrangement of Biblical Texts</A>
for more information on this issue.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The place of writing is unknown. An early date, before Paul's
execution is suggested by the way the book of Acts ends suddenly.
It is supposed that it ends where it does because it is at that
time and place that Luke was writing. Since Acts was written after
the gospel, the gospel therefore is quite early, perhaps before
AD 60, and certainly before AD 70.

<B>IV. Questions for Luke</B>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The questions for the book of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John have
been combined into one set of questions located at the end of
the introduction to the book of <A HREF="john.htm">John</A>. The
questions should be answered after reading all four gospels. <p>
