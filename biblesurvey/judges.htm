<B>The Book of Judges</B> 
<P>
<B>I. Title</B> 
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The title, Judges, is the same in both the Hebrew original and
in the Greek translation. It was derived frrom the content of
the book, rather than its author.
<P>
<B>II. Author</B> 
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The author of the book of Judges is unknown. The book covers events
from Joshua's death, around 1380 BC (taking an early date for
the Exodus) until close to the time of Samuel (c. 1075 BC), who
can be pictured as being the last judge before the beginning of
the monarchal period (although Samuel and his time do not form
part of the story of the book of Judges).
