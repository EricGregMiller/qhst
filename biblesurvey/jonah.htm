<B>The Book of Jonah</B> 
<P>
<B>I. Title</B> 
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The title is the same in Hebrew as it is in English and Greek
translations. The name Jonah means &quot;dove&quot; in Hebrew.
<P>
<B>II. Author and Setting</B> 
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Jonah was the son of Amittai, and according to 2 Kings 14:25,
he prophesied during the reign of Jeroboam II. Jonah was raised
in Galilee, in the city of Gath-hepher, which is located just
a few miles north of Nazareth. The book dates to between 775 and
750 BC, and it describes how his special message to Nineveh was
finally delivered.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There is a Jewish tradition that states that Jonah was the son
of the widow of Zarephath, the same child that Elijah raised from
the dead. There is no hard evidence to prove this, however.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Since the days of Omri in 885, the Northern Kingdom had suffered
sporadic attacks by both Assyria and Syria. During the reign of
Jeroboam II, Israel was living in relative peace and prosperity.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Assyria, during Jonah's day, was on the rise as a world power.
Nineveh, its capital, had a population of around 600,000. The
king of Assyria when Jonah showed up with his message of repentance
was either Shalmanezer IV (783-773 BC) or Ashurdan III (773-755
BC).
