<B>The Book of 2 Timothy</B> 
<P>
<B>I. Title</B> 
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The title of the letter comes from the name of the man to whom
it is addressed. It is the second of two letters written to Timothy.
<P>
<B>II. Author and Setting</B> 
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The author of the letter is Paul, according to 2 Timothy 1:1-2a:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, according
to the promise of life that is in Christ Jesus,
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To Timothy, my dear son:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This second letter to Timothy was apparently written while he
was imprisoned in Rome, awaiting execution. Timothy, based on
the information in 1 Timothy 1:3, was still in Ephesus. The letter
was written sometime between AD 62 and 67. If the tradition is
accurate regarding Paul's martyrdom during the reign of Nero,
then the letter was certainly written before June of AD 68, because
it was in that month that the emperor committed suicide.

of a single word in Galatians 3:16-18.
<br>

that are unimportant or inappropriate?</blockquote>
