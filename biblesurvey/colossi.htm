<B>The Book of Colossians</B> 
<P>
<B>I. Title</B> 
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The title is taken from the name of the city that the letter was
addressed to: Colosse.
<P>
<B>II. Author and Setting</B> 
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The authors of the letter are Paul and Timothy, based on 1:1-2a:<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy
our brother,
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To the holy and faithful brothers in Christ at Colosse:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Colosse was a small and rather insignificant town in the Roman
province of Asia, located on the south bank of the Lycus River.
It was about a hundred miles from Ephesus and ten miles from Laodicea.
It is thought that Paul probably evangelized Colosse and Laodicea
during his extended ministry in Ephesus (Acts 19:10); it is not
a certainty, however, since the book of Acts does not even mention
the city of Colosse. All that we really know about Paul's relationship
to the city comes in this letter and the letter to Philemon.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The letter was probably written from Rome, during Paul's first
imprisonment there (see Acts 28:30-31) about AD 62.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The writing of this letter to the Colossian church seems to have
been occasioned by news of a heretical teaching in the church.
From the points that Paul makes in his letter, certain elements
of this heresy can be gleaned:<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
1. It professed to be a philosophy; Paul points out that it is
a &quot;hollow and deceptive&quot; philosophy, in contrast to
a true one (2:8)
<br>
2. It emphasized circumcision, dietary laws, and holy days (2:11,
14, 16, 17)
<br>
3. Affirmed the mediation of various supernatural powers in the
creation of the world and in salvation that should be worshiped
(2:15, 18, 19)
<br>
4. Some of the false teachers were ascetic (2:20-23)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Curtis Vaughan, in addition to the Judaizing elements of this
movement, argues that it apparently included elements that would
later be known as Gnosticism.<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It sought by its oriental myths and Greek philosophy to absorb
the various religions with which it came into contact. It lent
itself to an air of exclusiveness, cultivating an &quot;enlightened&quot;
elite for whom alone salvation was possible. Gnosticism, in all
its forms, was characterized by belief in the evil of matter,
in mediating beings, and in salvation through knowledge. Beginning
with the assumption that all matter is evil, the Gnostics argued
that god and matter were therefore antagonistic. Indeed, they
contended that God didn't create this world and that he has absolutely
no contact with it. However, intellectual necessity did not permit
them to break completely the bond between divinity and the material
world. They therefore taught that God put forth from himself a
series of &quot;aeons&quot; or emanations, each a little more
distant from him and each having a little less of deity. At the
end of this chain of intermediate beings there is an emanation
possessing enough of deity to make a world by removed far enough
from God that his creative activities could not compromise the
perfect purity of God. The world, they argued, was the creation
of this lesser power, who being so far removed from God was both
ignorant of and hostile to him. These &quot;aeons&quot; -- &quot;offshoots
of deity&quot; Martin calls them -- were thought to inhabit the
stars and rule man's destiny. They therefore were to be placated
and worshiped. Paul's references to &quot;thrones...powers...rulers...authorities&quot;
(2:15), and &quot;worship of angels&quot; (2:18) are allusions
to these supposed intermediate beings.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Belief in the inherent evil of matter made it impossible for the
Gnostics to accept the real incarnation of God in Christ. Some
of them explained it away by denying the actual humanity of Jesus,
holding that he only seemed to be human. The body of Jesus, they
taught was an illusion, a phantom, only apparently real. In their
view, Christ was only one of many intermediaries between God and
the world, but he was sufficiently related to God to share his
abhorrence of any direct contact with matter. The advent of Christ
&quot;was a piece of play-acting when God wore a mask of humanity
on the stage of human history, giving the appearance of being
a man but really being still God-in-disguise.&quot; Other Gnostics
explained away the incarnation by denying the real deity of Jesus.
That is, they stopped short of making a complete identification
of the man Jesus with the aeon Christ. Both these tendencies were
perhaps present at Colosse in embryo form and both may be alluded
to in the Epistle -- for example in the affirmation that &quot;in
Christ all the fullness of the Deity lives in bodily form&quot;
(2:9).
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Belief that matter is evil also lead to a distorted view of the
Christian life. Some Gnostics turned to asceticism, others to
libertinism. The ascetics felt that they had to free themselves
from the influence of matter (the body) by inflicting punishment
on their bodies. Those who gave in to license assumed an attitude
of indifference to things physical and material, the idea being
that only the soul is important and therefore the body may do
what it pleases. Indications of both tendencies may be found in
the Colossian letter, the former being opposed in 2:20ff. and
the latter in 3:5ff.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As its name would indicate, Gnosticism -- the word is related
to <I>gnosis</I>, &quot;knowledge&quot; -- taught that salvation
is obtained not through faith but through knowledge. The knowledge
of which the Gnostics spoke, however, was knowledge acquired through
mystical experience, not by intellectual apprehension. It was
an occult knowledge, pervaded by the superstitions of astrology
and magic. Moreover it was an esoteric knowledge, open only to
those who had been initiated into the mysteries of the gnostic
system. (Curtis Vaughan, &quot;Colossians&quot; <I>The Expositor's
Bible Commentary</I>, vol. 11. Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1978,
pp. 166-167)

<B>Questions on Colossians</B> 
<P><blockquote>
1. When was the letter to the Colossians written?
<br>
2. Using Colossians 1:15-20, demonstrate the deity of Jesus. What
other passages of Colossians may be useful for demonstrating this
truth?
<br>
3. What does Paul have to say regarding the nature of our salvation?
Does it depend on human regulations? Why or why not?
<br>
4. Reconcile Colossians 3 with salvation by grace. Does Paul contradict
himself between chapters 2 and 3? Why or why not?
<br>
5. Discuss 3:18-4:1. What does this passage have to say about
Christian relationships?
<br>
6. Compare Colossians 4:7-18 with Philemon. What is the relationship
between the letter to Philemon and the letter to the Colossians?</blockquote>
