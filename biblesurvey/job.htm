<B>The Book of Job</B> 
<P>
<B>I. Wisdom Literature</B><p> 
<blockquote>
A. Introduction
</blockquote>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The book of Proverbs, together with Job and Ecclesiastes fall
under the broad category of wisdom literature, a genre common
in the Ancient Near East; wisdom literature consists of instructions
for successful living or contemplations on the perplexities of
human existence. By its nature, therefore, wisdom literature is
intensely practical. Proverbs, especially, may be considered the
&quot;how to&quot; section of the Bible.<p>
<blockquote>
B. Two Types of Wisdom Literature
</blockquote>
<P>
1. Proverbial Wisdom (Proverbs): short, pithy sayings which state
rules for personal happiness and welfare.
<br>
2. Speculative Wisdom (Job and Ecclesiastes): this type of literature
may be further subdivided into a) monologues, like Ecclesiastes,
and b) dialogues, like Job. These sorts of wisdom books delve
into such problems as the meaning of existence and the relationship
between God and people. Speculative wisdom literature is practical
and empirical, not theoretical in nature. Problems of human existence
are discussed in terms of concrete examples, for instance, &quot;There
was a man...whose name was Job.&quot;<p>
<blockquote>
C. Origin of Wisdom Literature
</blockquote>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The roots of wisdom literature are probably to be found in short
popular sayings which express rules for success or common observations
concerning life. Old Testament examples are found in 1 Kings 20:11,
Jeremiah 23:28 and Jeremiah 31:29, as examples.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The transition from oral to literary wisdom took place in Egypt
about 2500 BC (as in <I>The Instruction of Vizier Ptah-hotep</I>)
and in Sumer shortly afterward.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Throughout the Ancient Near East, a class of scribes or wise men
arose whose highly honored task was to create or collect or polish
wise sayings, usually under the patronage of a royal court or
a temple. The sources of these sayings may have been clan wisdom,
instructions from school, or sayings circulated among the nobility.
Two of Israel's kings are credited with important contributions
in this area: 1) Solomon (1 Kings 4:29-34) and 2) Hezekiah (Proverbs
25:1).
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By the seventh century BC, the wise man (Heb. <I>Hakam</I>) had
assumed sufficient prominence in Judah to be classed with prophet
or priest (Jeremiah 8:8-9; 18:18), although there is still some
question as to whether he was recognized as a professional or
simply as an unusually wise citizen.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As the phenomenon of prophecy faded in the Persian and Greek periods
of Israel's history, the wise man gained in stature, as such important
apocryphal works as <I>The Wisdom of Ben-Sirah</I> (<I>Ecclesiasticus</I>)
and <I>The Wisdom of Solomon</I>, demonstrate.<p>
<blockquote>
D. Literary Devices
</blockquote>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The wise men employed several literary devises as aids to memory:<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
1. Comparisons (Proverbs 17:1)
<br>
2. Numerical sequences (Proverbs 30:15ff)
<br>
3. Alliteration and Acrostic Patterns (Psalm 37, Proverbs 31:10-31)
<br>
4. Riddles (Judges 14:12ff; 1 Kings 10:1)
<br>
5. Fables (Judges 9:7-15; Ezekiel 17:3ff; 19:1ff)
<br>
6. Parables (extension of comparisons: 2 Samuel 12:1-4, Isaiah
28:4)
<br>
7. Allegories (Isaiah 5:1-7)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
<blockquote>
E. Wisdom in the Rest of the Bible
</blockquote>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The sampling above of the literary devices used by the authors
of wisdom literature testifies to the impact they made on the
prophetic writings. H. Gunkel has categorized certain Psalms as
also falling into the genre of wisdom literature:<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Psalm 1, 37, 49, 73, 77, 112, 127, 128, and 133
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Others have noted elements of wisdom literature in the Story of
Joseph (Genesis 37-50), the Succession Narrative (2 Samuel 9-20;
1 Kings 1-2), Daniel, and Esther. In the New Testament, the book
of James is a good example of proverbial wisdom literature.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Wisdom's contributions are most readily discernible when its peculiar
vocabulary, techniques, and didactic content are all present in
the text. Such influences are apparent in the teachings methods
of Jesus -- for instance his use of proverbs and parables.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though wisdom literature was an international phenomenon, as the
Old Testament freely recognizes (Edom in 1 Kings 4:31; Obadiah
8; Jeremiah 49:7; and Egypt in Genesis 41:8; 1 Kings 4:30; Isaiah
19:11-15), Israel's wisdom was different in its stress that true
wisdom comes from God.<p>
<blockquote>
F. Interpretation
</blockquote>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Wisdom literature has consistently been misinterpreted by evangelicals
and non-evangelicals, taking a very consistent pattern, as expressed
well and succinctly by J. Barton Payne in his book, <I>The Theology
of the Older Testament</I> (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1962), pp.
55-56:<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The wisdom books are universalistic in outlook. They appeal to
all (Prov. 1:20) and they cover a bewildering array of subjects.
Their illustrations are frequently drawn from nature, which is
the concern of men everywhere (1 Kings 4:33; Prov. 30:24-28);
and their teachings are generally divorced from Hebrew national
life and ceremony (with but few exceptions, as Prov. 3:9). The
Proverbs are timeless, separated from the limitations of localization.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This just is not the case. The proverbs are not timeless, they
are not separated from the limitations of localization, they are
not universalistic in outlook and they CANNOT be divorced from
Hebrew national life and ceremony. To do so, would be to wrest
the proverbs out of context. The Proverbs, as with ALL Hebrew
scriptures, are founded ultimately on the five books of Moses.
This is made abundantly clear from the consistent use of covenant
language in the book of Proverbs. The promises given in the book
of Proverbs are derived from the promises made by God through
Moses in the Pentateuch. The blessings pronounced upon the righteous
and wise in Proverbs are the blessing promised to the obedient
Israelites in the covenant God made with them. To make these promises
universal is to do a terrible disservice to them, and is to terribly
misunderstand them. To assure Christians today that the promises
God made specifically to the Jews are attainable and guaranteed
is to mislead and misinform people, creating false hope.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Even for the ancient Israelite, the promises in Proverbs did not
necessarily have a quick, easy or immediate fulfillment. The delay
in attaining the promises created a tension is Israelite theology,
forming the basis for a book like Job or Ecclesiastes. The tension
is alleviated by recognizing that God's wisdom and understanding
are not always the same as our own. It is why, in the midst of
Job, in the twenty-eighth chapter, a song to wisdom shows up;
it expresses the fact, so necessary to understand, that wisdom
and understanding come from God alone, and that however hard we
search, unless God grants understanding to us, it remains unattainable.
That too often we fail to understand or recognize the fulfillment
of God's promises should not really surprise us.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The story of Joseph is similar to the story of Job. Again, the
narrative describes a righteous individual, a person in God's
favor, who nevertheless suffers terribly. Anytime he seems to
be achieving some small measure of God's promised blessings, he
is hit with a sudden reverse. But in the end, all his misery was
fulfilling God's ultimate purpose.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sometimes, as with Joseph, the righteous person sees the reason
for the travail of his soul. But other times, his experience will
more parallel the life of Job; the suffering soul will never comprehend
why he received suffering instead of the anticipated blessing
which should be his according to the divine covenant.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; One other item to note about the prosperity and wealth promised
in the proverbs is that such wealth might not refer to material
accumulations, but rather to a wealth of wisdom and a close relationship
with God.
<P>
<B>II. Title</B> 
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The book of Job is named after the principle character in the
book; it is the same in Hebrew as it is in English.
<P>
<B>III. Setting</B> <p>
<blockquote>
A. Author
</blockquote>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The author of the book of Job is unknown. Various individuals
have been proposed, including Job himself, Solomon, and Ezra.
The Talmud ascribed it to Moses; the theory there is that Moses
acquired the poem during the forty years he spent tending sheep,
and that he added the prose prologue and epilogue; alternatively,
it is proposed that he merely learned of Job while he was in Midian,
and wrote the entire book himself.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some commentators have proposed that Elihu is the author, based
on Job 32:16-17, but frankly that seems an awful stretch.<p>
<blockquote>
B. Date
</blockquote>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Traditionally, Job has been dated to the time of the patriarchs.
The reasons for this position are as follows:<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
1. Job's sacrifices were according to the patriarchal pattern,
with Job acting as the priest for his household.
<br>
2. Job lived to be nearly two hundred years old (cf. Abraham,
who lived to be one hundred seventy-five).
<br>
3. There is no reference to Israel or the miracles accompanying
the exodus.
<br>
4. There is no reference to the Law of Moses.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Against this traditional argument, there is strong reason to suspect
that Job actually lived sometime after the exodus, and after the
people of Israel had entered the promised land.
<P><blockquote>
1. The word <I>Rahab</I> occurs twice in the book of Job:<p>
<blockquote>
If he snatches away, who can stop him?
<br>
Who can say to him, &quot;What are you doing?&quot;
<br>
God does not restrain his anger;
<br>
even the cohorts of Rahab cowered at his feet. (Job 9:12-13)
<P>
By his power he churned up the sea;
<br>
by his wisdom he cut Rahab to pieces.
<br>
By his breath the skies became fair;
<br>
his hand pierced the gliding serpent. (Job 26:12-13)
</blockquote>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Those two passages in Job can be profitably compared with some
other biblical passages:<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
to Egypt, whose help is utterly useless.
<br>
Therefore I call her Rahab the Do-Nothing. (Isaiah 30:7)
<P>
I will record Rahab and Babylon
<br>
among those who acknowledge me --
<br>
Philistia too, and Tyre, along with Cush --
<br>
and will say, &quot;This one was born in Zion.&quot; (Psalm 87:4)
<p>
You rule over the surging sea;
<br>
when its waves mount up, you still them.
<br>
You crushed Rahab like one of the slain;
<br>
with your strong arm you scattered your enemies. (Psalm 89:9-10)
<P>
Awake, awake! Clothe yourself with strength,
<br>
O arm of the Lord;
<br>
awake, as in days gone by,
<br>
as in generations of old.
<br>
Was it not you who cut Rahab to pieces,
<br>
who pierced that monster through?
<br>
was it not you who dried up the sea,
<br>
the waters of the great deep,
<br>
who made a road in the depths of the sea
<br>
so that the redeemed might cross over? (Isaiah 51:9-10)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From these references, it seems clear that the word <I>Rahab</I>
is a reference to Egypt; furthermore, it appears that it is used
in Job to refer to the Israelites exodus from Egypt. Therefore,
the book of Job had to have been written sometime after that event.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Psalm 87 was written by the sons of Korah, dating the Psalm to
the time of David or Solomon, according to 1 Chronicles 6:22,
31-46. Psalm 89 was written by Ethen the Ezrahite, who lived close
to the time of Solomon, too, since Solomon is favorably compared
to him in 1 Kings 4:31. Isaiah lived many years after Solomon.
Therefore, an educated date for the time of authorship of the
book of Job would seem to place it sometime between the time of
David and Isaiah.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But what about the time frame of Job himself? Since the words
about Egypt and the exodus are put in his mouth, a time during
the patriarchs is completely ruled out. However, if we compare
Job's behavior, in serving as priest to his house, with the time
of the Judges, we find definite parallels, because then, too,
sacrifice was not exclusively the work of priests in a central
tabernacle or temple (see for instance Judges 2:5, 6:25- 27, 11:31,
and 13:19-21; see also 1 Samuel 6:14 and 11:15).</blockquote><p>
<blockquote>
C. Background
</blockquote>
<P><blockquote>
1. Job is unique, but not isolated.
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Job was not written in a vacuum; it is part of the genre called
wisdom literature, and Israel's neighbors produced a good number
of stories that fit into the same category. Several works from
the Ancient Near East have been compared to the book of Job by
scholars:
<P><blockquote>
a. Keret
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; An Ugaritic story tells about a good king; despite his piety,
he is bereaved of all his family, but his fortunes turn around
after he offers ritual prayers.
<P>
b. Ludlul bel Nemeqi
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The story of Ludlul bel Nemeqi has been called &quot;the Babylonian
Job.&quot; However, the work is actually a hymn of thanksgiving
to Marduk for recovery from illness. The worshiper reviews his
ordeal of horrible and unaccountable disease. While there are
passages in Job in which Job describes his symptoms with equally
gruesome detail, a piece such as the Babylonian composition properly
should be placed in the context of what Job might have done after
his recovery. Therefore, while a story of suffering lies behind
the Mesopotamian poem, it is only a monologue and lacks the elaborate
dramatic form of Job. Furthermore, Babylonian polytheism could
never approach the questions raised by Job.
<P>
c. A Sumerian Poem
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; An edifying tract intended to encourage a person in affliction
to keep on glorifying his personal god (a minor deity), and by
bitter wailing, whose volume should be increased by the assistance
of his friends and the hiring of professionals, to move the god
to pity -- or irritate him with the noise. While the Sumerian
poem shares with Job a tragic sense of the burden of sin, the
justice of the gods is never questioned or even expected. All
a person can do is simply weep and hope for the best.
<P>
d. Dispute over suicide
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This Egyptian work is the debate of a despondent man with his
own soul. He maintains that self-destruction is the best solution
to the problems of life. (Cf. Job 3)
<P>
e. A Pessimistic dialogue between a master and his servant
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The problem confronted in this Babylonian story is simple boredom,
not suffering. The effete and languid master knows nothing of
Job's agony. There is no real debate, since the slave merely echoes
his master's sentiments.</blockquote>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In order for another work to be called a &quot;Job&quot;, that
work should resemble the biblical book in plot, form, and content.
A passing similarity here and there is not enough. To call every
story of human suffering a &quot;Job&quot; creates a false impression
and obscures the uniqueness of the Israelite composition. Suffering
is universal, and the discussion of the reasons for it is sure
to arise in any reflective culture. The human response ranges
from vehement protest through agonized perplexity to placid resignation.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The literature of the Ancient Near East has not yielded another
Job. There is a considerable list of writings from this region,
and a few from further afield, which remind one of Job in this
way or that. But none comes close to Job when each work is examined
as a whole. Each shows more differences than similarities, and
not one can be considered seriously as a possible source or model
for Job.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The primary difference between Job and the other writings, as
is the case between the Bible and anything else to which it might
be compared in its environment, is the simple fact that Job is
written from a monotheistic standpoint. All the other cultures
of the Ancient Near East were polytheistic.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That polytheism is the primary reason that a book like Job would
never have appeared among them. The question of suffering is not
a problem unless one has only one, all powerful and all good God.
If there are many gods, then the troubles of life can be explained
as the conflict between opposing deities who usually were not
all powerful and certainly were not all good. Humanity has simply
the misfortune of standing between them.</blockquote><p>
<blockquote>
D. The Question of Job
</blockquote>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Most commentaries will discuss Job in terms of the question of
&quot;why do the righteous suffer.&quot; Unfortunately, this is
not the question of the book of Job. The real question comes in
Job 1:9-11:<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Does Job fear God for nothing?&quot; Satan replied. &quot;Have
you not put a hedge around him and his household and everything
he has? You have blessed the work of his hands, so that his flocks
and herds are spread throughout the land. But stretch out your
hand and strike everything he has, and he will surely curse you
to your face.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The question which Job faced, and which we all must face, is a
profound one: &quot;Why do we serve God?&quot; Is it for the good
stuff we get from him, or out of fear of getting bad stuff? Or,
do we do it simply because we love him?
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That is the real question!
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Job wanted to know why he was suffering, and his faith was wavering
as a consequence of his pain. God's response was not to inform
him of the wager he'd made with the Devil. Instead, God responds
by listing various things that Job does not understand. The implication
here, is thus: &quot;Look at all the things you don't understand
-- for instance the water cycle and the life cycles of various
animals. Your lack of understanding in these areas does not in
the least challenge your faith. So why, when you suffer and don't
understand why, do you feel your faith any more challenged?&quot;
