<B>The Book of Esther</B> 
<P>
<B>I. Title</B> 
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The book is named after the principle character in the story;
Haddassah was her Hebrew name. She was also know as Esther, the
Hebraised form of the name &quot;Ishtar&quot;, the pagan goddess
of fertility, sexual love, and war.
<P>
<B>II. Author and Setting</B> 
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The author of the book of Esther is unknown. The story is set
during the time of Xerxes, the king of Persia from 486 to 464
BC. Esther begins in the third year of Xerxes rule (Esther 1:3).
Obviously the story was written some time after the events that
are described, but how long after is unclear.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Later, Xerxes lead his army into battle against Greece, after
three years of planning, intending to punish them for the way
they had humiliated his father Darius I when the Athenians defeated
him at the battle of Marathon (490 BC). Xerxes accompanied his
forces on their march through Thrace, Thessaly, and Locris, only
to witness his own defeat; although at first successful at the
battle of Thermopylae, his hopes were dashed at Salamis (480)
and Plataea (479). Defeated, he returned to Asia in 480 BC and
stayed there for the rest of his life. Chapters two through the
end of the book may take place after this defeat, while the banquet
of chapter one may have taken place just before Xerxes lead his
army off to defeat. He was ultimately murdered in 465 by Artabanus.
Xerxes' son, Artaxerxes succeeded him to the throne.
