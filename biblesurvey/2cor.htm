<B>The Book of 2 Corinthians</B> 
<P>
<B>I. Title</B> 
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The book receives its title from the name of the church to which
it is addressed. It is the second letter written to the church
in Corinth.

<B>II. Author and Setting</B> <p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This letter was written by Paul and Timothy, based on 2 Corinthians
1:1:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy
our brother,
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To the church of God in Corinth, together with all the saints
throughout Achaia:
</BLOCKQUOTE><p>
<blockquote><i>
B. Setting and Date
</i></blockquote>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The letter to the Corinthian church was probably written AD 55
or 56. For further information on the city of Corinth, see the
discussion on <A HREF="1cor.htm">1 Corinthians</A>.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Murray J. Harris (<I>The Expositor's Bible Commentary</I>, Vol.
10, Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1976, p. 307) has proposed the following
chronology for the events surrounding the writing of 1 and 2 Corinthians,
during Paul's time in Ephesus (Acts 19-20):
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Spring AD 55 1 Corinthians written
<br>
Summer/Fall AD 55 Painful visit (2 Cor. 2:1, 12:14, 21, 13:1-2)
<br>
Spring 56 Severe letter (2 Cor. 7:8, 12)
<br>
Spring 56 Paul leaves Ephesus
<br>
Summer 56 Paul in Macedonia
<br>
Summer 56 Titus arrives in Macedonia
<br>
Fall 56 2 Corinthians written
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His proposal, therefore, is that 2 Corinthians was written from
Macedonia. This is suggested by references in 2 Corinthians 7:5,
8:1, 9:2-4.

<B>IV. Questions on 2 Corinthians</B> 
<P>
<blockquote>1. When was the second letter to the Corinthians written?
<br>
2. What lead to Paul boasting and of what did he boast? How did
he feel about such boasting?
<br>
3. What does Paul's life indicate about knowing and doing the
will of God? Is God's will easy and pleasant? Do things going
well or badly have anything to do with indicating whether you
are doing God's will?
<br>
4. What does Paul have to say about forgiveness and restoration?
<br>
5. What was Paul's &quot;thorn in the flesh&quot;?
<br>
6. What does Paul have to say about Satan? How does this relate
to false teachers? </blockquote>
