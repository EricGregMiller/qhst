<B>The Book of 1 Thessalonians</B> 
<P>
<B>I. Title</B> 
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The title of the letter comes from the name of the city to which
it was written: Thessalonica. It is the first of two letters written
to the church in that city.
<P>
<B>II. Author and Setting</B> 
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The authors of the first letter to the church in Thessalonica
were Paul, Silas, and Timothy, according to 1 Thessalonians 1:1:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Paul, Silas and Timothy,
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord
Jesus Christ:
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Grace and peace to you.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Based on the mention of Silas and Timothy in the opening to the
letter, the letter was obviously written after the first missionary
journey, and after Acts 16:1, when Timothy joined Paul. Likewise,
the letter was obviously written after Paul's first visit to Thessalonica
as described in Acts 17:1-9.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Written about AD 50, it is probably the earliest Pauline letter.
Thessalonica was a free city ruled by its own council of citizens.
Since 146 BC it had been the seat of Roman government for all
of Macedonia.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;How long had Paul stayed in Thessalonica when he founded the church
there? Robert L. Thomas writes:<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For three consecutive Sabbaths Paul spoke in the synagogue, but
met with the usual Jewish resistance. Luke's description of the
events may be interpreted as meaning that the resistance forced
him to leave the city immediately. On the other hand, we may understand
that he continued to work in the city for some time after it was
terminated in the synagogue.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Three points make the latter alternative more probable: (1) Paul
engaged in gainful employment at Thessalonica (1 Thess 2:9; 2
Thess 3:8). Tow to three weeks are not sufficient time for settling
into a trade and freeing converts from the burden of supporting
their missionaries. Besides, Paul used his working as proof of
his self-sacrifice for them, something he could hardly have done
during a limited stay. (2) Upon his departure from Thessalonica,
he left a thriving church -- not one still in the throes of separation
from the local synagogue. Indeed, by the time he left, this church
included many Gentiles fresh from their heathen idolatry (1 Thess
1:9). They could not have been won through a synagogue ministry.
(3)Before leaving, Paul had received at least two special gifts
from Philippi a hundred miles or five days away. It is difficult
to crowd all this into two or three weeks. (Robert L. Thomas.
