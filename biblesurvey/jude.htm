<B>The Book of Jude</B> 
<P>
<B>I. Title</B> 
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The title comes from the name of the author. Jude is the early
English equivalent of Judah; the spelling Jude dates from a time
when the final &quot;e&quot; in English was pronounced, the same
as it is today in German. Jude, Judah, and Judas are all variations
of the same name (<I>Ioudas</I> -- Greek; <I>Yehudah</I> -- Hebrew).
<P>
<B>II. Author and Setting</B> 
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The author of the letter is Jude, based on 1:1:<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ and a brother of James,
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To those who have been called, who are loved by God the Father
and kept by Jesus Christ:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Jude claims to be the brother of James (1:1), which presents the
best clue for identifying who this Jude might be. After James
the son of Zebedee was martyred by Herod Agrippa I (c. AD 44 --
cf. Acts 12:2), the only James well enough known in the early
church would be James of Jerusalem, whom Paul identified as &quot;the
Lord's brother&quot; (Galatians 1:19).
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Therefore, Jude is apparently also a half-brother of Jesus, otherwise
unmentioned in the New Testament.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Based on 2 Peter's apparent dependence upon Jude, a date of composition
between AD 60 and 65 seems reasonable.
