<B>The Book of Hosea</B> 
<P>
<B>I. Title</B> 
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The title is the same in both Hebrew and in Greek and English
translations. Hosea is a variant form of the name &quot;Joshua&quot;;
&quot;Jesus&quot; is the Anglicized Greek form of the same name,
which means &quot;salvation.&quot;

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Very little is known about Hosea, since he is never mentioned
outside this book that bears his name.<p>

B. Setting
</blockquote>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The prophesies of Hosea cover a time period from about 753 BC
to 715 BC, during the reigns of Jeroboam II and Uzziah, through
that of Hezekiah. Jereboam II died about 753 and Hezekiah began
his reign about 715.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The golden age of prosperity for Israel was ending with Jeroboam
II. Following his death would come years of chaos, ending finally
with the destruction of the nation in 722 BC. A total of six kings
reigned in the Northern Kingdom of Israel between Jeroboam II
and the end; most of the reigns were cut short by assassination.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;During this period of political unrest, the Northern Kingdom was
in a bad way both spiritually and morally. Although they continued
to worship Yahweh, they mixed the worship of other gods with it,
and performed child sacrifice and involved themselves in sacred
prostitution.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hosea's prophesies were directed to the people of the Northern
Kingdom of Israel.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Prophets contemporary with Hosea were Amos and perhaps Jonah,
in Israel; in Judah, Micah and Isaiah were prophesying.
