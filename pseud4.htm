<b>WISDOM LITERATURES</b>
<P>
 The Pseudepigraphal wisdom literature has its roots in the Biblical
tradition.  For that reason a brief review of Biblical Wisdom
is necessary.
<P>
 The Wisdom material of the Bible is both provocative and inspiring.
 I include the books of  Daniel, Ruth, and Esther in this category
as well.  Why?  Because Ruth is about a wise woman who unites
herself to the Jews; Esther is about a wise Jew who protects her
fellow Jews, and Daniel is a wise man who knows how to act in
a foreign court.  Job, Proverbs and Ecclesiastes are wisdom literature
because they speak about how one should live in the world.  And
of course the very excellent book of Ben Sira is perhaps the pinnacle
of wisdom literature.
<P>
 Thus, the one thing that makes a work a wisdom work is that it
describes how one who is wise should (and does) behave in the
world.  Wisdom literature arose out of the need to train young
Israelites for government service.  If one keeps this in mind
one is well on the way to correctly interpreting wisdom texts.
<P>
 Wisdom is common in the Ancient Near East.  There are numerous
examples of wisdom in ancient documents from all of the societies
around Israel.  For this reason it is proper to say that Israel
is like its neighbors in its desire to train people for right
living.  The Sumerians, Babylonians, and Assyrians as well as
the Egyptians all have collections of wisdom literature.  All
the peoples of the Ancient Near East strove to be wise.  In all
of this literature the Fear of God is shown to be the beginning
of wisdom.  That is, reverence for God helps people put their
priorities in order.  When a person's life is in order, then God
is the center of that life.
<P>
 On the flip side of the expectations of good which come from
wise living, Wisdom sometimes applied still does not yield the
expected results.  Two of the most famous examples of this are
Job and Ecclesiastes.  When one reads Job one reads the story
of a man who did all the right things, but who nonetheless suffered.
 And the Preacher is a book describing the ultimate despair and
futility of life.  Yet the wise person is much better able to
cope with the ups and downs of life than the fool.  And why? 
Because the wise person places his life in God's hands while the
fool takes the reigns into his own hands.  In summary one can
and should say that wisdom literature has as its goal the training
of people in correct behavio   r in a world that is n
<P>
 What is true of the biblical wisdom tradition is also true of
the extra-biblical, pseudepigraphal material.
