&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The government of Quartz Hill Community Church is vested in the
body of believers who compose it. It is subject to no other ecclesiastical
body, but it recognizes and sustains obligations of mutual counsel
and cooperation which are common among New Testament churches
of like faith and order. Quartz Hill Community Church is a cooperating
member of the Southern Baptist Convention and the High Desert
Baptist Association.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Quartz Hill Community Church desires to be a dynamic spiritual
organism empowered by the Holy Spirit to share Christ with as
many people as possible in our church, community, and throughout
the world; it seeks to be a worshipping fellowship, experiencing
an awareness of God, recognizing his person, and responding in
obedience to his leadership; it wants to experience an increasingly
meaningful fellowship with God and fellow believers; it wants
to help people experience a growing knowledge of God and humanity;
it wants to be a church that ministers unselfishly to persons
in the community and world in Jesus' name; and it wants to be
a church whose purpose is to be Christlike in its daily living,
emphasizing total commitment of life, personality, and possessions
to the lordship of Christ.
