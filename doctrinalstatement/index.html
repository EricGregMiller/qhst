<font size=1>The doctrinal statement of Quartz Hill School of Theology is based
on the <b>Baptist Faith and Message</b> adopted by the Southern
Baptist Convention on May 9, 1963. It is to be understood as descriptive, rather than prescriptive, since God's revelation of Himself is alone authoritative for faith and practice.

<B>The Bible</B>
<hr noshade color="#663300">		

The Bible was written by men divinely inspired and is the record
of God's revelation of Himself to humanity. It is a perfect treasure
of divine instruction. It has God for its author, salvation for
its end, and truth, without any mixture of error for its matter.
It reveals the principles by which God judges us; and therefore
is, and will remain to the end of the world, the true center of
Christian union, and the supreme standard by which all human conduct,
creeds, and religious opinions should be tried. The criterion
by which the Bible is to be interpreted is Jesus Christ.

There is one and only one living and true God. He is an intelligent,
spiritual, and personal Being, the Creator, Redeemer, Preserver,
and Ruler of the universe. God is infinite in holiness and all
other perfections. To Him we owe the highest love, reverence,
and obedience. The eternal God reveals Himself to us as Father,
Son, and Holy Spirit, with distinct personal attributes, but without
division of nature, essence, or being.
<P>

<B>A. God the Father: </B>God as Father reigns with providential care over His universe,
His creatures, and the flow of the stream of human history according
to the purposes of His grace. He is all powerful, all loving,
and all wise. God is Father in truth to those who become children
of God through faith in Jesus Christ. He is fatherly in His attitude
toward all people.

Christ He was conceived of the Holy Spirit and born of the virgin
Mary. Jesus perfectly revealed and did the will of God, taking
upon Himself the demands and necessities of human nature and identifying
Himself completely with mankind yet without sin. He honored the
divine law by His personal obedience, and in His death on the
cross He made provision for the redemption of men from sin. he
was raised from the dead with a glorified body and appeared to
His disciples as the person who was with them before His crucifixion.
He ascended into heaven and is now exalted at the right hand of
God where He is the One Mediator, partaking of the nature of God
and of man, and in whose Person is effected the reconciliation
between God and man. He will return in power and glory to judge
the world and to consummate His redemptive mission. He now dwells
in all believers as the living and ever present Lord.

men of old to write the Scriptures. Through illumination the Spirit
enables men to understand truth. The Spirit exalts Christ. The
Spirit convicts of sin, of righteousness and of judgment. The
Spirit calls men to the Savior, and effects regeneration. The
Spirit cultivates Christian character, comforts believers, and
bestows the spiritual gifts by which they serve God through His
church. The Spirit seals the believer unto the day of final redemption.
The Spirit's presence in the Christian is the assurance of God
to bring the believer into the fullness of the stature of Christ.
The Spirit enlightens and empowers the believer and the church
in worship, evangelism, and service.

<B>Humanity</B>
<hr noshade color="#663300">
Humanity was created by the special act of God, in His own image,
and is the crowning work of His creation. In the beginning the
human race was innocent of sin and was endowed by Their Creator
with freedom of choice. By his free choice Adam sinned against
God and brought sin into the human race. Through the temptation
of Satan the human race transgressed the command of God, and fell
from their original innocence; whereby their posterity inherit
a nature and an environment inclined toward sin, and as soon as
they are capable of moral action become transgressors and are
under condemnation. Only the grace of God can bring human beings
into His holy fellowship and enable human beings to fulfill the
creative purpose of God. The sacredness of human personality is
evident in that God created human beings in His own image, and
in that Christ died for humanity; therefore, every human being
possesses dignity and is worthy of respect and Christian love.

<B>Salvation </B>
<hr noshade color="#663300">

Salvation involves the redemption of the whole human being, and
is offered freely to all who accept Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior,
who by His own blood obtained eternal redemption for the believer.
In its broadest sense salvation includes regeneration, sanctification,
and glorification.
<P>
<B>A. Regeneration,</B> or the new birth, is a work of God's grace
whereby believers become new creatures in Christ Jesus. It is
a change of heart wrought by the Holy Spirit through conviction
of sin, to which the sinner responds in repentance toward God
and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. Repentance and faith are inseparable
experiences of grace. Repentance is a genuine turning from sin
toward God. Faith is the acceptance of Jesus Christ and commitment
of the entire personality to Him as Lord and Savior. Justification
is God's gracious and full acquittal upon principles of His righteousness
of all sinners who repent and believe in Christ. Justification
brings the believer into a relationship of peace and favor with
God.

<P>

<B>B. Sanctification</B> is the experience, beginning in regeneration,
by which the believer is set apart to God's purposes, and is enabled
to progress toward moral and spiritual perfection through the
presence and power of the Holy Spirit dwelling in him. Growth
in grace should continue throughout the regenerate person's life.

<P>
<B>C. Glorification</B> is the culmination of salvation and is the
final blessed and abiding state of the redeemed.

<B>God's Purpose of Grace</B>

Election is the gracious purpose of God, according to which He
regenerates, sanctifies, and glorifies sinners. It is consistent
with the free agency of human beings, and comprehends all the
means in connection with the end. It is a glorious display of
God's sovereign goodness, and is infinitely wise, holy, and unchangeable.
It excludes boasting and promotes humility.
<P>
All true believers endure to the end. Those whom God has accepted
in Christ, and sanctified by His Spirit, will never fall away
from the state of grace, but shall persevere to the end. Believers
may fall into sin through neglect and temptation, whereby they
grieve the Spirit, impair their graces and comforts, bring reproach
on the cause of Christ, and temporal judgments on themselves,
yet they shall be kept by the power of God through faith unto
salvation.

A New Testament church of the Lord Jesus Christ is a local body
of baptized believers who are associated by covenant in the faith
and fellowship of the gospel, observing the two ordinances of
Christ, committed to His teachings, exercising the gifts, rights,
and privileges invested in them by His Word, and seeking to extend
the gospel to the ends of the earth.
<P>
The church is an autonomous body, operating through democratic
processes under the Lordship of Jesus Christ. In such a congregation
members are equally responsible. Its Scriptural officers are pastors
and deacons.

The New Testament speaks also of the church as the body of Christ
which includes all of the redeemed of all the ages.

In Christian education there should be a proper balance between
academic freedom and academic responsibility. Freedom in any orderly
relationship of human life is always limited and never absolute.
The freedom of a teacher in a Christian school, college, or seminary

to the Scriptures, Christians should contribute of their means
cheerfully, regularly, systematically, proportionately, and liberally
for the advancement of the Redeemer's cause on earth.

Christ's people should, as occasion requires, organize such associations
and conventions as may best secure cooperation for the great objects
of the Kingdom of God. Such organizations have no authority over
one another or over churches. They are voluntary and advisory
bodies designed to elicit, combine, and direct the energies of
our people in the most effective manner. Members of New Testament
churches should cooperate with one another in carrying forward
the missionary, educational, and benevolent ministries for the
extension of Christ's Kingdom. Christian unity in the New Testament
sense is spiritual harmony and voluntary cooperation for common
ends by various groups of Christ's people. Cooperation is desirable
between the various Christian denominations, when the end to be
attained is itself justified, and when such cooperation involves
no violation of conscience or compromise of loyalty to Christ
and His Word as revealed in the New Testament.

<B>The Christian and the Social Order </B>
<hr noshade color="#663300">



Every Christian is under obligation to seek to make the will of
Christ supreme in his own life and in human society. Means and
methods used for the improvement of society and the establishment
of righteousness among human beings can be truly and permanently
helpful only when they are rooted in the regeneration of the individual
by the saving grace of God in Christ Jesus. The Christian should
oppose, in the spirit of Christ, every form of greed, selfishness,
and vice. He should work to provide for the orphaned, the needy,
the aged, the helpless, and the sick. Every Christian should seek
to bring industry, government and society as a whole under the
sway of the principles of righteousness, truth, and brotherly
love. In order to promote these ends Christians should be ready
to work with all people of good will in any good cause, always
being careful to act in the spirit of love without compromising
their loyalty to Christ and His truth.

It is the duty of Christians to seek peace with all people on
principles of righteousness. In accordance with the spirit and
teachings of Christ they should do all in their power to put an
end to war.
<P>
The true remedy for the war spirit is the gospel of our Lord.
The supreme need of the world is the acceptance of His teachings
in all the affairs of human beings and nations, and the practical
application of His law of love.

<B>Religious Liberty</B>
<hr noshade color="#663300">


God alone is Lord of the conscience, and He has left it free from
the doctrines and commandments of people which are contrary to
his Word or not contained in it. Church and state should be separate.
The state owes to every church protection and full freedom in
the pursuit of its spiritual ends. In providing for such freedom
no ecclesiastical group or denomination should be favored by the
state more than others. Civil government being ordained of God,
it is the duty of Christians to render loyal obedience thereto
in all things not contrary to the revealed will of God. The church
should not resort to the civil power to carry on its work. The
gospel of Christ contemplates spiritual means alone for the pursuit
of its ends. The state has no right to impose penalties for religious
opinions of any kind. The state has no right to impose taxes for
the support of any form of religion. A free church in a free state
is the Christian ideal, and this implies the right of free and
unhindered access to God on the part of all people, and the right
to form and propagate opinions in the sphere of religion without
interference by the civil power.
