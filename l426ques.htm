Please answer the following in the form of a
ten page essay; use the assigned text and any other resources
to help you, and then submit your essay to the Quartz Hill School
of Theology for evaluation and grading.  <HR>

<P>
1)   Take your Hebrew Text and using Genesis 1
as the basis, examine it in conjunction with the Septuagint and
the Latin Vulgate, and make your own judgments concerning what
the original text would have been; write out this text in an English
translation.  By doing this the student will have a slight taste
of what textual critics must do (but on a MUCH larger scale).
