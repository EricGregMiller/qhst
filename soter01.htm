<B>Soteriology: Doctrine of Salvation</B> 
<P>
Christianity and Judaism are historical religions. The gospel
is the proclamation about events that happened in a specific geographic
area, during a definite, specified period of time. The confessions
of Israel's faith consisted primarily of rehearsing the historical
actions of God. G.E. Ladd writes:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The uniqueness and scandal of the Christian religion rests in
the mediation of revelation through historical events. The Hebrew-Christian
faith stands apart from the religions of its environment because
it is an historical faith, whereas they were religions rooted
in mythology or the cycle of nature. The God of Israel was the
God of history, or the <I>geschichtsgott</I>, as German theologians
so vividly put it. The Hebrew-Christian faith did not grow out
of lofty philosophical speculation or profound mystical experiences.
It arose out of the historical experiences of Israel, old and
new, in which God made Himself known. This fact imparts to the
Christian faith a specific content and objectivity which set it
apart from others....
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The Bible is not primarily a collection of the religious ideas
of a series of great thinkers. It is not first of all a system
of theological concepts, much less of philosophical speculations....
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The recital of God's historical acts is the substance of Christian
proclamation. (G.E. Ladd.  <I>The Knowledge of God: The Saving
Acts of God</I>. Grand Rapids: Baker, 1962, pp. 7-13)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
If the essence of the Judeo-Christian message consisted of philosophical
ideas about God, timeless truths, ethical ideals, or profound
religious insights, then the historical framework could be discarded
without affecting Christian beliefs (for instance, notice the
work of Barth and Bultmann in this direction). However, the Bible
instead describes God's intervention in the lives of people during
certain periods in this planet's history. What James says about
faith applies to the way God has worked with the human race:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
What good is it, my brothers, if a man claims to have faith but
has no deeds? Can such faith save him? Suppose a brother or sister
is without clothes and daily food. If one of you says to him,
&quot;Go, I wish you well; keep warm and well fed,&quot; but does
nothing about his physical needs, what good is it? In the same
way, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
But someone will say, &quot;You have faith; I have deeds.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith
by what I do. (James 2:14-18)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
In other religions it may all be subjective warm fuzzies. Christianity,
in contrast, is dependent on the acts of God. Christians do not
have a God who is merely transcendent; he is also immanent. The
Old Testament presents an active God, demonstrating by his deeds
that he is truly a God of love, and expecting his creatures to
respond in kind. God is not a hypocrite. What he says is backed
up and illustrated by his works. He expects no less for his creation.
Again, James writes:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is
this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to
keep oneself from being polluted by the world. (James 1:27)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Because God is active, rather than passive, and reveals himself
in deeds, it is important that a study of salvation should begin
with the Old Testament. We can see God's salvation worked out
by deeds. Greg Cantelmo writes (I am indebted to Mr. Cantelmo
for much of the material in this chapter):
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Throughout the history of the church there has been a tendency
to cut the New Testament loose from the Old Testament in one way
or another and thus to dehistoricize the gospel. Most studies
of the doctrine of salvation begin with the New Testament and
therefore do the same. When the historical element is pushed aside,
the New Testament message is seriously distorted. It becomes so
individualized, internalized, spiritualized, and rationalized
that it loses contact with the earth.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
...To ignore the history of the Old Testament and develop a New
Testament theology isolated from its historical background distorts
the Christian message. This is why classic systematic theologies
are inadequate. They subordinate revelation in acts to revelation
in propositions. They tend to abstract theology from its historical
setting and place it in a rationalistic framework. (Greg Cantelmo,
<I>Doctrine of Salvation.</I>  Panorama City: Grace Community
Church, n.d.)

<B>The Exodus</B> 
<P>
<I>1. Introduction:</I> 
<P>
An examination of Israel's worship shows that its Sabbaths, ceremonies,
harvest festivals, and institutions were devoted to commemorating
and rehearsing the redemption of the nation in the Exodus, since
their national existence was dependent on that event. Even more
than Americans look back to the revolution and celebrate it, the
Israelites looked back to the Exodus. It was the clearest indication
they had of God's love for them. As a concrete reality in history,
it stood - and stands - as everlasting proof of God's ability
to save. Many of the psalms express worship of God simply by relating
his actions during the Exodus:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Your ways, O God, are holy.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
What god is so great as our God?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
You are the God who performs miracles;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
with your mighty arm you redeemed your people,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
the descendants of Jacob and Joseph.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The waters saw you, O God,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
the waters saw you and writhed;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
the very clouds poured down water,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
the skies resounded with thunder;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
your arrows flashed back and forth.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Your thunder was heard in the whirlwind,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
your lightening lit up the world;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
the earth trembled and quaked.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Your path led through the sea,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
your way through the mighty waters,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
though your footprints were not seen.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
You led your people like a flock
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
by the hand of Moses and Aaron. (Psalm 77:13-20)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Systematic theologies customarily describe God by his attributes.
God is said to be omniscient, omnipotent, and omnipresent; he
is loving, he is merciful; he is good, he is truth - on and on
it goes. While this somewhat philosophical way of putting matters
might be helpful, it easily becomes abstract, with the resulting
tendency to picture God as a series of files or boxes, each labeled
separately. While the Bible identifies all these roles, it presents
Yahweh as a whole person - not as pieces - involved in specific
activities.
<P>
If you were to write a biography of a man, you would not have
a section labeled &quot;attributes&quot; when you detailed elements
of what made that individual what he was. A biography would tell
of the actions of that man over the course of his life. If the
man were brave, he would be shown to be brave by his deeds, not
by a lone sentence telling the reader &quot;he is brave&quot;.
<P>
If you were to describe the things that made a man special in
a eulogy or a testimonial, you would describe his character by
relating incidents in his life. You wouldn't call this a list
of that man's attributes. In describing his character one ordinarily
wouldn't simply say, &quot;he is loving, good, merciful, and generous&quot;;
rather, one would likely describe those incidents which elucidate
those characteristics of the man. Likewise, it is very unnatural,
and (dare I say it) even unscriptural, to portray God's attributes
by way of a sterile list. The writers of the Bible, in speaking
of God, and in praising him, describe his <I>acts</I> - acts which
are loving, merciful, etc. It is no wonder that systematic theologies
usually have as much life about them as a three thousand year
old Egyptian mummy.
<P>
To see how the Bible describes God as a complete person, take
a look at Exodus 15:1-18, the Song of Moses, as an example (I
am indebted to Greg Cantelmo for this illustration). There, Yahweh
is described as:

<P>
The whole Song of Moses can be said to illustrate these different
attributes. Don't think of the attributes as abstracts, or unmixables.
The attributes describe how God behaves, and they are thoroughly
mixed together in this song.
<P>
If you asked an ancient Israelite, &quot;Who is Yahweh?&quot;,
part of his answer might have been, &quot;the one who saves.&quot;
<P>
The concept of salvation as developed in the pivotal Exodus texts
and throughout the Bible, includes two kinds of divine activity:
deliverance and blessing. Both of these are the result of a covenant,
which as we have learned, grows from love (see Chapters Four through
Six). For instance, look back at the Song of Moses: Exodus 15:1-12
shows the deliverance, while Exodus 15:13-18 shows the blessing.
Salvation is a way that God shows his love. Ancient Israel knew
what it meant to be delivered out of an evil situation, for in
its history it experienced deliverance often. But Israel also
enjoyed the blessings of God. Its state of well-being was the
result of its reconciliation with God.
<P>
<I>2. Salvation As Deliverance In History: </I>
<P>
Deliverance from Egyptian servitude was a great experience, though
not without moments of panic. Israel was in trouble as the Egyptians
were chasing them.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
As Pharaoh approached, the Israelites looked up, and there were
the Egyptians, marching after them. They were terrified and cried
out to Yahweh. They said to Moses, &quot;Was it because there
were no graves in Egypt that you brought us to the desert to die?
What have you done to us by bringing us out of Egypt? Didn't we
say to you in Egypt, 'Leave us alone; let us serve the Egyptians?'
It would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to
die in the desert!&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Moses answered the people, &quot;Do not be afraid. Stand firm
and you will see the deliverance Yahweh will bring you today.
The Egyptians you see today you will never see again. Yahweh will
fight for you; you need only be still.&quot; (Exodus 14:10-14)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The first deliverance, as recorded in the rest of chapter fourteen,
was a decisive military victory by Yahweh against the Egyptians.
Israel went from being the vassal of the Egyptians to being the
vassal of Yahweh.
<P>
<I>3. Salvation As Blessing Through Sacrifice: </I>
<P>
The deliverance from Egyptian bondage was an external deliverance,
a rescue from a visible foe. Another sphere in which Israel learned
the basic elements of salvation was sacrifice. It was in the sacrifice
that recognition was given to her internal deliverance. More significantly,
in sacrifice she experienced salvation as the blessing of forgiveness.
This blessing goes beyond just sacrifice; it extends to all the
acts ritually performed in a worship setting. This embraces public
prayer, sacrifice, song, and also ritual structures such as tabernacles
and even officiating persons.
<P>
In Egypt, as a final plague, the angel of death was about to strike,
removing the firstborn from every household. Provision to escape
death was given in the Passover sacrifice. The Passover was joy
to those who observed the divinely given prescription, but disaster
to those who disregarded it. Deliverance from the plague in which
the eldest was taken came through the sacrifice of a lamb, essentially
a blood sacrifice, known as the Passover. God spared or delivered
the people.
<P>
The same root word <I>nasal</I> used of the Passover in Exodus
12:27 is used in the deliverance from the Sea of Reeds recorded
in Exodus 6:6.
<P>
In subsequent history the institution of sacrifice was spelled
out in great detail. What did it all mean? What is the power of
the sacrifice? What kind of blessing did it signify? Is there
a theology of sacrifice?
<P>
<B>Sacrifice</B> 
<P>
<I>A. The Attitude</I> 
<P>
Sacrifice is a concept of great importance in the Old Testament,
and ultimately in the New Testament as well. In contrast to sacrifice
in the rest of the Ancient Near East, the sacrifices commanded
of the Israelites were not ends unto themselves. The sacrifice
for the Israelites was not designed to simply placate the gods.
A correct mental attitude, and active righteousness were prerequisites
for acceptable sacrifice in ancient Israel. See, for example,
Genesis 4:3-7:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
In the course of time Cain brought some of the fruits of the soil
as an offering to Yahweh, while Abel brought fat portions from
some of the firstborn of his flock. Yahweh looked with favor on
Abel and his offering, but on Cain and his offering he did not
look with favor. So Cain was very angry, and his face was downcast.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Then Yahweh said to Cain, &quot;Why are you angry? Why is your
face downcast? If you do what is right, will you not be exalted?
But if you do not do what is right, sin is a beast at your door;
he desires to have you, but you must master him.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Cain's offering was rejected because he was not doing right. The
idea of sacrifice as an expression of love for God and neighbor
- an inner attitude of true righteousness as a habit of life -
is a common theme throughout the Old Testament. In this light,
look at Isaiah 1:10-20:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Hear the word of Yahweh, you rulers of Sodom;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
listen to the law of our God, you people of Gomorrah!
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;The multitude of your sacrifices -
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
what are they to me?&quot; asks Yahweh.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;I have more than enough of burnt offerings,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
of rams and the fat of fattened animals;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I have no pleasure in the blood of bulls and lambs and goats.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
When you come to meet with me,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
who has asked this of you,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
this trampling of my courts?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Stop bringing meaningless offerings!
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Your incense is detestable to me.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
New Moons, Sabbaths and convocations -
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I cannot bear your evil assemblies.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Your New Moon festivals and your appointed feasts my soul hates.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
They have become a burden to me;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I am weary of bearing them.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
When you spread out your hands in prayer,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I will hide my eyes from you;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
even if you offer many prayers,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I will not listen.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Your hands are full of blood;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
wash and make yourselves clean.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Take your evil deeds out of my sight!
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Stop doing wrong,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
learn to do right!
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Seek justice,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
encourage the oppressed.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Defend the cause of the fatherless,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
plead the case of the widow.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Come now, let us reason together,&quot; says Yahweh.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;Though your sins are like scarlet,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
they shall be as white as snow;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
though they are red as crimson,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
they shall be like wool.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
If you are willing and obedient,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
you will eat the best from the land;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
but if you resist and rebel,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
you will be devoured by the sword.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
For the mouth of Yahweh has spoken.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
True worship is not just outward ritual; for the Israelites, it
became something far more, and therefore far different from that
of their pagan neighbors. For the Christian today, worship and
true religion means more than singing hymns and attending church.
True religion involves love of God and neighbors. Look at James
1:27 again:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is
this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to
keep oneself from being polluted by the world.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<I>B. The Types of Sacrifice </I>
<P>
<I>1. GIFT OFFERING [Heb. minhah]</I> 
<P>
Generally the gift offering is a grain offering. The grain might
be raw, roasted, ground to flour, or prepared as bread or cakes.
See Leviticus 2:1-16 and 6:14-23.
<P>
<I>2. BURNT OFFERING [Heb. olah]</I> 
<P>
The whole burnt offering is entirely consumed in the flames upon
the altar. All of the animal or bird was laid on the altar, except
the hide and those parts which could not be washed clean. The
sacrifice had to be a male, without blemish (Lev. 1:3, 10; 22:18-19).
It could be a sheep, goat, turtle dove, or young pigeon (Lev.
1:14. The birds were usually offered by the poor. See Lev. 5:7;
12:8; 14:22; 15:14-15, 29-30; and Num. 6:10-11).
<P>
<I>3. SIN OFFERING [Heb. hattat] </I>
<P>
The sin offering for the common man was similar to those just
described. In the case of a community leader or an ordinary layman,
the officiating priest did not enter the Holy Place but put blood
on the horns of the altar and poured the remainder of the blood
on the base (Lev. 4:27-35). This offering was for someone who
sinned &quot;unintentionally in doing any of the things which
Yahweh has commanded not to be done, and becomes guilty&quot;
(Lev. 4:27). By means of the sin offering such a person was forgiven
and therefore received blessing. See Leviticus 6:24-30.
<P>
<I>4. GUILT OFFERING [Heb. asham]</I> 
<P>
See Leviticus 5:15-6:7. The guilt offering seems to have been
confined to offenses against God or man that could be estimated
and so covered by compensation. The ordinary guilt offering was
a ram, together with restitution and a penalty of one- fifth its
value (Lev. 5:1-6:7).
<P>
The distinction between the guilt and sin offering is most likely
that sins requiring the sin offering were sins unknowingly committed,
through oversight or negligence. The guilt offering, on the other
hand, was designed for offenses where damage had been done anda loss incurred. Perhaps the guilt offering could more accurately
be called the compensation offering.
<P>
More important than distinguishing the two kinds of sacrifices
is understanding their intention. Scripture stresses that by these
sacrifices, the worshiper was forgiven his or her sin (cf. Lev.
4:26 and 6:7).
<P>
How are the passages in Leviticus to be reconciled with what the
author of Hebrews wrote in Hebrews 10:1-4?
<P>
The law is only a shadow of the good things that are coming -
not the realities themselves. For this reason it can never, by
the same sacrifices repeated endlessly year after year, make perfect
those who draw near to worship. If it could, would they not have
stopped being offered? For the worshipers would have been cleansed
once for all, and would no longer have felt guilty for their sins.
But those sacrifices are an annual reminder of sins because it
is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.
<P>
Again, Isaiah 1 is the key. The New and Old Testament both make
clear that the sacrificial system served as a symbol, an outward
expression, of what had occurred in the mind of the individual
sinner. The outward actions alone, without the inward change,
were valueless - as was precisely the case in Isaiah's day.
<P>
<I>5. SACRIFICE [Heb. zebah] </I>
<P>
Four offerings are specifically labeled &quot;sacrifice&quot;
in the Old Testament:
<P>
a. Covenant sacrifice (Gen. 31:54 and Psa. 50:5)
<P>
b. Passover sacrifice (Exodus 12:1-30; 34:25)
<P>
c. Annual sacrifice (1 Sam. 1:21; 2:19)
<P>
d. Fellowship (or peace) offering (Lev. 7:11-27)
<P>
<I>C. The Significance of Blood in the Sacrifices</I> 
<P>
The sacrifices, whether designed for the collective sins of the
people and offered once a year, or whether prescribed primarily
for the individual and offered as necessary, were usually blood
sacrifices: that is, they necessitated the ritualistic slaughter
of an animal. Other animal sacrifices, such as the burnt offering
and the peace offering, because they involved slaughter, also
involved blood. However, in the sin and guilt offerings particularly,
blood has a special role. Unlike the burnt and peace offerings,
the blood of the sin/guilt offering was a crucial element, at
least according to the traditional interpretation of the rite.
However, it must be noted in Leviticus 5:11 that:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If, however, he cannot afford two doves or two young pigeons,
he is to bring as an offering for his sin a tenth of an ephah
of fine flour for a sin offering. He must not put oil or incense
on it, because it is a sin offering.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
This reminds us again that it is the inner attitude of the sacrificer
which is important, not the offering itself. Even so, the importance
of blood cannot be overlooked. Leviticus 17:11- 14:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
For the life of a creature is in the blood, and I have given it
to you to make atonement for yourselves on the altar; it is the
blood that makes atonement for one's life. Therefore I say to
the Israelites, &quot;None of you may eat blood, nor may any alien
living among you eat blood. Any Israelite or any alien living
among you who hunts any animal or bird that may be eaten must
drain out the blood and cover it with earth, because the life
of every creature is its blood. That is why I have said to the
Israelites, you must not eat the blood of any creature, because
the life of every creature is its blood; anyone who eats it must
be cut off.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
It was not the random shedding of blood, but blood applied to
the altar that was efficacious for the removal of sin, because
the altar, like the mercy seat, was symbolic of deity.
<P>
How was forgiveness understood? If atonement was made, what exactly
was accomplished? The Hebrew root word means either &quot;to cover&quot;
or &quot;to wipe clean&quot;, with the former being by far the
most common understanding. For instance, even in modern Hebrew,
a form of the root has come to have the meaning &quot;hat&quot;.
<P>
<I>D. An Explanation of Sacrifice</I> 
<P>
As Greg Cantelmo pointed out, there is no systematic explanation
given in the Old Testament for the ritual of sacrifice. To arrive
at a systematization, one must operate inductively, following
the scientific method.
<P>
Israelite sacrifice is not a matter of serving God or procuring
benefits. A more biblical understanding of sacrifice is that by
sacrifice communion with the deity is established. The burnt offering
represented thanksgiving and was received by God as a sweet savor.
Because the priest (as God's representative) and the one who offered
the sacrifice, ate the meal together, often in the company of
his or her friends, the fellowship offering especially signified
communion and fellowship with the deity. The worshipers shared
in a feast with Yahweh. But while the above were offerings in
the context of harmonious relationships with Yahweh, provisions
were also made for contact with the deity when, through human
failure, these relationships were broken. Such provisions are
the sin and guilt offerings already discussed. According to Cantelmo,
a theology of sacrifice can be summarized this way:
<P>
1) The sacrifices were intended to restore the harmonious relationship
of the wrong-doer with God.
<P>
2) The sacrifices, as shown by the stress on blood, revolved around
the idea of life. This is why grain could be used as a substitute
for blood, since grain also represents life and blessing. 3) God's
forgiveness was not extended because of the sacrifice itself,
but because of what was behind the sacrifice: the changed life
and true repentance (often with restitution).
<P>
<I>4. Reflections on Salvation </I>
<P>
According to Cantelmo, two forms of divine salvation are revealed
in the Old Testament:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
1) Deliverance from external bondage by Egypt.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
2) Deliverance from internal bondage by sin. What do these models
of redemption signify for the Christian today?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The Exodus has become a central part of what is popularly called
&quot;liberation theology&quot;. It has been widely accepted in
much of the Third World, and there serves to justify wars of liberation
- whether wars against colonial masters, or revolutions against
oppressive dictators. It is a self-serving interpretation of what
God did for Israel against Egypt, and strikes me as being somewhat
presumptuous. There is no reason for thinking that what God did
for Israel will necessarily apply to modern violence against oppression.
In fact, the ideas of liberation theology seem to run counter
to New Testament teaching, especially the Sermon on the Mount,
not to mention the teachings of Christ, Paul and Peter regarding
the proper role of the believer toward the state (even as oppressive
a state as ancient Imperial Rome).
<P>
Regarding salvation in the Old Testament, and the question of
whether it was the same for the people of earlier ages as it is
for us, Cantelmo had some pointed questions that might help clarify
the situation:
<P>
&quot;What do we need to be saved?&quot; Whatever we need, the
people in previous ages needed it too. The oneness of the fallen
condition of the human race guarantees the oneness of salvation
in all ages.
<P>
&quot;Who is the author of salvation?&quot; God alone. Consider
Genesis 6:8, Jonah 2:9 and John 3:16. God is the author of salvation
regardless of the period under consideration. Some have suggested
that the people of the Old Testament were saved by their legal
obedience of the law. If that were the case, then they would have
been the authors of their own salvation. No, if a sinner was saved
in Old Testament times, then it was by the gracious work of God,
not by his or her own acts of righteousness.
<P>
Paul demonstrates that justification through faith was experienced
by Old Testament saints, and he even points to its teaching by
such Old Testament prophets as Habakkuk. In Romans 4:1-5 Paul
argues that Abraham was justified through faith, not because of
the works he did. In Romans 4:6-8, he illustrates that David was
likewise justified through faith alone. Greg Cantelmo writes:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
By quoting from the Law (4:1-5), the Writings (4:6-8), and the
prophets (1:17), Paul demonstrates that the entire Old Testament
from beginning to end taught the same gospel he preached, i.e.
salvation comes by justification through faith alone. In case
these passages were not enough, Paul even quotes Moses in Romans
10:5-9 as preaching the Gospel. And he gives the gospel call to
come to Christ by quoting Joel 2:23 in Romans 10:13....
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We would further point out that a close study of the book of Galatians
will reveal the same teaching of the Apostle Paul: Abraham was
saved through believing the Gospel. Old Testament saints were
justified by faith apart from the works of the law (Gal. 2:16;
3:6-14). Also in Hebrews 11 we are told that the Old Testament
saints lived and died through faith. Look at the story of Moses
in Hebrews 11:24-29. Do you notice anything interesting about
verse 26? (Cantelmo, p. 32)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The interesting thing about verse 26 is the mention there that
Moses, in some way, was conscious of Christ. This demonstrates
that the object of faith has always been the same: the Lord Jesus
Christ. How clearly the people of the Old Testament understood
Christ is open to question, since from a reading of the Old Testament
it is obvious that they had very limited knowledge.
<P>
As a result, some have taught that faith in the Old Testament
had God the Father as its object, while faith in the New Testament
has God the Son as its object. Unfortunately, such thinking fails
to recognize exactly which member of the Godhead the people of
the Old Testament usually interacted with.
<P>
As most Christians realize, Jesus existed from all eternity before
his incarnation (John 1:1-18). Notice too, that all theophanies
in the Old Testament <I>must</I> be pre-incarnate appearances
of the Son of God. John 1:18 records:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
No one has ever seen God, but God the only Son, who is at the
Father's side, has made him known.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The Father has never been seen by human beings. Therefore, God
sightings in the Old Testament are clearly appearances of the
Son of God, rather than the Father. Therefore, the Old Testament
people had as the object of their faith, the pre-incarnate Christ.
<P>
Cantelmo writes that it is sometimes taught that the Old Testament
people were saved by looking forward to the coming of Christ as
we today are saved by looking backward to the work of Christ.
This is very common terminology, but not at all scriptural.
<P>
Saving faith has as its object the <I>person</I> of Christ, who
accomplished the redemption. Faith does not have as its object
the <I>work</I> of Christ. We are rather told to &quot;believe
on the Lord Jesus Christ&quot; (Acts 16:31). We are saved not
by looking back to the work of Christ, but by looking up, believing,
and calling upon His name for salvation (Romans 10:13). Saving
faith is a personal and immediate coming of Christ (Matthew 11:28).
People in the Old Testament were saved, not by looking forward,
but by looking up, to the person of the Son of God. Salvation
was procured by the death of Christ on the cross for everyone
who believes, past, present, and future. Christ's death is why
salvation is possible. We obtain that salvation by the grace of
God, through faith in the person of Christ. Consider the following
passages:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Turn to me and be saved, all you ends of the Earth; for I am God,
and there is no other (Isaiah 45:22)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Seek Yahweh while he may be found;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
call on him while he is near.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Let the wicked forsake his way
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
and the evil man his thoughts.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Let him turn to Yahweh,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
and he will have mercy on him,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
and to our God,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
for he will freely pardon. (Isaiah 55:6-7)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Trust in Yahweh with all your mind
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
and lean not on your own understanding;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
in all your ways acknowledge him,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
and he will make your paths upright. (Proverbs 3:5-6 my translation)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
One thing to keep in mind about salvation in the Old Testament:
the method was the same for the people living before Christ as
it is for those living today: it is by the grace of God, through
faith. The perfunctory acts of the law and the performance of
sacrifice never brought salvation. Rather, keeping the law became
the outward expression of the salvation which had occurred (see
Deut. 6:4-6). The New Testament expresses this concept clearly,
as in 1 John 5:2-3:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This is how we know that we love the children of God: by loving
God and carrying out his commands. This is love for God: to obey
his commands....
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Why do we serve God? Why don't we rob banks? Why don't we kill
people who irritate us? Why don't we have sex with every beautiful
man or woman we meet? Why are we such fine, upstanding people?
Why is it that we don't lie and cheat? Usually we are &quot;righteous&quot;
simply because we don't want to get in trouble. We are worried
about our reputation or we worry that &quot;God will get us.&quot;
But if those are our reasons for righteous behavior, then we are
no different than the people Isaiah condemned in Isaiah 1:10-20,
nor are we any better than the first century Pharisees that Jesus
and Paul fought against.
<P>
So why should we serve God? Matthew 22:34-39 is the key, of course:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Hearing that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, the Pharisees got
together. One of them, an expert in the law, tested him with this
question: &quot;Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in
the Law?&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Jesus replied: &quot;'Love the Lord your God with all your heart
and with all your soul and with all your mind.' This is the first
and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: 'Love your
neighbor as yourself.' All the Law and Prophets hang on these
two commandments.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
One should serve God for the same reason that a man brings flowers
to his wife: love. That alone should be the motivation behind
all our actions.
<P>
<B>Question: Is There an Age of Accountability?</B> 
<P>
The next subject is something of an excursus, but still related
to the main topic of salvation. A popular doctrine in evangelical
Christian circles is the belief that all children below a certain
age, usually called &quot;the age of accountability&quot; - that
is, the age at which time they can make decisions of right and
wrong - are automatically guaranteed heaven because of God's grace.
This doctrine has served well to comfort bereaved parents who
have lost a baby either through miscarriage before birth, or through
accident or disease following birth. There is but one passage,
an Old Testament passage, which is used in support of this teaching:
2 Samuel 12:23.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
But now that he is dead, why should I fast? Can I bring him back
again? I will go to him, but he will not return to me.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The traditional doctrine of the &quot;age of accountability&quot;
suffers from several major problems.
<P>
<I>1. Imputed sin</I> 
<P>
The first problem to be faced by the doctrine of the &quot;age
of accountability&quot; is the issue of human depravity. Human
beings are sinful and guilty before God, not just because of their
own personal sin, but because of what is technically called &quot;imputed
sin&quot;. To impute something means to give to someone something
that may or may not be theirs. Christ's righteousness is &quot;imputed&quot;
to us by grace. It is unearned. We are simply declared righteous
in him. In the same way, sin comes to us. Look at what Paul wrote
in Romans 5:12-14:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and
death through sin, and in this way death came to all men, because
all sinned - for before the law was given, sin was in the world,
but sin is not taken into account when there is no law. Nevertheless,
death reigned from the time of Adam to the time of Moses, even
over those who did no sin by breaking a command as did Adam, who
was a pattern of the one to come.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Look at 1 Corinthians 15:22:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
For as in Adam all die, so in Christ will all be made alive,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
From the moment of conception, human beings are sinners. Notice
Psalm 51:5:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Surely I have been a sinner from birth,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
sinful from the time my mother conceived me.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Or consider, please, Job 25:4:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
How can a man be righteous before God?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
How can one born of woman be pure?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
It must be concluded that even the unborn are sinful in God's
sight.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<I>2. Method of Salvation</I> 
<P>
A second problem that faces the &quot;age of accountability&quot;
is consistency with the way salvation is obtained. Look at the
following passages:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name
under heaven given to men by which we must be saved (Acts 4:12).
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Jesus answered, &quot;I am the way and the truth and the life.
No one comes to the Father except through me.&quot; (John 14:6)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
For it is by grace you have been saved, though faith - and this
not from yourselves, it is the gift of God - not by works, so
that no one can boast (Ephesians 2:8-9).
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son,
that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal
life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the
world, but to save the world through him. Whoever believes in
him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned
already because he has not believed in the name of God's one and
only Son (John 3:16-18).
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
How is it that a fetus or baby is going to &quot;believe&quot;
or &quot;have faith&quot;? The method of obtaining salvation hardly
seems consistent with the idea of an &quot;age of accountability&quot;.
<P>
<I>3. Eternal Security </I>
<P>
The final problem faced by the doctrine of the &quot;age of accountability&quot;
is in reconciling the impossibility of losing one's salvation
with the idea that, until a certain age, all children are under
the grace of God and will be saved if they die. But, once they
commit the unpardonable sin of reaching the age of say, six, their
salvation simply vanishes? How can this possibly be reconciled
with John 10:28-29?
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one
can snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them
to me, is greater than all; no one can snatch them out of my Father's
hand.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
If someone has been saved, they have eternal life and can never
perish. How can that truth be made to fit with the traditional
doctrine of &quot;the age of accountability&quot;?
<P>
<I>4. Conclusion</I> 
<P>
And 2 Samuel 12:23? The popular interpretation of the verse is
that David is thinking in terms of the after life: the child is
in heaven, and some day I will be there also. However, does such
an interpretation make sense in the light of the three objections
raised above? An alternate interpretation might make better sense
of the text in 2 Samuel, both in dealing with the objections,
and in fitting ancient Israelite thought. All David was saying,
was &quot;the baby has died, and someday, I will too.&quot; &quot;Dust
you are, and to dust you will return.&quot; I believe that the
doctrine of the age of accountability is inconsistent with what
the Bible has to say about the human condition, and with what
it says about the method of receiving salvation. In the final
analysis, I believe the traditional doctrine is little more than
wishful thinking - whistling in the dark - with no scriptural
support.
<P>
Still, it must be acknowledged that the question of what happens
to babies who die is not an issue that the Bible addresses specifically.
A lack of dogmatism on the issue is probably the most practical,
particularly since it is an area beyond human control anyway.
