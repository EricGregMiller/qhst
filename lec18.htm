<h1><B>Israel and the Arameans</B></h1>
<P>
 Solomon's elaborate building operations and the lavish scale
of his personal life led to forced labor, burdensome taxation,
and other oppressive measures that produced increasing unrest
among his subjects.  His religious apostasy in the latter part
of his reign further sowed the sees of internal rebellion.  Of
special significance among the foreign enemies, which were divinely
raised up to chasten Solomon, is mentioned &quot;Rezon, the son
of Eliada&quot; (1 Kings 11:23).  This ambitious military leader,
who as a young officer in the army of Zobah, had escaped when
Hadadezer's kingdom had fallen to David, had subsequently established
himself in the important city of Damascus, and as the founder
of an important Aramean kingdom, which was later to prove an inveterate
enemy of the Northern Kingdom of Israel for more than a century
and a half, was a troublesome enemy of Solomon in the latter years
of the United Kingdom (1 Kings 11:23-25).
<P>
 The rapid growth of this powerful hostile kingdom on the northern
borders of Israel, which at times threatened to extinguish its
national life, was made possible largely by the breakup of the
United Monarchy under Solomon's son and successor, the hapless
Rehoboam.  The less than bright choice of this young king in failing
to heed the demands of the people to reduce the heavy burdons
Solomon had imposed led to the disruption of the kingdom at Shechem,
where all Israel had assembled to confirm Rehoboam in the succession
(1 Kings 12:1-19).  This tragedy brought in its wake nearly two
hundred years of trouble.
<P>
<B>Israel Under Jeroboam I</B>
<P>
 The man who was destined to be the first ruler of the Northern
(breakaway) Kingdom initially appears in the biblical account
as an Ephraimite chief in charge of Solomon's conscripted labor
gangs working on the Millo section of the wall at Jerusalem. 
Being a man of courage, he opposed Solomon's tyranny and was compelled
to seek asylum in Egypt (1 Kings 11:26-40).  After hearing of
Solomon's death, he returned to his native soil, apparently prepared
to support Solomon's son, Rehoboam, on his ascension to the throne
(1 Kings 12:4).  But Rehoboam's stupidity alienated the northern
tribes from the house of David, which in turn chose Jeroboam as
their new king.
<P>
<B>Jeroboam's Apostasies.</B>  In order to bolster his political
position, the new king immediately took steps to lead his subjects
away from the faith and worship of their fathers.  He feared that
pious Israelites, who were accustomed to making pilgrimages to
the temple in Jerusalem, would turn to the Southern Kingdom of
Judah not only in religious matters, but ultimately in political
affairs as well (1 Kings 12:27).  He therefore built two shrines
to Yahweh -- one at Bethel in the southern part of his kingdom,
a bare dozen miles north of Jerusalem, and famous as a place of
worship since patricarchal times, when Abraham had built an altar
there (Gen. 12:8), and another in the far north at Dan, likewise
an ancient cultic center (Judges 18:30).  By erecting a sanctuary
at Dan, he attempted &quot;to develop friendlier relations with
the tribes farther to the north who always had held themselves
more or less aloof.&quot;
<P>
 To make the worship more attractive in the sanctuaries he built
at Bethel and Dan, since those temples were not nearly so spectacular
as that at Jerusalem, Jeroboam introduced an innovation: he &quot;made
two calves of gold; and he said unto them, it is too much for
you to go up to Jerusalem: behold your God, O Israel, which brought
you up out of the land of Egypt.  And he set the one in Bethel
and the other he put in Dan.&quot; (1 Kings 12:28-29)
<P>
 Although it has commonly been assumed that the &quot;golden calves&quot;
were direct representations of Yahweh as bull god, it is scarcely
conceivable that Jeroboam would have resorted to such a crude
and violent departure from Yahwism, especially when his design
was to consolodate his newly gained and somewhat precarious authority.
 Besides, such a gross conception is otherwise unparalleled in
Biblical tradition, and is opposed to archeological evidence.
 Among Israel's immediate neighbors -- Canaanites, Arameans, and
hittites -- deities were &quot;nearly always represented as standing
on the back of an animal or as on a throne borne by animals --
but never as themselves in animal form.&quot;  For example, the
storm god of Mesopotamia is picutred on seal-cylinders of the
second millenium BC in the form of a bolt of lightening set upright
on the back of a bull.
<P>
 Although conceptually there is little difference between representing
the invisible Deity as entroned on the cherubim (1 Sam. 4:4; 2
Kings 19:15) or as standing on a bull, except that the former
represent beings of the supernatural realm which uard the holiness
(Gen. 3:24) and the throne of God (Ezek. 1:5; Rev. 4:6-9), nevertheless
Jeroboam's innovation was extremely dangerous.  The bull affiliations
of Baal, lord of heaven, were too closely connected with the more
degrading aspects of pagan cults to be safe, and there is every
indication that the Northern Kingdom fell a prey to idolatrous
pollution as a consequence.  Time and again the Old Testament
writers denounce Jeroboam as the one &quot;who made Israel sin&quot;.
 Morevover, the &quot;calves associated with Yahweistic worship
at Bethel and Dan are repeatedly mentioned as abominations,&quot;
and Jeroboam is referred to in connection with other apostasies
(1 Kings 12:31-33).  The subsequent spirtual declension in the
Northern Kingdom with the introduction of fertility-cult groves
(2 Kings 13:6), high places for the prostitution rites associated
with Canaanite agricultural gods (1 Kings 12:31), and every type
of idolatry, testify to the baneful effects of Jeroboam's apostasy
(2 Kings 17:7-18).
<P>
<B>War and Invasion Under Jeroboam.</B>  The serious weakening
of the Israelite tribes by their division into two kingdoms was
further exacerbated by the wars between them which began under
Jeroboam and Rehoboam and continued intermittently under successive
rulers.  Specific and repeated notice is given to the fact that
&quot;there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually&quot;
(1 Kings 14:30; 15:6).  This sad state of affairs exposed both
kingdoms to the danger of common external foes.  While Aramean
power in Syria was steadily increasing during this period, it
was not yet strong enough to take advantage of Israel's weakness.
 however, Sheshonq I of egypt (Shishak), (c. 935-914 BC) founder
of the Twenty-second Dynasty, was able to avail himself of the
unsettled conditions in Palestine to launch a full scale invasion
in the fifth year of Rehoboam and to seize Solomon's golden shields
and other temple and royal treasures (1 Kings 14:25-28).
<P>
 The Egyptian records do not give the date of Shishak's expedition
and with the uncertain chronology of the early kings of the Davidic
line, scholars are not agreed on the precise date.  Albright placed
the accession of Rehoboam about 922 BC and accordingly his fifth
regnal year would be about 917 BC.  Other scholars vary within
a decade or so.
<P>
 The gold-masked body of Shishak was discovered in his intact
burial chamber at Tanis in 1938-39.  His triumphal inscription
at Karnak (ancient Thebes) gives a long list of his conquests,
which include towns in all parts of Judah and extend up the coastal
plain, across the plain of Esdraelon into Gilead, &quot;showing
that he invaded the Northern Kingdom as well, in spite of his
revious friendship for Jeroboam (1 Kings 11:40).&quot;  A part
of Shishak's stela has been excavated at Megiddo, proving that
he actually did take and occupy this important city, as recounted
in the Karnak inscription.
<P>
<B>Israel and the Rise of Aramean Power</B>
<P>
 The disruption of the Israelite Monarchy at the death of Solomon
and the subsequent wars between the two divided kingdoms not only
permitted Shishak to plunder Palestine, but also furnished the
Arameans of Damascus with an unparalleled opportunity to consolidate
their power and to make their kingdom the dominant Syrian state.
 The kingdoms of Israel and Judah, on the other hand, were so
involved in mutual hostilities that they had little time to devote
to the formidable threat of an unfriendly and increasingly powerful
state forming so dangerously near at hand.
<P>
<B>The Early Kings of Damascus.</B>  The succession of Syrian
kings who reigned at Damascus and lifted the city-state to the
apogee of its power to become the inveterate foe of Israel for
a full century and a half has been remarkably illuminated by archeology.
 Veiled in obscurity and plagued with problems, this general period
is now much better understood as a result of the discovery of
the inscribed stele of Benhadad I, discovered in north Syria in
1940.  This important royal inscription in general confirms the
list of the early Syrian kings as given in 1 Kings 15:18, where
&quot;Benhadad&quot; is said to be &quot;the son of Tabrimmon,
the son of Hezion, king of Aram, who lived in Damascus.&quot;
 According to W. F. Albright's rendering of the Benhadad monument
(with the somewhat uncertain restoration of a partly undecipherable
portion), the sequence is identical: &quot;Birhadad, son of Tab-Ramman,
son of Hadyan, king of Aram.&quot;  &quot;Birhadad&quot; is equivalent
to &quot;Barhadad&quot; (Aramaic) or &quot;Benhadad&quot; (Hebrew),
and Tab-Ramman and Hadyan are equatable with Hebrew Tabrimmon
and Hezion.
<P>
 Although the correct name of the first king of Damascus has been
settled by archeological evidence, the problem of the identy of
Rezon, who seized Damascus during Solomon's reign and apparently
ruled there (1 Kings 11:23-25), is still unslved.  Is Hezion identical
with Rezon?  If so, the form Rezon is secondary and is to be regarded
as something of a corruption of Hezion.  If this is not the case,
which appears unlikely, Rezon must be excluded from the dynastic
list of 1 Kings 15:18, which is improbable in view of the fact
that he was clearly the founder of the powerful Damascene state,
and imparted to it thet temper of hostility toward Israel which
was to become hereditary in the kings who followed and which was
to make it one of he most agressive and dangerous of enemies.
<P>
<B>Benhadad I.</B>  By the time Benhadad I entered into the succession
of Syrian kings (c. 890 BC), Syria had grown so formidably in
power that it was the strongest state in this region of western
Asia and ready to seize any opportunity to expand its domains.
 Such an occasion presented itself when the hard-pressed Asa,
king of Judah (c. 917-876 BC), sent an urgent appeal to Syria
for aid against Baasha, king of Israel (c. 900-877 BC), who, pushing
his frontier southward to within five miles of Jerusalem, proceeded
to fortify Ramah as a border fortress commanding the capital of
Judah (1 Kings 15:17).
<P>
 In desperation the king of Judah sent what was left of the temple
and royal treasure plundered so recently by Shishak to Benhadad
as a bribe to lure Syria into an alliance with himself against
Israel.  In resorting to this expedient Asa followed a policy
which Abijam his father had inaugurated of resorting to an alliance
with Damascus whenever Israel's aggression toward the south became
dangerous (1 Kings 15:19).
<P>
 Asa's strategy was at least immediately successful for Benhadad
invaded northern Israel and forced Baasha to abandon Ramah and
retire to his capital city Tirzah  (1 Kings 15:20-22).  But the
cost was more than the king of Judah bargained for.  In courting
the favor of Damascus against Israel, he gave an unparalleled
opportunity for aggrandizement to what was in reality a common
threat and placed both Hebrew kingdoms in the position which was
actually that of semi-subservience to a mutual foe.  With Israel
and Judah in deadly struggle the rise of Damascus to power was
virtually unhindered.
<P>
<B>Benhadad I and II.</B>  Before the discovery of the inscribed
stele of Benhadad, scholars were almost universally accustomed
to distinguish between Benhadad I, son of Tabrimmon, son of Hezion,
the contemporary of Asa and Baasha (1 kings 15:18) and Benhadad,
the contemporary of Elijah and Elisha.  Only occasionally did
a biblical scholar, such as T.K. Cheyne, recognize the possibility
that the two might be identical.  The majority, however, assumed
that the so-called Benhadad I died during the early years of the
reign of Omri or Ahab (c. 865 BC), and was succeeded by Benhadad
II.
<P>
 However, evidence furnished by the stele of Benhadad strongly
argues for the identity of Benhadad I and Benhadad II.  In addition,
careful researches in the vexing problems of the chronology of
the Israelite and Judahite kings of this period have resulted
in the reduction in the regnal years, notably of Israelite kings,
and have obviated any serious objection to the equation on the
ground of an impossibly long reign for Benhadad I.
<P>
 A further argument of moment commonly urged against the identification
of Benhadad I with benhadad II is the word of the vanquished Syrian
monarch to King Ahab of Israel after the latter's notable victory
at Aphek, recorded in 1 Kings 20:34: &quot;the towns which my
father took from your father, I will restore; and you will set
up markets for yourself in Damascus as my father did in Samaria.&quot;
<P>
 This reference can scarcely be to Ahab's father Omri (c. 876-869
BC), who founded the metropolis of Samaria as the capital of the
Northern Kingdom, for available sources do not lend the least
support to the theory that the latter suffered a defeat in a clash
with Syria.  The term &quot;father&quot;, especially when used
of royalty, must frequently be construed as &quot;predecessor&quot;,
as is clearly illustrated by the monuments.
<P>
 Doubtless towns wrested from Israel by early Syrian kings such
as hezion or Tabrimmon during the reign of Jeroboam I (c. 922-901
BC) or his son Nadab (c. 901-900 BC), concerning which, however,
tere is no biblical record, are intended.  This period, though
extremely obscure concerning events in Damascus, certainly witnessed
a formidable expansion in Syrian might.  There is ample reason
to conclude that the hard-pressed Jeroboam had to make important
concessions to Syria at this time.
<P>
 Benhadad's use of the expression &quot;Samaria&quot; was evidently
formulaic.  The city had been so strategically situated and enjoyed
such a prosperous growth that very early after its founding by
Omri its name was popularly transferred to the whole Northern
Kingdom of which it was the capital, and many paralels from western
Asia may be cited where the name of a country and its capital
city became identical.  The Syrian king was simply using a newer
designation of Israel for the older one, and the commercial privileges
to which he alludes may have been established in Tirzah, Shechem,
or some other towns of the Northern Kingdom before, of course,
it was styled &quot;Samaria.&quot;
<P>
<B>Israel and Aram in Conflict</B>
<P>
 Since his invasion of northern Israel in the reign of Baasha
(c. 900-877 BC), Benhadad I had gained control of the rich caravan
routes westward to the Phoenician ports.  The result was that
immense wealth flowed into Damascus, which enabled it to amass
great strength for its important role as the dominant Syrian state.
 It was natural for Aramean merchants to take advantage of this
circumstance to seek to monopolize Phoenician commerce and to
attempt to capture the Israelite trade market.
<P>
 However, Benhadad now faced a different situation after the death
of Baasha and the founding of a new Israelite dynasty under Omri.
 Never before had the Syrian monarch been called upon to deal
with such dangerous rivals as Omri and his son Ahab proved to
be.
<P>
<B>Benhadad I and Omri. </B> The reign of Omri (c. 876-869 BC)
ushered in a new era of Israelite power and influence in Syro-Palestinian
affairs.  Diplomatically Omri took steps to establish close ties
of affiliation with Phoenicia to offset the threat of Syrian commercial
monopoly, which resulted in the marriage of his son and successor
to Jezebel, daughter of Ethbaal, king of the Sidonians (1 Kings
18:18).
<P>
 In other directions Omri showed vigor in dealing with foreign
powers.  The famous Moabite stone set up by King Mesha of Moab
at Dibon, north of the Arnon, about 840 BC, discovered in 1868,
discloses that it was Omri who gained control of northern Moab,
occupying its cities and exacting a heavy tribute.  The inscribed
stele which is of great importance, runs:
<P>
 I am Mesha, son of Chemosh [a Moabite deity -- cf. 1 Kings 11,
which mentions that Solomon started worshipping this god]...king
of Moab, the Dibonite...Omri, king of Israel...oppressed Moab
many days because Chemosh was angry with his land.  And his son
succeeded him, and he also said, I will oppress Moab....Now Omri
annexed all the lands of Madeba, and Israel occupied it, his days
and half his sons' days, forty years, and Chemosh restored it
in my days.
<P>
 Omri's choice of Samaria as a strategic new site for a capital
and his elaborate building operations and extensive fortifications
there greatly strengthened his kingdom against the increasing
Syrian menace.  Modern excavations at the site have verified the
greatness of the ancient city and the stratigraphy of Israelite
times shows taht periods I and II belong to Omri and Ahab; III
to the time of Jehu (2 Kings 10:17); and periods IV to VI to the
eighth c. BC when the city reached its height of prosperity. 
Remains of strong walls and numbers of large cisterns are mute
evidences of Samaria's ability to hold out to terrible lengths
against protracted siege, first by the Syrians (2 Kings 6:24-30)
and then finally against the mighty Assyrians (2 Kings 17:5).
<P>
 The virile measures adopted by Omri to cope with Benhadad's growing
prestige were assisted by a new factor on the political horizon.
 The advance of Assyria, although it brought a new source of anxiety
to Israel, acted as a further restraint upon the Arameans.  This
is doubtless the reason tehre is no evidence of a Syrian invasion
of Israel during Omri's reign or that the Israelite king was ever
a tributary to Benhadad I.
<P>
 However, whether merely by virtue of his foreign reputation as
a founder of a new dynasty and a rulder of energy or in some more
direct way, the initial contact between Israel and Assyria evidently
occured during Omri's day, for from that time on Israel appears
in cuneiform recores at <I>Bit-Humri</I> (&quot;house of Omri&quot;).
 This official Assyrian appellation was applied to Samaria, the
capital city.  Moreover, the designation of an Israelite king
became <I>Mar-Humri </I>(&quot;son of Omri&quot;).  Tiglath-pileser
III's reference to the land of Israel over a century later by
its official name <I>Bit-Humri</I> evidences the significance
of Omri as a ruler in Israel (despite the Bible's disparaging
words about him.  In fact, it illustrates that one can gain the
whole world and yet lose one's soul.  Omri may have been significant
to the rest of the world, but to God, he was nobody).
<P>
<B>Benhadad I and Ahab.</B>  Omri's son Ahab (c. 869-850 BC) assiduously
continued the general policies of his father, strengthening his
kingdom within and without against the day of eventually dealing
with the Arameans.  To this end he continued to develop Samaria
as an imperial bastion and royal residence, besides building and
fortifying many other places, including Jericho (1 Kings 16:34;
22:39).  He also endevored to improve greatly his diplomatic position.
 To his treaty with Tyre, cemented by royal marriage and the introduction
of the Tyrian cult of Baal-Melcarth into Israel, he added a protective
alliance with the Southern Kingdom, sealed by another royal union
when he gave his daughter, Athalia, in marriage to Jehoram, the
crown prince of Judah (2 Kings 8:18, 26).
<P>
 The long threatened attack from Syria came some five or so years
before the end of Ahab's reign.  At the head of a coalition of
32 vassel kings Benhadad suddenly appeared before the gates of
Samaria (1 Kings 20:1).  Ahab's brilliant strategy not only won
this battle, on this occasion, but also the one during the following
year, when he won an even more decisive victory over the Syrians
at Aphek, east of the Sea of Galilee, on the road from Damascus
to Bethshan (1 Kings 20:26-43).
<P>
 The next year, however, the appearance on the horizon of a powerful
Assyria marching toward Syria-Palestine compelled Ahab and his
hereditary foe, Benhadad, to ally themselves in a general coalition
of neighboring kings to block the ambitious Assyrian move southward.
 Ashurnasirpal II (883-859 BC), whose formidable fighting machine
had extended Assyrian power to the Mediterranean, kept clear of
Damascus and Israelite territory.  His son Shalmaneser III (859-824
BC), however, directed Assyrian might southwestward in rpeated
campaigns against Syria and Palestine.  The Monolith Inscription,
now in the British Museum, recores the military expeditions of
the king during the first six years of his reign and includes
a description of his clash with the Syrian coalition headed by
&quot;Hadadezer [Benhadad] of Aram [Damascus]&quot; in 853 BC.
 The battle took place at Karkar, north of Hamath in the Orontes
Valley, a strategic fortress city, which guarded the approach
to all lower Syria.
<P>
 Conspicuously mentioned along with Hadadezer [Benhadad], is &quot;Ahab,
the Israelite&quot;.  The Israelite ruler's prominence is indicated
by the large number of chariots he is said to have furnished to
coalition -- two thousand as compared to only twelve hundred with
Hadadezer, and 700 of &quot;Irhuleni of Hamath&quot;, mentioned
third.  But Hadadezer furnished twice as many soldiers as Ahab,
20,000 against his 10,000.
<P>
 In extravagant terms, Shalmaneser claims a great victory, which
can well be doubted, since he did not press on toward Hamath,
which he certainly would have done had his victory been decisive.
 Nor was he able to report any further successes, nor did he resume
his attack on Hamath or Damascus until some half dozen years later.
<P>
<B>Benhadad and Joram.</B>  According to the available documents
Ahab was the last ruler to be listed in the Assyrian records as
a foe of Shalmaneser.  The Israelite king met his untimely death
(c. 850 BC) in his attempt to recover Ramoth in Gilead from the
Syrians, when the old hostility flared up as the Assyrian menace
abated after the battle of Karkar (1 Kings 22:1-51).  The revolt
of Moab on Ahab's death occupied his weak and sickly son Ahaziah
(c. 850-849 BC) and Joram (c. 849-842 BC).
<P>
 In 848 BC, in the eleventh year of his reign, Shalmaneser III
made another thrust into Syria.  In this campaign he was met by
a confederation of &quot;twelve kings of the seaboard&quot;, again
headed by Adadidri (Benhadad I) of Damascus and Irhuleni of Hamath.
 On this occasion, however, no mention is made of Israel's participation
in the coalition.  The same is true of his fourteenth regnal year
(845 BC), when he made a supreme effort to invade central and
southern Syria, as the Bull Inscription records (recorded on two
large bull-colossi recovered from the center of the mound at Calah
[Nimrud]).  Ahab's death at the hands of the treacherous Syrian
in attempting to recover Ramoth in Gilead, which Benhadad perfidiously
failed to return to Israel in accordance with the treaty of Aphek
(1 Kings 20:34), doubtless was reason enough that his sons decided
rather to face the Assyrian menace than join the Syrian coalition
in 848 and 845 BC with Damascus in the old place of leadership.
<P>
<B>Hazael and Jehu.</B>  Benhadad's long and energetic reign came
to an end about 843 BC or slightly later.  By 841 BC Hazael, an
official of influence in the service of the court at Damascus,
had already usurped the throne.  On a pavement slab from Nimrud
(Calah) Shalmaneser records his crossing the Euphrates River for
the sixteenth time in the eighteenth year of his reign (841 BC)
and his attack upon Hazael (Haza'ilu) of Damascus.  A text from
Asshur describes this significant change in the dynasty at Damascus
and strikingly confirms the biblical account (2 Kings 8:7-15):
&quot;Adadidri forsook his land [idiom meaning, &quot;died violently&quot;
or &quot;was murdered&quot;].  Hazael, son of nobody, seized the
throne.&quot;
<P>
 Hazael's contacts with Joram, who in the confusion incident upon
the shift of dynasty at Damascus, evidently recovered Ramoth Gilead
(2 Kings 8:28; 9:14), were destined to be short-lived.  Not many
months elapsed before the new Syrian king was confronted by a
new Israelite ruler, a usurper like himself.  Jehu (c. 842-815
BC), initiating a violent political and religious purge in Israel,
incurred the implacable hatred of Hazael by submitting to Shalmaneser
III in his invasion of 841 BC rather than joining Syria in resisting
the Assyrian advance.
<P>
 The Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser III, which Austen Layard found
in 1846 in the imperial palace at Nimrud, shows Jehu actually
kneeling before the Assyrian emperor.  Following the prostrate
king come Israelites bearing gifts. The inscription reads: &quot;Tribute
of Iaua [Jehu], son of Omri.  Silver, gold, a golden bowl, a golden
beaker, golden goblets, pitchers of gold, lead, staves for the
hand of the king, javelins, I received from him.&quot;
<P>
 Hazael, single-handed, withstood the Assyrian attack in 841 BC
and was able at least to ward off a crushing blow.  But Damascus
took a terrific pummeling in the attack from &quot;the giant among
the Semites&quot;.  For several more years Hazael was occupied
with the peril of imminent aggression by Assyria, but after Shalmaneser's
final effort to subdue central and southern Syria, in the twenty-first
year of his reign (837 BC), he was compelled to abandon his Syrian
campaigns to attend to more pressing problems in the north.  Neither
he nor his son Shamsi-Adad V (824-815 BC) was able to undertake
a new campaign against middle or southern Syria.
<P>
 Hazael, at last set free for ambitious plans of his own for territorial
expansion, began relentlessly to harass Israel, especially in
the East Jordanic country.  As the Aramaeans pitilessly &quot;threshed&quot;
Gilead and Bashan &quot;with threshing instruments of iron&quot;
(2 Kings 10:32-33; Amos 1:3-4) and more and more encroached upon
Israelite territory, Jehu must have realized how badly he had
gauged the international situation in placating Assyria.
<P>
<B>Hazael and Joahaz.</B>  At Jehu's death in 815 BC a renewal
of Hazael's relentless attacks on Israel soon reduced his son
Joahaz (815-801 BC) to such an extreme stage of abasement that
the Israelite king became little more than a retainer of the Arameans
(2 Kings 13:1-9, 22, 25).  By imposing rigid military restrictions
on Israel, whose territory had shrunk to include not much more
than the hill coungtry of Ephraim, Syrian armies were free to
pass at will through Joahaz's realm.  Soon Hazael found himself
in possession of the Philistine plain.  Destroying Gath, he was
in a position to attack Jerusalem.  He was warded off only by
the payment of a large sum raised by stripping the temple (2 Kings
12:17-18).
<P>
 As far as the extension of his sway toward the south is concerned,
Hazael appears as the greatest of the Aramean conquerors, who
ruled at Damsacus.  Although there is no concrete evidence of
any extensive conquests of his in the north, his reign brought
his country to the position of the chief power in all Syria and
embraced the period of its greatest territorial control.  The
reappearance of Assyria in the west under Adadnirari III (805-782
BC), however, proved that Hazael's empire built up by brute force
and coercion, lacked intrinsic solidarity.
<P>
 Whereas a unified Syria had met and checked Shalmaneser's career
at the time of Benhadad I, Adadnirari's westward march gave no
evicence at all of such unity.  Grating that Damascus escaped
actual destruction, it apparently did so by its own resources,
which, hoever, were insufficient to save it from an oppressive
tribute.  According to the Saba'a stele discovered in 1905 and
now in the Constantinople Museum, Adadnirari says:
<P>
 I gave the command to march against Aram.  I trapped Mari' [Hazael]
in Damascus, his royal city.  I received ... one hundred talents
of godl, and one thousand talents of silver.
<P>
 Even such countries which Hazael is known to have taken, such
as Bit Humri (Israel) and Palastu (Philistia), revolted in the
crisis and sent tribute to Assyria.  From the upper portion of
a slab found at Nimrud (Calah) an inscription of Adadnirari lists
among other countries, &quot;Tyre, Sidon, Humri (Omriland=Israel),
Edom, Palastu (Philistia)&quot; as lands, he says &quot;I brought
in submission to my feet.  I imposed tribute and tax upon them.&quot;
<P>
 After a long reign of at least forty years, like David, Solomon,
Asa, and Uzziah in Judah, and like Jeroboam II in Israel, Hazael
died in 801 BC or slightly later.  The fact that Adadnirari III
for the year 802 BC (and perhaps several years earlier) names
Mari' as king of Damascus must be explained under the supposition
that his term is a second name of Hazael, and is merely a popular
title of the kings of Damascus, and like an abbreviation of a
name like &quot;Mari'-Hadad&quot;, meaning &quot;Hadad is my lord&quot;.
<P>
 Doubtless significant in this connection is the inscription found
on one of the ivories from the site of Arslan Tash in north Syria,
which carries the name &quot;our lord Hazael&quot; and dates from
the era of this famous Syrian king.  Other similar ivories found
at Nimrud, ancient Calah, are dated somewhat later, since an Assyrian
tablet of inventory lists them as booty from Damascus in the time
of Hazael's successor.
