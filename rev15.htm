<BLOCKQUOTE>1. And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvellous, seven angels having seven plagues, which are the last, for in them is finished the wrath of God. <P>
2  And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire; and them that come off victorious from the beast, and from his image, and from the number of his name, standing by the sea of glass, having harps of God. <P>
3  And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvellous are thy works, O Lord God, the Almighty; righteous and true are thy ways, thou King of the ages. <P>
4  Who shall not fear, O Lord, and glorify thy name? for thou only art holy; for all the nations shall come and worship before thee; for thy righteous acts have been made manifest.</BLOCKQUOTE> <P>

In the face of the impending judgement of God the Christian must remember that there is no reason to be arrogant or take for granted that everyone but them will have to give an answer to God for their life.  The just and the unjust will appear before God!<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>5. And after these things I saw, and the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened: <P>
6  and there came out from the temple the seven angels that had the seven plagues, arrayed with precious stone, pure and bright, and girt about their breasts with golden girdles. <P>
7  And one of the four living creatures gave unto the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and ever. <P>
8  And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power; and none was able to enter into the temple, till thegels should be finished. </BLOCKQUOTE><P>

Judgment is coming!  This chapter is a parenthetical one which describes the fact that judgement, when it comes, will be perfect and complete.  The number 7 once again supplies us with this information.<P>
