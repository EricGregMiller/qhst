<P>
When you think of ancient wisdom, what is the first image that
pops into your mind? For some it might be a Greek philosopher,
poised in silent contemplation, surrounded by a myriad of faithful
pupils eagerly waiting to hear his words of truth. For others,
it might be a Renaissance man seated smugly behind a huge wooden
desk, craftily penning uncensored wisdom due to his recent &quot;enlightenment.&quot;
Perhaps some other era of human achievement stands out to you
as a particularly poignant example of ancient wisdom and thought.
To be sure, each epic of mankind's life has brought with it a
characteristic ideal, branding a distinctive mark upon the course
of history. Now, I'd like to invite you to travel back centuries,
even millenniums ago, to an ancient culture whose brand has never
quite left the hearts and lives of humankind. The ideals of these
people are still foundational to man's beliefs and institutions
today. I'd like to take you back to the wisdom of the Hebrew people,
with the hope of hearing the message that their literature still
proclaims today.
<P>
<B>A Distinctive Mark</B>
<P>
What is it that sets the wisdom of the Hebrews apart from the
other cultures of their time? The answer to this question likes
in knowing the presuppositions that they held as part of life
itself. This in turn lays the foundation to understanding the
message that their literature proclaims. There truly is a difference
in the assumptions that formed the framework for the Hebrew thinking,
and the assumptions of the other nations of the time; the most
distinguishing being their beliefs about God.
<P>
Unlike other cultures of the day, the Hebrew people believed in
one God, and His Name was YHWH. That in itself was distinctive
because most other cultures engaged in polytheistic worship, where
not one god, but many were exalted. Yet, it is not merely their
belief in one God that set the foundation for Hebrew thinking
and living; it is what they believed about Him that made the difference.
The Hebrew people saw God as one who was actively involved in
human life. He created all things (Psalm 104:24), sustains all
things (Psalm 145:16), is sovereign over all things (Psalm 67:4)
and so demands the respect and worship of his handiwork (Psalm
150:6). This foundational belief concerning God's role in human
affairs effected the Hebrews perspective and perception of life
itself. God was not distant, but involved in all human life, directing
its events and circumstances. As a result, the felt a unique relationship
wit Him, one of friendship as well as accountability; they were
His people, and He was their God (Psalm 95:6-7).
<P>
In contrast to this, other cultures of the time saw their gods
as removed from everyday human life. Their divinities were too
busy fighting with each other to be overly concerned with mere
mortals. Two of the most prominent societies of the time were
the Egyptians and the Babylonians. The Egyptians had a complex
system of religion that included a multiplicity of gods, often
represented by animals such as a cat, baboon, or lion. Even through
modern research it is hard to piece together a complete system
of Egyptian religion because of the inconsistent and confusing
information left behind. Many of the gods and goddesses seem more
or less identical, yet they existed together. Contradictory myths
explaining the creation of the world, natural phenomena, and the
like were accepted without argument. Attributes of deities were
freely and indiscriminately adopted from one group or locality
to another, and combinations and fusions of gods were frequent.
The Egyptian gods were made by the people, fabricated to suit
their desieres and ideas. Unfortunately, these gods could not
be counted upon to be faithful or loyal to their followers. Blessing
was based upon flattery and offerings.
<P>
Likewise, the Babylonian system of religion revolved around many
personalities, most of which were related to nature. Their religious
ideas developed as a result of other Near Eastern religions in
the Mesopotamian area. In their theological thinking, man was
created for the benefit of the gods. His whole purpose was to
serve, proved for, pamper, worship, and revere them. in return,
the people could hope for protection and blessing, even though
the personalities of their gods were, more often than not, abusive
and cruel. Warfare, revenge, murder, and the like were, common
behaviors to expect from the Babylonian deities.
<P>
Thus, the contrast of theology between these cultures and the
Hebrew people is evident. The god of the Hebrews was not dependent
upon them, they were vitally dependent upon Him. His nature was
one of justice and mercy, blessing and provision. He was sovereignly
involved in their existence, loyal and almighty. How did this
belief affect their understanding of life? They had Someone to
answer to, who required obedience and reverence, but at the same
time, was pleased to be known as their God. This caused their
wisdom to become more than ethereal, idealistic thought. It brought
about a very practical understanding and ideal for and about life.
One must live righteously, trusting in YHWH alone to be the source
of help and strength in every situation; help that they could
count upon, because of his faithfulness. This is the ray of hope
that emanates from the Hebrew people which outshines all of the
other cultures of the day, and which enabled them to trust in
God and wait for His salvation. As the Psalmist said, &quot;Whoever
is wise, let him heed these things and consider the great love
of the Lord&quot; (Psalm 107:43).
<P>
<B>Practical Advice for Living</B>
<P>
One look at the book of Proverbs and it is evident that the Hebrew
wisdom was practical advice for living. There are rare passages
that refer to abstract ideals (perhaps the most frequent being
the personification of wisdom as a woman), but for he most part,
it is a book that meets people were they live and tells them how
to do it successfully. This practicality comes from their theological
presuppositions about God. in their eyes, he was the Almighty
One and living in obedience to his law was what a righteous, blessed
life was all about. In other words, someone who is smart will
obey the one who knows it all anyway!
<P>
These proverbs can be broken down into two general categories:
the first being the characteristics of a &quot;righteous&quot;
life (such as their speech, actions, motives, etc.), and the second
being how people should relate to each other (relationships such
as marriage, parenting, employer/employee, government, etc.).
All of the advice in the book of Proverbs centers around one word:
wisdom. That is the heart of their search for finding good success
and blessing in life. in fact, the prologue of the book begins
with this explanation, &quot;The Proverbs of Solomon, son of David,
king of Israel: for attaining wisdom...&quot; (Proverbs 1:1-2a).
The purpose of this collection of Hebrew maxims is to attain wisdom.
The word &quot;wisdom&quot; carries with it the idea of skill,
primarily in the management of life. The Hebrews were not impressed
with haphazard living that had no direction or purpose. They sought
skillful and Godly wisdom, which would in turn beget a righteous
and blessed life.
<P>
This practical advice is not without a theological emphasis. Over
and over again, it is pointed out that true wisdom, real skill
for living comes from the Lord first. One of the most often repeated
of the Hebrew proverbs goes, &quot;The fear of the Lord is the
beginning of wisdom&quot; (Prov. 1:7, 9:10, and 15:33). This was
not a fear in the sense of being scared of God, but rather a deep
reverence and respect for Him and His Word which would motivate
one to obedience. In the Hebrew mind, a blessed life began by
attaining wisdom, which in turn began by coming into a relationship
with the Lord. A relationship with God was the foundation to it
all.
<P>
<B>Unpretentious Philosophy</B>
<P>
Along with practical wisdom for living day to day, the Hebrews
did deal with philosophical questions about life such as suffering,
calamity, inequity, and injustice. The difference between their
perspective and that of their contemporaries, is that the were
not always understood and could not always be explained. So, Hebrew
thought left the unexplainable unexplained. This is not to intimate
that they somehow ignored crisis and inequity, or gave a pseudo-intellectual
answer. As is reflected in their writings, they honestly questioned
and openly confronted both man and God. Yet, ultimately some things
were beyond knowing, at which point the Hebrews responded with
the attitude, &quot;God sees and knows, and I will trust in Him.&quot;
<P>
In view of their beliefs concerning the nature and character of
God this attitude is not a &quot;cop-out.&quot; It is a reality.
God is God, the Sovereign One, and mankind is His workmanship.
Hebrew wisdom magnifies the greatness and power of God above the
circumstance in an unpretentious and practical way. Although it
doesn't give a lot of &quot;answers,&quot; it seeks God as the
giver of wisdom and the keeper of the deepest mysteries of the
heart. he will keep the care for those who will trust in Him.
The book of Psalms exemplifies this more than any of the other
Hebrew wisdom literature. Even in the midst of heartache and suffering,
the Psalmist again and again cries out to God in confidence that
he will hear and deliver. Consider these verses in light of their
honest cry and plea for help from the Lord in the face of injustice
and evil:
<P>
<blockquote>O Lord, how many are my foes!
<br>
how many rise up against me!
<br>
many are saying of me, &quot;God will not deliver him.&quot;
<br>
But You are a shield around me, O Lord;
<br>
You bestow glory upon me and lift up my head.
<br>
To the Lord I cry aloud and he answers me from His holy hill.
<br>
(Psalm 3:1-3)
<P>
I wait for the Lord,
<br>
my soul waits,
<br>
and in His word I put my hope.
<br>
My soul waits for the Lord more than the watchman waits for the
morning,
<br>
more than the watchman waits for the morning
<br>
(Psalm 130:5-6)</blockquote>
<P>
Unpretentious and uncomplicated, the Hebrews were a people who
could come to God with complaint as well as praise and know that
He would hear and respond to both.
<P>
<B>Answers to Life's Questions</B>
<P>
The Hebrew Wisdom Literature specifically refers to the books
of Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Solomon. These
stand out from other portions of the Hebrew Writings in that they
deal less with the Old Testament themes of Law, Covenant and History,
and instead give voice to the cries of the human heart. Questions
that poke at the depth of the soul are addressed and dealt with.
&quot;What is the meaning of life? What is the purpose of man's
existence? how does one reconcile the fact that suffering and
inequity can rage through the life of those who are righteous
and innocent?&quot; These are the type of hones questions which
the Hebrews posed to an Almighty God. In researching these writings,
it seemed to me that they could be broken down into the following
categories.
<P>
<table>
<tr><td><B>Book</B></td><td><B>Idea Addressed</B></td></tr>

<tr><td>Job</td><td>  Why does suffering happen to the righteous and why doesn't
God do something about it?</td></tr>

<tr><td>Psalms </td><td>The expression of man to God through heart cries of joy,
sorrow, and trust, exalting God as the Almighty God, King, Deliverer,
and Creator.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Proverbs </td><td>The expression of man to man in light of God's counsel
and wisdom, teaching practical living and righteous, godly attitudes
and actions.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Ecclesiastes </td><td>The expression of man to himself, questioning the
seeming inequities and folly of life.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Song of Solomon </td><td>The expression of the love of God to his people
through a lyric poem about a King and a Shulamite daughter.</td></tr></table>
<P>
<B>Evil vs. Good: Why Does it Happen?</B>
<P>
One of the most prevalent questions that the Hebrew writings approaches
is the question of evil vs. good. As in every human life and culture,
there is always ample circumstance to drive men and women to this
question: &quot;Why does evil seem to triumph over good, if good
is supposedly greater than evil?&quot; The Hebrew people dealt
with this theme in their wisdom literature, and arrive at several
possibilities. In reconciling this seeming inconsistency of life,
one is often forced to believe that either God purposely uses
evil as a tool to achieve His purpose and plan, or that evil is
more powerful than good. The framework for such reconciliation
is built upon three presuppositions, and it is hard to find a
solution to the question of evil vs. good that doesn't offend
at least one of these basic beliefs about God.
<P>
The three presuppositions are: (1) God is good - His nature is
one of complete purity and mercy which allows for His great benevolence
to flow freely to humankind; (2) God is great - He is more powerful
than the forces that could rage against Him or His people; (3)
Evil exists - despite the goodness and power of the lord, there
is no way to deny that fact that evil exists, and too often triumphs
over people, both innocent and guilty alike. When these beliefs
are challenged by unwelcome circumstances, one must find a way
to reconcile the paradox without forfeiting the belief. If one
determines that God is no longer good, then the foundation for
belief in a Holy God is tainted by the idea that there is somehow
some &quot;evil&quot; in His own being. If one decides that God
by nature is good, but of no greatness or power, then the foundation
for belief in a Mighty God who is able to deliver disintegrates.
If one denies that evil does not exist, that it is only a superstitious
idea, then reality is distorted. What results? The tendency is
to just assume that God is too distant to care, much less be involved.
God must be removed from it all, taken out of the picture, and
humankind is left alone to survive the best he/she can.
<P>
The Hebrew Wisdom Literature holds more hope than this. It unyieldingly
acknowledges the goodness and greatness of the Lord, but never
denies the existence of evil. The heart of each book maintains
and promotes a steadfast belief in God's ability to bring ultimate
good out of even the worst of situations.
<P>
The account of Job is perhaps the most popular resource of the
Wisdom Literature when faced with this question of evil vs. good.
Here we are greed with the reconciliation of the suffering of
man in light of true Hebrew thought. As one examines the message
of the book of Job, it is evident that the answer to human suffering
is not merely a matter of simple logic. In a discourse between
the afflicted Job and his three friends, the question is presented,
answered out of human reasoning and assumption, and finally overridden
by the Word of God directly to Job. Although there is never a
clear black and white response given, the sovereignty and ultimate
power and justice of the Lord is upheld, and Job is vindicated
for his faith in God.
<P>
The book of Job begins with God's stamp of approval on &quot;His
servant Job.&quot; The Lord makes the statement, &quot;Have you
considered My servant Job? There is no one on earth like him;
he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil&quot;
(Job 1:8). Job is a prosperous and blessed man who is known for
his integrity. When Satan comes and accuses him before God, he
uses this integrity and prosperity as the point of accusation.
Satan says to the Lord, &quot;Does Job fear You for nothing? Have
You not put a hedge around him and his household?&quot; (vs. 1:9-10a).
In other words, Satan is saying, &quot;Of course Job serves You.
You have blessed him and he just wants to make sure that the blessing
continues.&quot; The very godliness in which God takes such great
delight is, in the Accuser's opinion, really void of all integrity
because it is a self-serving righteousness out of greed. Let the
favor of God be removed and Job would surely curse God. When God
allows Satan to wreak havoc in Job's life, the stage is set for
a great debate about theodicy: is God just? How can God permit
the suffering of Job through evil attacks of Satan, and still
be a good and just God? So, in the book of Job, the question of
evil vs. good is approached as a theological question through
the suffering of a righteous and upright man named Job.
<P>
Job loses his ten children, his entire animal stock (including
7000 sheep, 3000 camels, 500 oxen, and 500 donkeys), all his servants,
and most of his personal property within the course of a single
day. If that weren't enough, he is then afflicted with a painful
disease. Thus begins the anguish of Job, robbed of every sign
of God's favor for no apparent reason. Evil seems to have triumphed
over this righteous man's life.
<P>
One by one Job's friends come to offer him their advice as to
why this sudden calamity has visited Job and his entire household.
Because the Hebrew mind would never allow the idea that God was
somehow mistaken (He was no longer good), or that he had lost
his power (He was no longer great), they were rushed by simple
human logic to this conclusion: Job had sinned and was now reaping
the just punishment for his wicked ways. In their eyes, Job had
transgressed the Law of God and the suffering he was facing was,
in effect, all his fault. This answer, however, merely pours salt
on the wounds. To tell someone in the midst of pain that they
are only reaping what is just before God because of their sin
is not only foolish, but as God makes clear in Job's case, untrue
(Job 42:7b). Job's friends were not privy to the mind of God,
and even job himself was at a loss to explain the reason for the
sad circumstances he faced - a fact the Hebrew wisdom writer of
Job wanted to make very clear. As much as the human mind would
like to, it can not reduce bitter, seemingly unjust suffering
to a consistent pattern of personal sinfulness. On the contrary,
Job's sufferings appear not as God's judgment, but as His confidence
that Job's integrity was authentic and true, based not in greed
or self-gain, but in humble faith and love.
<P>
The book ends with Job's justification and restoration (more than
he had to begin with) and the rebuke of his three friends for
&quot;not speaking what was right.&quot; (Job 42:7b). Even in
Job's complete confoundment at God and the suffering, he spoke
honestly and deep down trusted in His sovereignty and righteous
character. Unlike his friends, he didn't offer a quick theological
platitude, and despite his mistakes in word and attitude at times,
God saw his heart of faith and vindicated his integrity.
<P>
The wisdom of this book magnifies the sovereignty of God. In the
midst of personal suffering, when evil has for all real purpose
triumphed over the innocent, one does not challenge the Lord in
arrogant, self-justifying defense. Instead, one must relax in
His sovereign grace to deliver. One of the central themes in the
book of Job is that mankind doesn't and won't have the understanding
of God for every situation encountered. The unpretentiousness
of the Hebrew Wisdom literature shines brilliantly in this conclusion.
There is no clear cut solution. God doesn't answer Job's questions,
but He does answer the need of his heart. Thus, evil is not greater
than good, although it touches humankind in unexpected severity
at times. The advice of the ancient Israelites is not a formula,
but a sigh. Ultimately, things happen in which we are limited
in our horizon of understanding to explain. Yet, rest assured
that God is still good and just, and faith in Him never disappoints.
<P>
The book of Ecclesiastes approaches the dilemma of evil vs. good
in a different way. At first reading, it could seem that the answer
the writer of Ecclesiastes gives to the question, &quot;Why does
evil happen?&quot; is simply this: all mankind is trapped in a
vain and meaningless cycle of inequity.
<P>
The extreme pessimism of the response is due to the fact that
from his human observation, everything that one does, whether
good or bad, leads to the same end: the grave. So if death is
all that awaits the individual, then the ultimate good in life
must be to enjoy what you can now. The writer argues, &quot;So
I commend the enjoyment of life, because nothing is better for
a man under the sun than to eat, drink and be glad&quot; (Ecc.
8:15). This motto has followed down the path of history, even
to our present age, as is evident by the abundance of &quot;if
it feels good, do it&quot; attitudes that are prompted in almost
every form of media available. People still wrestle with the inability
to see beyond the present and maintain an eternal perspective.
<P>
A look beyond the obvious uncovers the true message and wisdom
of this writing. Ecclesiastes is more than just a grouping of
negative, fatalistic proverbs. It is a search; for meaning in
this life and a longing for eternity, or as J. Sidlow Baxter put
it, it is a &quot;quest for the chief good.&quot; The disjointed
and obscure style of the book serves to emphasize the point that
the book itself is trying to make. There is no sense, sometimes,
to the vanity of life. It often appears that people struggle to
do good and come out no better than those who are deceitful and
self-serving. Yet, this perspective is not the answer, just the
observation. As God reveals His grace to mankind in the form of
His Son Jesus Christ, we come to a new understanding that life
hold much meaning, and eternity is a real truth that unfolds the
ultimate plan and purpose of God. Life in Christ is not bound
by the grave and so there is reason to rejoice and believe that
inequity will be corrected and vanity replaced by fulfillment.
<P>
How does this book represent the wisdom of the Hebrews? It shows
the honest assessment of a life lived for one's own pleasure and
profit, without a living, vibrant knowledge of God, and bound
by the confinement of the grave. With such a perspective, there
will naturally be a pessimistic and painful tone in the reading.
The conclusion of such an observation? &quot;Now all has been
heard; here is the conclusion of the matter: Fear God and keep
His commandments, for this is the whole duty of man. For God will
bring every deed into judgment, including every hidden thing,
whether it is good or evil&quot; (Ecc. 12:13-14). Ultimately,
the wisdom of the Hebrews again points to the sovereignty of God
to bring about justice and judgment. In light of His underlying
presence in the affairs of all human life, the best thing to do
is to revere and obey Him, leaving the rest to his discernment.
Because the Hebrew people did not put much thought into an afterlife
at this time in their history, this answer was as good as the
revelation of God's grace could give them for the moment. Similar
to the book of Job, Ecclesiastes resolves itself to the mighty
hand of the Lord with unpretentious faith in His power and goodness.
Evil may exist, inequity may abound, but in the end God still
has the last word.
<P>
The book of Psalms provides another glimpse into the mind of the
Hebrew people as they sought to understand evil vs. good. The
150 songs collected in the book of Psalms express a wide range
of prayers and praises to the Lord. Heart cries of joy, sorrow,
and trust are echoed over and over again. God is exalted as the
Almighty One, the King, the Creator, and Deliverer. Yet, unlike
the books of Job and Ecclesiastes, Psalms does not seek to provide
a theological observation about the purpose of suffering or the
meaning of life. It is simply a book revealing the human heart's
cry to a real and present God. Psalms shows the intimacy that
one could have with the Lord, sharing in the deepest tragedies
and highest joys of life. God is not distant and uninvolved. He
is caring and aware of all. With this as an anchor to their cries,
the songs of the book of Psalms are filled with pleas for divine
intervention, deliverance and justice. They seem to intimate that
though evil may rage against the godly and upright, God who is
good and great, will bring about true salvation for all who will
wait and trust in him. A good example of this is found in Psalm
62:5-8 which reads:
<P>
<blockquote>Find rest, O my soul, in God alone;
<br>
my hope comes from him.
<br>
He alone is my rock and my salvation;
<br>
he is my fortress, I will not be shaken.
<br>
My salvation and my honor depend on God;
<br>
he is my mighty rock, my refuge.
<br>
Trust in him at all times, O people;
<br>
pour out your hearts to him, for God is our refuge.</blockquote>
<P>
The wisdom of this book is not a philosophical debate. It is a
practical expression of the heart of man to a Living God. The
book of Psalms acknowledges the problem of evil prevailing over
the innocent, but still ascertains that God is able, and will,
bring about true justice in the end.
<P>
<B>The Final Word</B>
<P>
If you want to hear the message of the Hebrew Wisdom Literature,
then tune your ears to the practical, unpretentious song of faith
in a sovereign and caring God. Consistently throughout their writing,
this is the bottom line to their thinking. Whether it be in the
face of suffering or blessing, defeat or victory, the Hebrew people
knew that they had been called by a God who was good and powerful.
Faith in Him would bring about reward and see to it that all inequity
would be made right: a powerful truth that can bring much peace
to our own hearts.
<P>
Love the Lord and do what is right: this was the heart of the
Hebrews and this is still the call of God to all humankind.
