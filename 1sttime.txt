Welcome to Personal Web Pages Site Manager. This program enables you 
to upload photos, images, sound files, even complete HTML pages you 
create offline, to your own Prodigy Web site.

You can also manage your Web server directory by deleting or moving 
unneeded files back to your PC.  Remember to name your main HTML file 
index.html or index.htm.  That will be the first file that the user 
sees.

Be sure to check Help if you need assistance with any Site Manager 
feature.
