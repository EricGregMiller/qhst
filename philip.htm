<B>Introduction</B>
<P>
 Hope.  Its a simple word which has, from the very beginning,
been a part of the Christian vocabulary.  Hope is essential for
the Christian, as for any and every person.  Paul said, on one
occasion, &quot;if it is in this life alone that we have hope,
we are of all people the most to be pitied&quot;.
<P>
 In considering the state of the Church today, one must come to
the conclusion that there is an overwhelming sense of hopelessness
among many Church members.  Baptisms are on the decline; the mainline
churches are watching their members drop out in droves; and there
seems a plethora of journal articles which are written specifically
to encourage the church to adopt new methods to re-attract its
wayward members.  What can be done for the faithful Church member,
the reflective church member, lay and clergy, who watch this decline
with broken and heavy hearts?
<P>
 I would like to suggest that, as has always been the case, there
is comfort to be found in the Scriptures of the Church.  In particular,
the letter of Paul to the Philippians can be and is a word of
hope amidst the most testing of circumstances.  The purpose of
this short work, then, is to examine this excellent epistle so
that we can hear afresh its wonderful words of comfort and hope.
<P>
 Some may think it odd that I do not make reference to other commentaries
and studies.  In my experience, too many works designed for the
general public are often filled with extraneous material, designed
to impress rather than express the truth of the text.  With that
in mind I have intentionally left aside the very helpful and indeed
valuable comments of my colleagues in the field.  Instead, I have
attempted to listen to the text alone.  Those interested in questions
not covered herein are happily directed to those other worr
 One final note in regards to what lies ahead.  The translation
that follows is partially my own (where I felt the necessary emphasis
was lacking in other translations) and the NRSV.
<P>
 
<P>
 The hope which is available to the Christian is hope which is
irrepressible and powerful.  The letter to the Philippians is
filled with hope and hopefulness, and thus will serve as an excellent
source for a discussion of the hope which is available to the
believer in Christ.
<P>
 Before we can begin our exposition of the text, it will be very
helpful for us to place the epistle in the framework of Paul's
life.  In this way we will be able to understand what he says
and why he says it.
<P>
 Paul evidently established the Church at Philippi on his second
missionary journey (around the year 49 A.D.).  The church at Philippi
would prove to be a constant source of support and encouragement
to the apostle as he continued his missionary work.  Not only
did they provide him financial support (Phil 4:16, 2 Cor 11:9,
Phil 4:10), they also sent him an assistant (Phil 2:25) and continuously
prayed for his welfare and work.  Moreover, Paul established the
Church at Philippi as the first Christian congregation on European
soil.  In sum, then, this church was a supportive, concerned,
and faithful congregation- the kind of Church anyone would be
pleased to serve.
<P>
<B> Chapter 1</B>
<P>
 <B>1 &quot;Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus; to all
the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi along  with the
elders and deacons&quot;:&quot;&quot;</B>
<P>
 Hope arises, first of all, when we realize that we are not alone
in the Christian life or struggle for truth.  Along the way God
sends us folk who will help us, encourage us, and support us.
 We must then look around to those people in our lives who have
been given us by God.  In that way we will remember His goodness
to us and  
<P>
 
<P>
<B> 2  &quot;Grace to you all and peace from God our father and
from the Lord Jesus Christ&quot;.</B>
<P>
 Hope comes when we recognize that God is the source of peace.
 We need fear nothing because God has already given us peace and
strength through Christ.  
<P>
 
<P>
<B> 3  &quot;I give thanks to my God every time I think of you,
4  always, in all my prayers for you, I pray for you with joy&quot;,
</B>
<P>
 Hope also arises when those placed in our lives by God are considered
to be a blessing and a help rather than a bane or an irritant.
 Paul does not complain about them to God, he thanks God for them.
 Certainly they were at times unfaithful, and perhaps even inconsiderate
(as we all are); yet Paul does not focus on them, but on God!
 Hopelessness and despair are the only fruits borne of the tree
of negativity.  
<P>
 
<P>
 <B>5 &quot;for your participation in the spread of the Gospel,
from the very beginning until this very moment&quot;.</B>
<P>
 When people are prayed for, instead of being prayed against,
then it is much more likely that they will participate in the
life of faith.  And they will participate in the spread of the
Gospel- they will not leave it to someone else!   
<P>
 
<P>
 <B>6 &quot;being extraordinarily confident of this very thing:
that the one who started this good work among you will carry it
out until the &quot;Day of Jesus Christ&quot;.</B>
<P>
 The result of this approach is an overwhelming sense of confidence,
not in people, or self, but in God.  And it is this sense of confidence,
this awareness of God, which is the foundation and basis of ho
  pe itself.  per 
<P>
<B>7 &quot;And I am certain that it is right that I think this
way of you, because I know that you hold me dear; in my defense
of the Gospel as a prisoner you remain my fellows in the grace
of God&quot;,</B>
<P>
 It is indeed a wonderful thing to recognize that God cares for
us, not by Himself alone, but along with other folks.  If we can
hear this aright, we can hear that God is so overwhelmingly kind
to us that he gives us partners along the way who will pray for
us and support us; as we them.   
<P>
 
<P>
<B> 8 &quot;for God bears me witness, that I am confident of your
standing as participants in the mercy extended by Christ&quot;.</B>
<P>
 We often hear folks say that &quot;we can't be sure of our own
salvation, much less anyone else's&quot;.   Paul here denies such
a notion and expresses his confidence in their standing with God.
 How much more positive the lives of our comrades in the faith
would be if we would tell them that we see the marks of grace
in them!  How much hope could be engendered if we would tell others
we see Christ active in their lives!!!      
<P>
 <B>9 &quot;And this is what I pray, that your love  may increase
more and more and overflow into knowledge and insight into all
things.  10 So that you can differentiate between the sincere
(and insincere) and so that you become blameless in the &quot;Day
of Christ.&quot;  </B>
<P>
 So, seeing the marks of grace in their lives, Paul notes that
he continues to pray that they may keep on the path and love more
and learn more, and that they will grow in sincerity and in their
ability to distinguish from sincere and insincere actions in their
own lives.     
<P>
 
<P>
 <B>11 &quot;Having been fill   ed with the fruit of rist so that
God is praised and glorified.&quot;</B>
<P>
 The result of their growth will ultimately be the praise of God.
 That is the very purpose of growth.  When God's people grow,
he is praised as the &quot;gardener&quot; who knows the appropriate
way to help his garden flourish.  Everything in the believer's
life should be done &quot;Ad gloriam Dei&quot; (to the glory of
God).   This being done, the life of the believer will blossom
in fruitfulness.  So what are these fruits of the Spirit?  Galatians
6 tells us (to which the reader is referred):  love, joy, peace,
patience, kindness, gentleness, meekness and self control.   

<P>
 <B>12 &quot;But, brothers, you know my desire that the things
that happen to me serve to further the cause of the Gospel.  13
That in spite of my chains Christ is manifested to everyone in
the Praetorium and to everyone else around me,&quot;  </B><P>
 The
hope which Paul expresses here is very significant.  He says this
same thing in a number of ways in different places, but the main
idea is that he trusts God to such a degree that no matter what
happens to him personally, the Gospel will continue on its course.
 This may be the very idea which the author of Acts has in mind
when he maintains, at the end of his book, that the Gospel was
preached by Paul and continued to spread &quot;unhindered&quot;.
 This should be the goal of every believer; &quot;no matter what
happens to me, I will not be a hindrance to the good news&quot;.
<P>
 <B>14 &quot;and the rest of the Christian brothers, having been
emboldened by my chains,  are fearless in speaking the &quot;Word.&quot;
 </B>
<P>
 And so it is- when one becomes an example of hoping faithfulness,
others will observe it and adopt that lifestyle themselves.  They
will become bold in their witness and fearless of the conseq 
 uences; which they wil 
<P>
 <B>15  &quot;But some preach Christ because of envy and jealousy,
and some  from positive motives.  16 The one from love knowing
that I am steadfast in the defense of the Gospel,  17 But the
others preach Christ out of a sense of envy.  Not because they
love Christ but because they want to increase my sorrow in imprisonment.
 18 So what?  Only this matters; that Christ is preached.  Whether
from envy or love- and in that I rejoice.&quot;  </B>
<P>
 Even the most wonderful things can be and are cheapened by the
wiles of the envious and jealous.  How often it has happened that
some adopt Christ because it is popular and they want to be in
the &quot;in-crowd&quot;.  How many crusades and revivals are
characterized not by sincere conversion but instead by a desire
to walk down the aisle with the mob and shake the famous evangelist's
hand.  How many children and young people have walked an aisle
because their friends have- yet they have no faith.
<P>
 But these things do not discourage Paul.  Christ is Preached!
 The seed is planted, and the Gospel is heard.  For this Paul
is profoundly grateful. 
<P>
 
<P>
 <B>19 &quot;For I know that this will result in my deliverance
through the Spirit of  Jesus Christ because you are constant in
your prayers for me.&quot;</B>
<P>
 You see that Paul's hope is bolstered by the knowledge that others
are praying for him.  Perhaps hope in the Christian community
today would increase if prayer for others would increase.  Its
very easy to talk about being spiritual, listen to pop Christian
music, and go to the preacher's conferences; its very hard to
pray; but the latter is far more significant than the former.
<P>
<B>20 I have a hopeful and anticipatory expectation that
I will never be ashamed (of Christ), but that I will always be
able to glorify Christ in my life- whether I am alive or dead.&quot;
</B>
<P>
 This verse contains the central concept of the letter.   Paul
anticipates what he will shortly spell out in full.  He has such
confidence and hopefulness in the God that he serves that he is
firm in his conviction that he will not ever be ashamed of the
good news.   Neither life nor death can dissuade him from this
hope.  Instead, the opposite is the case;  he will magnify Christ
no matter what.  This is a stark contrast to the disposition of
hopelessness found among many of the disciples of Christ today.
<P>
 For Paul, nothing could evoke an attitude of hopelessness.  Why?
 How could Paul maintain his confidence, his trust, his hope in
God?  Verse 21 and the remainder of the letter will spell out
this ground and essence of confidence and hope.   
<P>
<B>21 &quot;For to me, life is a gift of Christ, and death
is not fearsome.&quot;</B>
<P>
 The primary reason that Paul has such hope is because whether
he is alive, or passed from this life to the next, he sees himself
as being in the hands of Christ.  Life is Christ's gift and death
is simply a passing from this life to full life with Christ. 
Hope, for Paul, is bound to this central concept: he belongs to
Christ in life or death.  He is secure in the grace of God, and
nothing that happens to him can change this wonderful fact.  Even
if he dies, he need not fear- thus his hope is founded upon the
rock of confidence in God and therefore cannot be shaken. 
<P>
 <B>22 &quot;But if I am to continue to live in the flesh, then
fruitful work will continue:  which one I desire I do not know.
 23 I remain caught between the two, what I would like is to depart
and be with Christ -- that would be better for me 24 but, on the other hand,
to remain in the flesh would be better for you.&quot; </B>
<P>
 Alive -- to continue the work God has begun in him; or dead- forever
more alive in the presence of Christ.  Which one he wants the
most remains uncertain for Paul.  Either way, he knows that God
is with him and therefore his hope remains constant.  
<P>
 <B>25 &quot;No matter what happens, I am confident, and I know
that I will remain and continue steadfast with you as you progress
in your faith and joy.&quot;</B>
<P>
 No matter what, he will remain their constant companion in the
faith journey.   
<P>
 <B>26 &quot;So that you and I together can boast because of Christ
Jesus when I come to you again.&quot;  </B>
<P>
 As always, Christ is the center of the life of Paul.  Because
he shares this in common with the Philippians, they have a common
 ground for rejoicing and hope.  Again, you see, Paul is reminding
them and us that we are not alone!  
<P>
 <B>27 &quot;Behave as citizens of the Gospel of Christ. so that
whether I come and see you or simply hear of your activities,
I will know that you are remaining steadfast in the Spirit as
one body living out the Gospel faith.&quot;  </B>
<P>
 Seeing that you do not stand alone, make sure that you do not
behave in such a manner that those standing with you will be pulled
down if you should fall.  Remain steadfast no matter what. 
<P>
 <B>28 &quot;and do not be fearful at all because of our enemies;
 their behavior is simply evidence of their impending destruction,
while your behavior is evidence of your salvation, (and this a
gift of God).&quot;</B>
<P>
 Or, as Jesus said, &quot;you know a tree by its fruit&quot;.

<P>
<B> </B>
<P>
<B>29   For it has been granted to you to have the privilege not only to believe in Christ,
but also to suffer for Him, 30 since you and I share the same
suffering.&quot;</B>
<P>
 Or, as the famous three Musketeers might say, &quot;one for all
and all for one&quot;.  The Christian community is above all else
a fellowship and communion of the saints.  When one suffers all
suffer; and when one rejoices all have cause for joy.  Unfortunately
this wonderful sense of solidarity is lost to many of our comrades.
 If they could find their way back to it, then hope would easily
be restored to us all, together.
<P>
<B>Chapter 2</B>
<P>
 <B>1 &quot;If there is any comfort in Christ, if there is any
consolation from love, if there is any fellowship with the Spirit,
if there is any sense of compassion,&quot;</B>
<P>
 Of course Paul is stating a fact rather than asking a question
here.  There is comfort in Christ and compassion among them. 
Because this is so, he can ask something of them:
<P>
 <B>2 &quot;fill up my joy by being unified in love and purpose,&quot;</B>
<P>
 What he asks is that they have a unity of mind and purpose that
has its basis in love.  If Christian folk love one another then
they can overlook any differences which may exist between them.
 The world would then take note of this love and be attracted
to the Gospel instead of being repelled by the multi-faced bickering
it often sees.   
<P>
 <B>3 &quot;not acting out of envy, nor out of vanity; rather
acting out of a humble respect for one another consider others
as more important than yourselves.&quot;</B>
<P>
 This is easier said than done- but hope can exist only where
there is humility.  Where one exalts himself above another there
can only be discord; and discord breeds hopeles   sness; and hopelessnesleads
to abandonment of the principles of the faith.    
<P>
 <B>4 &quot;And do not concern yourself simply with your own affairs,
but be  concerned about others as well.&quot; </B>
<P>
 Self centeredness is the bane of spirituality. 
<P>
 <B>5 &quot;Your thoughts must become like the thoughts of Christ
Jesus,&quot;</B>
<P>
 But how?  Is it possible for us to think the way Jesus thought?
 Is this, in fact, what Paul is saying?  In this regard he is:
 that Christian folk adopt an attitude of humility which reflects
the humility offered by the lifestyle of Christ.  To illustrate
his point, Paul quotes a well known early hymn which they had
no doubt sung many times.  It follows in its entirety:
<P>
 <B>6 &quot;Who, being in the form of God did not deem equality
with God something to be clung to,  </B>
<P>
<B>7 but instead humbled himself and took the form of a slave,
the likeness of humanity; and lived a human life   8 humbling
himself and rendering obedience that resulted in death, and this
the horrid death on the cross.   9 Because of this obedience God
glorified him and gave him a name superior to every name,  10
so that when Jesus name is mentioned every earthly, heavenly,
and subterranean knee should bow,   11 and every tongue confess
that &quot;Jesus Christ is Lord&quot; to the glory of God the
father.&quot;</B>
<P>
 This hymn is an excellent example of complete devotion to God
because of Christ.  When one realizes that everything is heaven
and hell is subject to Christ then one truly does have nothing
to fear.  
<P>
<B>    12 ends, just as you are always obedient, not only when
I am with you but also when I am absent; struggle to put into
practice your salvation (with reverence and respect):&quot; </B>
<P>
 Because, you see, Christ is in complete control, his followers
are here encouraged to put into practice a lifestyle which is
consistent with their relationship to him.  Here they are encouraged
not to bring about their own salvation, but to put into practice
the gift they have received, with a respectful and reverential
attitude.  Why?  The following verse tells us the reason:
<P>
 <B>13 &quot;For God is the one who is at work in you to bring
about an attitude which is consistent with His good will.&quot;
</B>
<P>
 God is the one who brings about this internal change of attitude.
 From self service to God service; this is God's work.  He implants
in our hearts the desire to serve Him.  It is, therefore, His
work.  For this reason hope is kindled in the heart of the believer:
 If it is God's work (and it is) then I have absolutely nothing
to worry about.  Absolutely NOTHING!  I am therefore free to serve
Him with no concern with the outcome of that service.  
<P>
 <B>14 &quot;Do everything you do without grumbling and mumbling,&quot;</B>
<P>
 This response can only come into practice when we truly believe
that God is in charge.  Since it is his work, we can do our part
without complaining.  In this way, and only in this way, will
the world see that what the Gospel declares is the truth.  As
verse 15 will show:
<P>
 <B>15 &quot;so that you may become blameless and without stain,
children of God, blameless in the very midst of a hardened and
confused generation; in which you shine as lights in the world.&quot;
 </B>
<P>
 It is only when the Church acts like the Church, and not like
a club tha   t it will be a light iworld.    
<P>
<B> 16 &quot;hold fast to the word of life, so that we can boast
of you in the &quot;Day of Christ&quot;,  knowing that it was
not in vain that I worked or ran.&quot;</B>
<P>
 The translation of this verse is more &quot;ad sensum&quot; than
literal.  The sense which Paul is communicating here is that he
wants them to hold on and continue in the faith; and on the day
of Christ this will serve as evidence that he had not wasted his
life in the effort of evangelism.
<P>
 Hope, for Paul, is bound up with human responsiveness and continuation
with the Gospel.  He hopes in God and in his children in the faith.
 This paradox is typically Pauline!  He lived in a world of paradoxes!
<P>
 <B>17 &quot;But, even if I am offered as a sacrifice on the altar
of service for your faith, I rejoice for myself and for you. 
18 Likewise you must also rejoice with me.&quot; </B>
<P>
 Yet, the paradox continues, no matter what happens he will rejoice.
 And he expects that they will as well. 
<P>
 <B>19  &quot;Now I hope through the Lord Jesus to send Timothy
to you very soon, so that I may be informed of your activities.&quot;</B>
<P>
 Not because he wants to spy on them; rather he is concerned to
hear how they are doing.
<P>
<B>    20 &quot;For I have no one equal to him in his genuine
concern for your welfare. 21 For all others seek their own best
interests, not those of Jesus Christ. 22 But Timothy has been
well tried, as you know.  He was like a son to me as his father
and he has served with me in the work of the gospel.<P></B>
  Paul is confident that Timothy is as dear to him as he is to
Timothy.  For this reason he is able to entrust him with the important
task of seeing to the welfare of the Philippians.  Again, Paul
reminds his readers that he is not alone in his work.  None of
us are if we will but look around and see the &quot;great cloud
of witnesses&quot; that surround us as we do our work.</B>
<P>
<B>   23 &quot;I plan to send him as soon as I see how things
go with me; 24 and I trust the Lord that I will also come soon.&quot;</B>
<P>
   When Paul is certain of his fate, whatever it may be, he would
send Timothy to them to inform them.  Still he felt confident
that he would be able to make the journey to them himself in due
course.  Regrettably, Paul was executed shortly after his letter
was written.  Thus he was unable to fulfill his desire to see
them again.
<P>
   <B>25 &quot;Yet I think it essential to send to you Epaphroditus,
my brother and co-worker and fellow soldier, and also your servant
and minister to my need; 26 for he is desirous to see all of you,
and has been depressed because you heard that he was sick. 27
He was, truly, so sick that he nearly died. But God had mercy
on him, and not only on him but on me also, so that I would not
have sorrow on top of sorrow. 28 Thus I am the more eager to send
him: in order that you may rejoice at seeing him again, and that
I may be released from my anxiety. 29 Welcome him then in the
Lord joyfully, and honor people like him, 30 because he came close
to death in his work for Christ by risking    his life to make
up for the help you could not render me.&quot;</B>
<P>
   In these concluding verses of the second chapter, Paul mentions
another co-worker of his.  This co-worker was most likely the
Pastor of the Philippian community who had been sent to Rome by
the Church to minister to Paul.  The significance of this fellow
lay in his self sacrificing service to Paul on behalf of his fellow
Christians.  He nearly died in his efforts; and this is one of
the greatest acts of selflessness.  For any number of reasons
Paul commends this faithful man to his church family; but the
overriding reason is his love as exemplified in his kindness.
<P>
   Once more Paul reminds them, and us, that no one is alone in
living for Christ or working for Him.  Even in the most dire of
circumstances God will send us co-workers who share our loads,
and indeed lighten them considerably.  Thank God!  When Jesus
told his disciples that his &quot;burden is light&quot; he meant
that his followers would have burdens, but not burdens that would
bury them.  To this end God sends us friends.  Epaphroditus was
such a gift from God for Paul.
<P>
<B> Chapter 3</B>
<P>
   <B>1 &quot;Finally, my brothers,  rejoice  in the Lord.  To
write the same things to you is not tiresome to me, and it is
essential to you&quot;.</B>
<P>
   Once more Paul reminds his friends at Philippi that it is absolutely
essential for their spiritual well being that they continue to
have dispositions that rejoice in God.  Though he has said this
a number of times in writing as well as in person, he maintains
that such a procedure is to their advantage.   This is so because
the Christian life must always look above instead of around. 
Christians must constantly remind themselves that circumstances
may change- but God does not   ; and neither does his  
<P>
   <B>2 &quot;Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil doers, beware
of those who mutilate the flesh.  3 For we are the circumcision,
the spiritual people who serve God  and boast in Christ Jesus
and have no confidence in the flesh.&quot;</B>
<P>
   Accordingly, Paul wants to strongly reinforce in their minds
that they must beware of those opponents of his who would mislead
them into thinking that salvation is possible outside of the gift
of grace.   
<P>
<B>   4 &quot;Though I, too, have reason to boast in the flesh.
 If anyone else has reason to boast in the flesh, I have more:
5 circumcised on the eighth day, an Israelite, of the tribe of
Benjamin, a Hebrew born of Hebrew parents; as to the law, a Pharisee;
6 a zealous persecutor of the church; blameless in righteousness
under the law.&quot;</B>
<P>
   So Paul proceeds to describe his pedigree: if salvation can
be gained by ones heritage, then he surely could make such a claim.
 Yet, he argues, such heritage does not mean that one is right
with God.  This is great cause for hope: for if we need not be
from the best families; and if we need not be the best or the
brightest, then there is surely hope for us as well.  For salvation
does not depend on us, but on God.  It is His gift and not our
&quot;just desserts&quot;.
<P>
   <B>7 &quot;Yet whatever gains I had, these I have come to regard
as loss because of Christ. 8 More than that, I regard everything
as loss because of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus
my Lord. For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things,
and I regard them as rubbish, in order that I may gain    Christ
  and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that
comes from the law, but one that comes through faith in Christ,
 the righteousness from God based on faith&quot;.</B>
<P>
   Because salvation is a gift, Paul sets aside everything in
order to live his life in light of that gift.  In fact, his heritage
takes a back seat to his new inheritance.  He has hope that God
will, in spite of his past, make use of him in the present and
in the future will allow him to be with Christ.     
<P>
   <B>10 &quot;I want to know Christ  and the power of his resurrection
and the sharing of his sufferings by becoming like him in his
death, 11 if somehow I may attain the resurrection from the dead.
 12 Not that I have already obtained this or have already reached
the goal; but I press on to make it my own, because Christ Jesus
has made me his own. 13 Beloved,  I do not consider that I have
made it my own;  but this one thing I do: forgetting what lies
behind and straining forward to what lies ahead, 14 I press on
toward the goal for the prize of the heavenly  call of God in
Christ Jesus.&quot;</B>
<P>
   To forget the past and move into the future is one of the most
significant things that any person can do.  How easy it is to
live in the past; to dwell on its accomplishments and its failures.
 But living in the past makes it impossible to live in the present.
 For this reason alone Paul shares the fact that he has abandoned
the past and lives only for the future.  Paul has not forgotten
the lessons    of the past, but he ha move ahead and not be chained
to the past.
<P>
   Perhaps this is why Paul is the apostle of hope.  For hope
to come alive, the past must be learned from and then left behind.
 (N.B., from this point on, the translation followed is the New
Revised Standard Version).
<P>
    <B>15 &quot;Let those of us then who are mature be of the
same mind; and if you think differently about anything, this too
God will reveal to you. 16 Only let us hold fast to what we have
attained.&quot;</B>
<P>
   Paul here recapitulates what he has maintained already; learn
from the past and let it go- do not be bound to it or chained
by it.  But how?  This, as we all know, is much easier said than
done.  Paul will now tell us how.
<P>
   <B>17 &quot;Brothers and sisters,  join in imitating me, and
observe those who live according to the example you have in us.
18 For many live as enemies of the cross of Christ; I have often
told you of them, and now I tell you even with tears. 19 Their
end is destruction; their god is the belly; and their glory is
in their shame; their minds are set on earthly things. 20 But
our citizenship is in heaven, and it is from there that we are
expecting a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ. 21 He will transform
the body of our humiliation that it may be conformed to the body
of his glory, by the power that also enables him to make all things
subject to himself.&quot;</B>
<P>
   How can we leave the past behind?  By focusing our attention
on our behavior in the present and our life with Christ in the
future; by denying ourselves and taking up our c   ross and following
Himorgiving hands and living out the gratitude that fills our
hearts.  Hope is borne of such behavior and such an outlook. 
But despair is borne of  dwelling in the past.

<P>
<B>Chapter 4</B> 
<P>
   <B>1 &quot;Therefore, my brothers and sisters, whom I love
and long for, my joy and crown, stand firm in the Lord in this
way, my beloved.&quot;</B>
<P>
   Or, in other words, remain faithful and realize that you are
part of a wonderful community of love, joy and peace.  Do not
abandon this community for if you do, you will be abandoning love,
joy and peace.  Remain filled with the confident hope which comes
from active participation in the community of faith; and let no
one turn you aside from this way of life.
<P>
   <B>2 &quot;I urge Euodia and I urge Syntyche to be of the same
mind in the Lord. 3 Yes, and I ask you also, my loyal companion,
 help these women, for they have struggled beside me in the work
of the gospel, together with Clement and the rest of my co-workers,
whose names are in the book of life.&quot;</B>
<P>
   And, should a disruption arise in the community, then do your
best to settle it  Remind the combatants that they belong to one
another, and together to Christ.  Remind them of their former
friendship and struggle for the faith, and help them to realize
what they are risking by fighting over petty issues (for all issues
are petty when compared to the glory of Christ).  Keep hope alive,
especially in interpersonal relationships.  
<P>
   <B>4 &quot;Rejoice  in the Lord always; again I will say, Rejoice.
 </B>
<P>
<B>5 Let your gentleness be known to everyone. The Lord is near.</B> <B>6 Do not worry about
anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving
let your requests be made known to God. 7 And the peace of God,
which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and
your minds in Christ Jesus.  8 Finally, beloved,  whatever is
true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure,
whatever is pleasing, whatever is commendable, if there is any
excellence and if there is anything worthy of praise, think about
 these things. 9 Keep on doing the things that you have learned
and received and heard and seen in me, and the God of peace will
be with you.&quot;</B>
<P>
   What remarkable encouragement is contained in these few verses!
 don't worry, don't fear, don't despair -- God is in control.  His
peace will be your constant companion.  He will watch over you
and He will be with you.  What other need do you have?  Keep your
mind on the positive and it will not be poisoned by the negative.
 In sum, keep your gaze steadily fixed on your Lord, and you will
have nothing to worry about.  Oh, to be sure, you will have troubles
and difficulties; but you will not need to worry about any of
them.
<P>
   <B>10 &quot;I rejoice  in the Lord greatly that now at last
you have revived your concern for me; indeed, you were concerned
for me, but had no opportunity to show it.  11 Not that I am referring
to being in need; for I have learned to be content with whatever
I have. 12 I know what it is to have little, and I know what it
is to have plenty. In any and all circumstances I have learned
   the secret of being wf having plenty and of being in need.
13 I can do all things through him who strengthens me. 14 In any
case, it was kind of you to share my distress.&quot;</B>
<P>
   This passage likewise contains some remarkable ideas.  Paul,
like all of us, was in need of support and encouragement, and
he was not afraid to say so.  Likewise we must admit our need
of one another.  There are a lot of folks who believe themselves
to be independent; but they are not.  All of us are interdependent.
 We need each other!  We cannot live without one another!  Therefore
we must do our best to live with one another and support one another
in the love of God.
<P>
   <B>15 &quot;You Philippians indeed know that in the early days
of the gospel, when I left Macedonia, no church shared with me
in the matter of giving and receiving, except you alone. f1 16
For even when I was in Thessalonica, you sent me help for my needs
more than once. 17 Not that I seek the gift, but I seek the profit
that accumulates to your account. 18 I have been paid in full
and have more than enough; I am fully satisfied, now that I have
received from Epaphroditus the gifts you sent, a fragrant offering,
a sacrifice acceptable and pleasing to God. 19 And my God will
fully satisfy every need of yours according to his riches in glory
in Christ Jesus.&quot;</B>
<P>
   Paul is not here arguing for what can best be called a theology
of reciprocity.  Instead, he is suggesting that helping others
is its own reward; and real charity desires nothing but the opportunity
to be a blessing.  It gives without expecting  any return.  Yet
a simple truth of  life is that we will be treated by others the
way    we treat others.  Paulteful to God for them.  All of us
have been aided on the way, and owe it to God to aid others on
their way; the same way that Paul was aided, and thereafter aided
others.
<P>
    <B>20 &quot;To our God and Father be glory forever and ever.
Amen.   21 Greet every saint in Christ Jesus. The friends  who
are with me greet you. 22 All the saints greet you, especially
those of the emperor's household.</B>
<P>
<B>23 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.&quot;</B>
<P>
  Paul concludes his letter with a prayer for the Philippians;
and a greeting from the brothers and sisters.  Thus, the letter
closes the same way that it opens; with the recognition that God
is worthy of adoration and because He loves us He has made us
part of a community of disciples who love Him as we do.  &quot;Stand
fast therefore, in the faith in which you were called&quot;.
