<I><B>4. If a person gets a hysterectomy or vasectomy for birth
control purposes only, is this against God's will, considering
the fact that our body is a vessel and he also said replenish
the earth?</B></I>

 For Catholics, any form of birth control (except possibly the
"Natural Family Planning" method) is considered against God's will and
would be classified as sin.  For Protestants, it is generally
considered a matter of conscience (see Romans 14), since the Bible
is silent on the issue.  There is no place in the Bible that says
one cannot use birth control (I would not agree that Onan's behavior
in Genesis 38 is relevant to the question, since his sin came
in failing to perform his duty -- in that culture -- of raising
up an heir for his dead brother.  By thus failing to produce an
heir for his dead brother, he hoped to become the sole heir of
his father's estate.  Onan's sin, therefore, is essentially that
of greed).
<P>
 Personally, I disagree with the arguments commonly raised that
to use something like birth control (or some other human intervention
in nature, especially in biology) is to resist God's will.  One
could make the same arguments about anything that we as human's
do, whether taking aspirin to relieve a headache, building a
bridge to cross a river, or performing open-heart surgery.  &quot;If
God had meant for us to...(fill in the blank)&quot;  
<P>
 Human intervention in the natural order of things is not resisting
God's will, since we are no less parts of his creation, and he
doubtless has taken our behavior patterns (which he designed in
the first place) into consideration in his plans.  He made us
in his image, after all, which would suggest he intended us to
do godlike things.
<P>
 So far as the statement to &quot;fill the earth&quot; means,
that is rather general and I don't think that birth control has
kept us from doing this, since the world population is presently
larger than it has ever been in history.  The population is growing
principally because not so many people are dying anymore.
