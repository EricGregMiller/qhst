identified with Samydake in Carmania on the eastern side of the
Persian Gulf. This seems to rest on nothing more than superficial

A. Sons of Aram:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
1. Uz = Gen 10:23; the home of Job -- see Job 1:1; Jer 25:20 &quot;all
the kings of the land of Uz&quot;; Lam. 4:21 &quot;daughter of
Edom, that dwells in the land of Uz.&quot; Gen 2:21, the son of
Nahor by Milcah, and the elder brother of Buz. Gen 36:28, a son
of Dishan, son of Seir the Horite. The land of Uz was probably
the pastureland inhabited by one of the tribes of that name. From
the book of Job, we know that the land was subject to raids by
the Chaldeans and the Sabaeans (Job 1:15, 17); Job's three friends
were a Temanite, a Naamathite and a Shuite (2:11). Elihu was a
Buzite (32:2) and Job himself is called one of the children of
the East (Kedhem). The Chaldaeans (Kasdim, descendants of Chesed,
son of Nahor, Gen. 22:22), inhabited Mesopotamia; a branch of
the Sabaeans also appears to have taken up its abode in Northern
Arabia. Teman (Gen. 36:11) is often synonymous with Edom. The
meaning of the designation Naamathite is unknown, but Shuah was
a son of Keturah the wife of Abraham (Gen. 25:2), and so connected
with Nahor. Shuah is identified with Suhu, mentioned by Tiglath-pileser
I as lying one day's journey from Carchemish; and a &quot;land
of Uzza&quot; is named by Shalmaneser II as being in the same
neighborhood. Buz is a brother of Uz (&quot;huz,&quot; Gen. 22:21)
and son of Nahor. Esar-haddon, in an expedition toward the west,
passed through Bazu and Hazu, no doubt the same tribes. Abraham
sent his children, other than Isaac (so including Shuah), &quot;eastward
to the land of &quot;Kedhem&quot; (Gen. 25:6). These factors point
to the land of Uz as lying somewhere to the northeast of Palestine.
Tradition supports such a site. Josephus says &quot;Uz founded
Trachonitis and Damascus&quot; (<I>Antiquities</I>, I, vi, 4).

Sheleph = the name of a Yemenite tribe or district, named on Sabaean
inscriptions and also by Arabian geographers, located in Southern
Arabia.

Hazarmaveth = clan or district in South Arabia. It is represented
by the modern Hadramaut, a broad and fruitful valley running nearly
parallel with the coast for about 100 miles, north of el-Yemen.
The ruins and inscriptions found by Glaser show that it was once
the home of a great civilization, the capital being Sabata (Gen.
10:7)

Jerah = (moon); southern Arabia worshipped the moon and there
are several place names linked to the moon as a result; in Yemen
there is a place called Yurakh and in Hijaz there is a Yarah.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Hadoram = Arabia?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Uzal = the name is identical with the Arabic `Auzal, the old capital
of Yemen, later called San`a'. San`a' is described as standing
high above sea-level in a fertile land, and traversed by a river
bed which in the rainy season becomes a torrent. Under the Himyarite
dynasty is succeeded Zafar as the residence of the Tubba`s. If
it is the same place as the Audzara or Ausara of the classics,
it is clear why Arabic geographers dwell upon its great antiquity.
The most celebrated feature of the town was Ghumdan, an immense
palace, the building of which tradition ascribes to Shorahbil,
the sixth known king of the Himyarites. According to Ibn Khaldoun
this building had four fronts in color red, white, yellow and
green respectively. In the midst rose a tower of seven stories,
the topmost being entirely of marble (Caussin de Perceval, <U>Essai</U>,
II, 75). In the seventh century AD the town became the capital
of the Zaidite Imams, and the place was destroyed toward the middle
of that century by order of the caliph Othman.

Ophir = Gen. 10:29. the name of a land or city somewhere to the
south or southeast of Palestine for which Solomon's ships along
with Phoenician vessels set out from Ezion-geber at the head of
the Gulf of Akabah, returning with great stores of gold, precious
stones and &quot;almug&quot; wood (1 Kings 9:28; 10:11; 2 Chron.
9:10; 1 Kings 22:48; 2 Chron. 8:18). The gold from Ophir was proverbial
for its purity (Ps. 45:9; Job 28:16; Isa 13:12; 1 Chron. 29:4).
In Job 22:24, the word Ophir is used for the fine gold itself.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The geographical location of Ophir has been the subject of much
debate with three regions being principally advanced: India and
the Far East; Africa; and Arabia.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<B>INDIA</B> 
<P>
The wares mentioned as coming from Ophir are appropriate to that
part of the world.
<P>
&quot;Almug&quot; wood is conjectured to be Indian sandal-wood.
<P>
Another argument is based on the resemblance between the LXX form
of the word (Sophera) and the Coptic name for India (Sophir).
<P>
A closer identification is sought with Abhira, a people dwelling
at the mouth of the Indus. Supara, an ancient city on the west
coast of India near modern Goa is also suggested.
<P>
Some believe the name denotes a vague extension eastward, perhaps
as far as China.
<P>
<B>AFRICA</B> 
<P>
This region of the globe is the greatest gold producing region
of the three. Sofala, a seaport near Mozambique on the east coast
of Africa, has been advanced as the site of Ophir, both on linguistic
grounds and from the nature of its products, for there all the
articles of 1 Kings 10:22 could be procured. But Gesenius shows
that Sofala is merely the Arabic form of the Hebrew Shephelah.
Interest in this region as the land of Ophir was renewed, however
by Mauch's discover at Zimbabwe of great ruins and signs of old
Phoenician civilization and worked-out gold mines. According to
Bruce (I, 440), a voyage from Sofala to Ezion-geber would have
occupied three years because of the monsoons.
<P>
<B>ARABIA</B> 
<P>
The claim of Southeastern Arabia as the land of Ophir has on the
whole more to support it than that of India or Africa. The Ophir
region of Genesis 10:29 beyond doubt belonged to this region and
the search for Ophir in more distant lands can be made only on
the precarious assumption that the Ophir of Kings is not the same
as the Ophir of Genesis. Of the various products mentioned, the
only one which from the OT notices can be regarded as clearly
native to Ophir is the gold, and according to Pliny and Strabo,
the region of Southeastern Arabia bordering on the Persian Gulf
was a famous gold-producing country. The other wares were not
necessarily produced in Ophir, but were probably brought there
from more distant lands and from there conveyed by Solomon's merchant
men to Ezion-geber. If the duration of the voyage (three years)
be used as evidence, it favors this location of Ophir as much
as that on the east coast of Africa. It seems therefore the least
assailable view that Ophir was a district on the Persian Gulf
in Southeastern Arabia and served in ancient times as an emporium
of trade between East and West.
<P>
Havilah = both the son of Cush (Gen. 10:7 and the son of Joctan
Gen. 10:29. He is mentioned with Shur as one of the limits of
the territory of the Ishmaelites (Gen. 25:18); cf. the same limits
of the land of the Amalekites (1 Sam. 15:7) where, however, the
text is doubtful. It is described in Gen. 2:11 and 12 as bounded
by the river Pishon and as being rich in gold, bdellium and &quot;shoham-stone&quot;.
The shoham-stone was perhaps the Assyrian samtu, probably the
malachite or turquoise. The mention of a Cushite Havilah is explained
by the fact that the Arabian tribes at an early time migrated
to the coast of Africa. The context of Gen. 10:7 thus favors a
situation on the Ethiopian shore and the name is perhaps preserved
in the kiopos Aualites and in the tribe Abalitani on the southern
side of the straits of Bab-el-Mandeb. Or possibly a trace of the
name appears in the classical Aualis, now Zeila` in Somalia. But
its occurrence among the Yoktanite Arabs (Gen. 10:29) suggests
a location in Arabia. South Arabian inscriptions mention a district
of Khaulan (Haulan) and a place of this name is found both in
Tihama and southeast of San`a'. Again Strabo's <I>Chaulotaioi</I>
and <I>Huwaila</I> in Bahrein point to a district on the Arabian
shores of the Persian Gulf.
<P>
Jobab = in Gen. 36:33-34 and 1 Chron. 1:44-45 the name is used
in reference to an Edomite king. In Josh. 11:1 it refers to the
King of Madon (Madon is a royal city of the Canaanites named along
with Hazor of Galilee. El-Medineh, &quot;the City&quot; on the
heights west of the Sea of Galilee, with which it might be identified,
dates only from Moslem times. It seems likely that the common
confusion of the Hebrew daleth for resh has occurred and that
we should read Maron. The place may then be identified with Meiron,
a village with ancient ruins and rock tombs at the foot of Jebel
Jermuk, a little to the northwest of Safed.

<B>How Should We Understand the Genealogies in Genesis?</B> 
<P>
<I>Arguments in favor of a stict chronology:</I> 
<P>
<B>1. It seems the most natural reading of the text.</B> 
<P>
To postulate gaps is to read the text in an unnatural way. The
average reader would have no reason to believe that there were
gaps, or that the text was saying anything other than what it
appears on the surface to be saying.
<P>
<I>Arguments for rejecting Genesis 11 as a strict chronology:</I>

<P>
<B>1. From silence:</B> 
<P>
If the list of names and ages in Genesis 11 has been given to
us for the purpose of constructing a pre-Abrahamic chronology,
it is strange that Moses failed to give the total number of years
from the flood to Abraham.
<P>
The objection raised to this point is that Moses expected the
reader to do his own totaling and therefore did not add unnecessary
words.
<P>
The answer: Moses took nothing for granted in the reader's ability
to add just two numbers in the life of each antediluvian patriarch
(Gen. 5) in order to ascertain their total life-spans. If the
time span of the whole period was one of the important reasons
for giving the genealogy, how simple it would have been to give
the total, as he did in Exodus 12:40 for the time of Israel's
sojourn in Egypt.
<P>
<B>2. Genesis 5 and 11 are perfectly symmetrical in form.</B>

<P>
It is important to deal with a matter of textual criticism here.
In Genesis 11:12-13 the LXX reads a little different than the
MT:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
When Arphaxad had lived 35 years, he became the father of Cainan.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
And after he became the father of Cainan, Arphaxad lived 430 years
and had other sons and daughters.  When Cainan had lived 130 years,
he became the father of Shelah.  And after he became the father
of Shelah, Cainan lived 330 years, and had other sons and daughters.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Compare this with the MT:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
When Arphaxad had lived 35 years, he became the father of Shelah.
And after he became the father of Shelah, Arphaxad lived 403 years
and had other sons and daughters.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Cainan occurs in the LXX of Gen. 10:24, 11:12-13, and 1 Chron.
1:18.  It also occurs in the Book of Jubilees, and in Demetrius
of the 3rd century BC, according to Polyhistor and Theophilus
of Antioch.  It also occurs in Luke 3:36 in all the manuscripts
except for Codex Bezae. 
<P>
The manuscripts without Cainan include all passages of the Hebrew
text (Gen. 10:24; 11:12-13; 1 Chron. 1:18, 24); the Samaritan
Pentateuch; 1 Chron. 1:24 in the LXX; the Targums of Jonathan
and Onkelos; the Syriac Peshitta; and the Latin Vulgate. 
<P>
Because Luke 3:36 has the name Cainan in it, the LXX reading would
seem to be correct and preferable.  Furthermore, it is difficult
to figure out why the LXX would ADD a name, while it is easy to
understand how a name could drop out. <BR>
With the addition of Cainan, the two genealogies in Genesis 5
and 11 are perfectly symmetrical.  In each case, there are ten
patriarchs, with the tenth patriarch having three important sons:
<P>
<B>Genesis 5     Genesis 11</B>
<P>
1. Adam      Shem
<P>
2. Seth      Arphaxad
<P>
3. Enosh      Cainan
<P>
4. Kenan      Shelah 
<P>
5. Mahalalel     Eber
<P>
6. Jared      Peleg
<P>
7. Enoch      Reu
<P>
8. Methuselah     Serug
<P>
9. Lamech     Nahor
<P>
10. Noah      Terah
<P>
    (Shem, Ham, Japheth)    (Abram, Nahor, Haran) 
<P>
This symmetrical arrangement is of great importance in enabling
us to determine one important purpose of these genealogies, because
a study of the closest parallel to this phenomenon in Scripture,
namely, that of the three groups of fourteen names in the first
chapter of Matthew, reveals the purposely symmetrical character
of such an arrangement of names, possibly as an aid to memorization.
 And Matthew's symmetrical arrangement was achieved at the cost
of leaving out several names.
<P>
<B>3. Information is given concerning each patriarch which is
irrelevant to a strict chronology.</B> 
<P>
Genesis 5:6-8 states that:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
When Seth had lived 105 years, he became the father of Enosh.
 And after he became the father of Enosh, Seth lived 807 years
and had other sons and daughters.  Altogether, Seth lived 912
years, and then he died.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
If the purpose of this genealogy was to provide us with a chronology,
all we would need is that &quot;Seth lived 105 years and became
the father of Enosh&quot;. But the additional facts which are
provided concerning each patriarch indicated that the purpose
of these genealogies was to show us how faithfully God guarded
the Messianic line (Gen. 3:14; 9:26) even in ages of universal
apostasy (Gen. 6:1-12; 11:1-9); to impress upon us the vigor and
grandeur of humanity in those old days of the world's prime; to
demonstrate the fulfillment of the curse of Genesis 2:17 by the
melancholy repetition of the phrase &quot;and he died&quot;; to
show by the shorter life spans of post diluvian patriarchs and
by the omission of their total years of life the tightening grip
of the curse upon the human body; and to make &quot;the record
end in terms of the command of 9:1, which was so vitally important
in view of the flood, by omitting the words &quot;and he died&quot;
in the genealogy of Genesis 11. Since, therefore, so many pedagogical
purposes are evident in these two genealogies that have nothing
to do with the actual length of the overall period, it is unnecessary
to press them into a rigid chronological system.
<P>
<B>4. The Post-Flood patriarchs could not have been contemporaries
of Abram</B> 
<P>
If the strict chronology interpretation of Genesis 11 is correct,
all the postdiluvian patriarchs, including Noah, would still have
been living when Abram was fifty years old; three of those who
were born before the  tower of Babel would have actually outlived
Abram; and Eber, the father of Peleg, not only would have outlived
Abram, but would have lived for two years after Jacob arrived
in Mesopotamia to work for Laban. 
<P>
This, on the face of it, seems strange.  Also note Joshua 24:2,
14, 15 that Abraham's fathers, including Terah, were idolaters
when the dwelt &quot;of old time beyond the River&quot;.  The
statements in Joshua would seem to indicate that, if the patriarchs
Noah and Shem were still alive, they had fallen into idolatry
by then. 
<P>
<B>5. The flood would have occurred about 2500 BC.</B> 
<P>
This is unlikely because archaeologically, it is clear that Mesopotamean
and Egyptian civilizations were in full bloom during this period,
and there are no breaks in the records; 2500 BC simply is not
a reasonable or possible date for the flood.
<P>
<B>NOTES ON ANE CHRONOLOGY </B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>Egypt </I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Egyptian historical chronology, which begins approximately 3100
BC, is based on the arrangement of rulers into approximate family
groups, known as dynasties.  These dynasties were used by the
Graeco-Egyptian priest, Manetho, in preparing a history of Egypt
in the early third century BC.  His dynastic lists have survived
only in the abridged versions of the Christian historians, Africanus
(early third century AD), Eusebius (early fourth century AD) and
a much later compiler known as Syncellus (c. AD 800).  Other parts
of Manetho's history are preserved in the work of Josephus (first
century AD). For convenience, these dynasties have been grouped
into blocks:

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
It is during these periods that the overlapping of dynasties provides
particular chronological difficulties and it may turn out that
they were shorter than is at present assumed. 
<P>
Virtually nothing has survived of the ancient sources available
to Manetho.  Only two documents, the &quot;Royal Canon&quot; of
Turin compiled in the reign of Ramses II (c. 1290-1223 BC) and
the much earlier &quot;Palermo Stone&quot; with related fragments
inscribed during the V Dynasty (c. 2490-2340 BC), illustrate the
kind of ancient annals he might have used.  Three other lists,
of kings' names only, inscribed on monuments at Abydos, Saqqara
and Karnak during the New Kingdom (c. 1567-1085 BC) , though selective,
provide valuable comparative evidence.   These may be supplemented
in some cases by contemporary historical records, by biographical
inscriptions, and by literary works with relevant historical information.
 These lists of king's names in the order of their succession
provide only a relative chronology.  The establishment of an absolute
chronology in regnal years is a complex process.  Although some
ancient records give the length of reigns, the uneven character
of the surviving evidence and the possibility of partly contemporaneous,
rather than consecutive, dynasties, means that dates before about
1550 BC may only be approximate, and even thereafter there may
be a margin of decades in certain cases.  Astronomical observations
provide crucial, if isolated, fixed points. 
<P>
The Egyptian Civil Calendar (they also used two lunar religious
ones) consisted of 12 months of 30 days each, to which were added
five days to complete a 365 day year.  Each period of 12 months
was divided into 3 seasons, the year beginning in the season of
Inundation.  In the ideal year the first day of the year coincided
with the first day on which the dog-star Sirius could be seen
on the eastern horizon just before the rising of the sun (i.e.
it rose helically), about 19 or 20 July in our calendar.  The
Egyptians of the dynastic period never introduced a leap year,
so New Year's Day advanced by a whole day in relation to the natural
year in every period of four years.  Consequently New Year's Day
and the day on which Sirius rose helically coincided for no more
than four years in every period of about 1460 years (4 x 365).
 This is the Sothic Cycle regularly referred to in reference books.

<P>
As it is known from Roman sources that New Year's Day in AD 139
coincided with the rise of Sirius helically it may be calculated
that this had happened previously, in the historic period, in
1322 and 2782 BC, or astronomically more precisely in 1314 and
2770 BC.  Including the Roman record there are seven ancient Egyptian
documents which give Sothic dates, but only two yield results
in terms of regnal years.  These allow us to calculate that the
ninth regnal year of Amenophis I of the XVIII Dynasty was in the
range 1544-1437 BC and that year seven of the earlier Sesostris
III, of the XII dynasty was 1872 BC. (The Illahun papyrus in question
here does not give the name of the pharaoh; but other evidence
from the same archive of papyri indicates Sesotris III.  Calculations
of lunar dates recorded in the same documents help to confirm
the 1872 dating.) Even so, there is a possibility that these so-called
Sothic dates may be 25 years or so too early, if the point of
observation was Thebes and not the region of Memphis-Heliopolis,
further north, as is commonly assumed. 
<P>
Although ancient Egyptian chronology is often referred to as &quot;fixed&quot;,
it will be apparent that this is a relative term.  In so far as
ancient historic chronologies go, before those of Greece and Rome,
it is indeed well-established and for most archaeological purposes
the margins of error are insignificant.  But they most certainly
exist, and not only in the third millennium BC.  Regular minor
modifications in Egyptian historic chronology in the New Kingdom
and later have significant repercussions on the absolute chronology
of Palestine in the time of the Judges and the Monarchy.  Palestinian
chronology at this time, and to a lesser extent, earlier, is fortunate
in having another historic chronology, that of ancient Mesopotamia
(Assyria and Babylonia), with which it may be linked.  Distance
and less intense commercial and diplomatic contact, made relations
between Palestine and Mesopotamia less common than with Egypt.
 But in certain periods, notably in the later Middle Bronze Age
(1750-1550 BC) and during the Assyrian and Babylonian invasions
of Iron Age IIb-c (about 800-580 BC), the association was important.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>Mesopotamian historic chronology </I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The foundations of modern knowledge of Mesopotamian absolute chronology
were laid by a Greek astronomer Ptolemy, living in Alexandria
in Egypt in the second century AD.  In his <I>System of Mathematics</I>,
known as the <I>Almagest</I> or &quot;great work&quot;, he tells
us that he had at hand records of lunar eclipses at Babylon back
to the reign of King Nabonassar (c. 747-734 BC).  These included
an eclipse about 720 BC under a king named in Greek as Mardokempados
(Marduk-apla-iddina = Merodach-Baladan II).  Ptolemy's list of
the kings of Babylon with their regnal years was not included
in the <I>Almagest</I>, but has been preserved in the writings
of the fourth century Alexandrian scholar Theon.  He gives the
regnal years of rulers at Babylon from Nabonassar down to Alexander
the Great and his successors.  Astronomical observations recorded
on baked clay tablets found at Babylon provide evidence for an
independent check on the accuracy of Ptolemy and Theon's absolute
chronology back to the eighth century BC. 
<P>
As certain kings of Assyria also claimed authority over Babylon
at this tie, they appear in Theon's list, allowing it to be correlated
with the much fuller surviving Assyrian King-lists, inscribed
on clay tablets, running back to the fourteenth century BC.  A
solar eclipse recorded for the month of Sivan (May-June) in the
tenth year of the Assyrian King Ashur-Dan II is identified with
the astronomically computed eclipse of 15 June 763 BC.  Before
the fourteenth century BC the margin of error in absolute chronology
in Mesopotamia rises appreciably.  One problem in particular is
critical and must be mentioned here as it is very relevant to
correlations with Palestine in the later Middle Bronze Age.  the
date of the First Dynasty of Babylon, to which the famous King
Hammurabi belonged still floats over a period of at least 120
years. 
<P>
According to current understanding the end of this dynasty might
be either in 1650, 1594, 1586 or 1530 BC.  these intervals are
governed by the primary surviving astronomical evidence.  From
the reign of King Ammisaduqa, the tenth and penultimate ruler
of this dynasty, have survived records of the first and last visibility
of Venus as morning and evening star for 21 years of his reign.
 This king began his reign 52 years before the end of the dynasty.
 The records only survive in late, corrupt copies, but astronomical
calculations have corrected them where necessary. (A recent critical
edition of these texts suggests that they are so corrupt a record
as to be of very little use as the base for chronological calculations).
 The dates of the first and last appearances of Venus in the intercalated
Babylonian lunar calendar virtually repeat every 56 plus or minus
8 years.  With the help of the Venus Observations, and supplementary
archaeological and historical evidence from a wide variety of
sources, the majority of scholars have increasingly come to accept
the &quot;Middle Chronology&quot;, ending the First Dynasty of
Babylon about 1595 BC and thereby dating Hammurabi c. 1792-1750
BC.  This is the system adopted for the revised Cambridge Ancient
History.  Students of Palestinian archaeology need to be aware
that Albright always argued for a lower chronology which sets
the end of the dynasty at about 1530 BC.  As documents from the
great palace at Mari on the Euphrates in modern Syria reveal that
Hammurabi was a contemporary of King Shamshi-Adad I of Assyria,
the records of Assyria and Babylonia may thereby be linked. <BR>
King lists, year-names and occasional synchronisms allow for a
plausible reconstruction of absolute chronology back another five
hundred years or so from the beginning of the First Dynasty, on
the Middle Chronology about 1890 BC to the time of the earliest
kings in south Mesopotamia (Sumer) for whom contemporary inscriptions
have survived.  A crucial source in this reconstruction is an
inscribed baked clay prism, named after its first modern owner
Weld-Blundell, giving the best surviving copy of the Sumerian
King-list.  This remarkable document extends back to the mythological
rulers of Sumer before the Flood and runs down to the seventh
year of King Sinmagir of the city of Isin about 1817 BC.  Use
of such a list in reconstructing absolute chronologies is hampered
by the recording in succession of dynasties that certainly overlapped
and the inflated lengths give to the reigns of some rulers.  the
compilers were more interested in the sequence of events than
in the intervals between them.  Thus in Sumer, as in Egypt, it
is the third Millennium BC that modern scientific aids for establishing
absolute chronologies are as vital to the text-aided archaeologist
as they are at all times to his text-free colleagues.  Carbon
14 dating is still undoubtedly the most important of these for
any but the more remote prehistoric periods.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>Carbon 14 Dating </I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
About 1946 Professor W.F. Libby of Chicago University discovered
an aging process inherent in organic materials, outstandingly
for archaeology, charcoal and bone, that within certain limits
makes it possible to determine the age of samples in years.  All
living matter contains a small but practically constant proportion
of the radioactive isotope of carbon, Carbon 14 (C14).  This is
produced by cosmic-ray bombardment of nitrogen atoms in the outer
atmosphere.  When an animal or plant dies the radioactive carbon
in its tissue ceases to be replenished from the atmosphere.  Indeed
it disintegrates at a constant rate.  After a certain length of
time half will have disintegrated radioactively and half will
be left in the original radioactive form.  This time interval
is known as the &quot;half-life&quot; originally determined for
radiocarbon (Carbon 14) as 5568 (plus or minus 30) years.  Thus,
if measurement of the radioactivity of a sample may be set at
two half-lifes or about 11,150 years BP (Before the Present).

<P>
All radiocarbon dates are published with a plus or minus figure,
1525 plus or minus 75 BC.  This often leads to confusion since
it expresses a statistical concept.  It does not mean that the
statistical uncertainty (commonly referred to as the &quot;error&quot;)
is precisely the amount quoted, nor that the proper reading must
necessarily be within the limits apparently set.  It indicates
that the best estimate for the correct value is 1525 BC with a
&quot;standard deviation&quot; of seventy-five years.  This means
more specifically that the correct value has a 66% probability
of lying within the limits of two standard deviations, i.e. 1525
+ 150 to 1525 - 150 BC, and a 99.5% probability of lying within
three standard deviations.  It will be immediately clear that
this method is not likely to provide fundamental information for
a Palestinian archaeological context where the Egyptian historical
chronology may be applied. 
<P>
Two of the assumptions underlying Libby's development of radiocarbon
dating require further comment.  First, it was assumed that Carbon
14 has a single, fixed half-life.  This view still stands, although
laboratory measurement of it has been refined in recent years.
 The best available estimate of the half-life is now set at 5730
plus or minus 30 years, about 3.4% longer than the previous value
established by Libby.  Ages calculated on the old 5568 half life
(in years BP, Before Present, conventionally taken as 1950) may
be adjusted through multiplication by 1.03.  If the figure to
be recalculated is already give in years BC,  the adjustment requires
multiplication of 1.03 and the addition of 66 years.  Clearly,
it is very important when quoting Carbon 14 to make clear which
half-life value has been used.  It has been agreed that dates
should be quoted with the old Libby half-life of 5568 to avoid
confusion.   This should be assumed unless otherwise clearly stated.

<P>
The second of Libby's assumptions, that the proportion of radiocarbon
to ordinary carbon ( the common stable isotope, Carbon 12) has
remained constant through time, has been shown to be erroneous.
 The deviations before about 1000 BC are so great as to make significant
differences in date determinations.  Appreciation of this variation
has led to a major reappraisal of radiocarbon chronologies in
the last couple of decades.  Since the late 1950s radio carbon
determinations radiocarbon determinations of wood from the very
long lived bristle cone pine growing in the White Mountains of
California, dated independently by counting its annual growth
rings, have indicated that the concentration of radiocarbon in
the atmosphere, and thus in living things, has varied considerably.
 It was much higher 6000 years ago than it is now.  Using Libby's
assumption of constancy dates had been determined that were misleadingly
recent.  Libby himself had already seen that something was amiss
when he realized that radiocarbon determinations for Egyptian
samples were consistently too recent by comparison with the local
historical chronology.  It was to become clear that it was the
radiocarbon calendar, not the historical chronology for Egypt,
which was in error. 
<P>
Now, through radiocarbon determinations of tree-ring samples of
known date from the bristle cone pine, graphs have been constructed
which may be used to convert radiocarbon dates, in radiocarbon
years, to true, or tree-ring dates in calendar years BC/AD.  This
calibration process, though still a matter of debate and research,
has become a necessary part of Carbon 14 studies.  All who use
radiocarbon dates need to be aware of it.  It is increasingly
the convention that bc is written when using simple, uncalibrated
radiocarbon dates, and the capitals BC only when the dates are
expressed in calendar years after calibration.  The situation
is made more complex for the non specialist by the existence of
several calibration curves or graphs, each differing slightly
in the results given, since much more information on short term
Carbon 14 fluctuations is still needed in many areas.  It is all
the more important then that any sue of radiocarbon date determinations
should give as many details as possible: what type of material
was samples (charcoal, bone, etc.); what its precise archaeological
context was; what the original radiocarbon date (BP) was, with
its laboratory code number; which half-life and which calibration
curve was used in determining the value in years BC/AD.  
<P>
In using radiocarbon dates amateurs and professionals alike all
too often ignore the fundamental fact that radiocarbon measurements
date the age of the organic tissue of the sample -- the time when
it originated.  It is quite possible that the tissue of a sample
from a specific archaeological context might have been biologically
dead for several decades or even centuries before ancient man
used it, whether in building or for fuel.  A distinction between
potentially young material, say charred grain, and potentially
old material, such as structural timbers, may be crucial.  Single
dates must always be treated with the greatest caution.  As Carbon
14 dating is based on statistical calculations, it is always best
to examine a range of samples from the same context in order to
analyze the spread of dates.  For the present, the importance
of radiocarbon dating for Palestine is concentrated on the prehistoric
periods and the third millennium BC, where the independent historic
chronologies are either unavailable or known to be fallible. 
In a careful review of all the Carbon 14 dates available up to
1976 for the Palestinian Early Bronze Age, Callaway and Weinstein
were able to show that they indicated a higher chronology for
the beginning of the period (c. 3300 BC) than Albright and other
Palestinian archaeologists had previously argued.  This was found
to be consonant with the latest information available through
controlled stratigraphic excavation. 
<P>
In summary, chronology in Palestine rests on three largely independent
foundations: Egyptian chronology, Mesopotamian chronology and
Radiocarbon dating.  By careful correlation of the relative sequence
of levels on each excavated site a composite picture is built
up for a specific period across Palestine.
<P>
Then foreign synchronisms are established, if possible through
inscriptions, if not through imported seals, pottery or other
small objects, which link levels on Palestinian sites to the absolute
historic chronologies of Egypt or Mesopotamia.  In the example
given above, for example, there is a broad correlation between
Early Bronze II in Palestine and the Pharaohs of Egypt from Djer,
the third ruler of the First Dynasty, to Khasekhem, penultimate
ruler of the Second Dynasty.  Their dates may be established through
Egyptian records, as indicated above (I-VI Dynasty, c. 3100-2181
BC), and then correlated as appropriate with Carbon 14 datings.
