          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On Saturdays from 4:00 - 6:00 PM (U.S. Pacific Time) 
          the faculty and students of <A HREF="/">Quartz Hill School 
            of Theology</A> once offered a weekly discussion format Internet Radio 
          broadcast called <i>Beyond the Box</i>. The broadcast was conducted live, 
          hosted by <a href="http://www.qnet.com" target="NEW">Quantum Networking 
            Solutions, Inc. (QNet)</a> as part of their experiment in Internet Radio. 
          They ultimately decided not to continue online broadcasting and so that was the 
          end of our show.<br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The participants in the broadcast included faculty 
          and students of <A HREF="/">Quartz Hill School of Theology</A>. 
          Listeners were able to participate by email and through an 800 number. It was a 
          lot of fun for us.<br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Theology is not a finished set of dogmatic 
        propositions. Rather, theology is a wide open field of endeavor. God is not 
        tame; he does not easily fit into a set of propositions, a simple equation, a 
        small or large box. Solomon, as he contemplated the temple he had built, 
        stated: "But will God really dwell on earth? The heavens, even the highest 
        heaven, cannot contain you. How much less this temple I have built!" (1 Kings 
        8:27; parallel account 1 Chronicles 6:18). Metaphorically, we might argue the 
        same. God is infinite and we are finite, thus, we can only comprehend a finite 
        portion of him. There are more questions than answers in the field of theology. 
        Our job on this program (like the theology courses at Quartz Hill School of 
        Theology), was more to ask these endless questions, than to give settled 
        answers.
