<B>The Book of Micah</B> 
<P>
<B>I. Title</B> 
<P>
The title of the book is the same in Hebrew as it is in the English
and Greek translations. The name Micah means &quot;who is like
Yahweh?&quot;
<P>
<B>II. Author and Setting</B> 
<P>
Micah was from Moresheth, about twenty miles southwest of Jerusalem
on the Philistine border, in Judah. He prophesied to both Jerusalem
and Samaria, though his principle ministry was to the Southern
Kingdom. His prophesy was remembered and respected in the days
of Jeremiah, and his words convinced the king not to put Jeremiah
to death (Jeremiah 26:18-19).
<P>
His prophesies were spoken during the reigns of Jotham, Ahaz,
and Hezekiah, placing his dates then between about 740 and 695
BC. Contemporaries of Micah were Isaiah in the south and Hosea
in the north. See 2 Kings 15:8-21:18 for further information on
the events of this period.
