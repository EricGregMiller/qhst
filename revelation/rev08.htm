<BLOCKQUOTE>1. And when he opened the seventh seal, there followed a silence in heaven about the space of half an hour. <P>
2  And I saw the seven angels that stand before God; and there were given unto them seven trumpets.</BLOCKQUOTE> <P>

The idea of 7 angels standing before God is an ancient Jewish idea.  The names are Raphael, Uriel, Raguel, Michael, Sariel, Gabriel, and  Remiel. <P> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>3  And another angel came and stood over the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given unto him much incense, that he should add it unto the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne.</BLOCKQUOTE> <P>

cf. Ps 141:2 on the idea that prayers are like incense before God.<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>4  And the smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, went up before God out of the angel's hand. </BLOCKQUOTE>   <P>

It is Michael who presents the prayers of the saints to God.  <P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>5  And the angel taketh the censer; and he filled it with the fire of the altar, and cast it upon the earth: and there followed thunders, and voices, and lightnings, and an earthquake. <P>
6  And the seven angels that had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound. <P>
7. And the first sounded, and there followed hail and fire, mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth: and the third part of the earth was burnt up, and the third part of the trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up. </BLOCKQUOTE><P>

Cf. Ex 9:24 on this mixing of incense and  coals from the altar.  <P>
The one third of the earth burnt is evidence of the corruption of the dwellers of the earth, who are brought into judgement.  <P>
  
<BLOCKQUOTE>8  And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea: and the third part of the sea became blood; <P>
9  and there died the third part of the creatures which were in the sea, even they that had life; and the third part of the ships was destroyed. <P>
10  And the third angel sounded, and there fell from heaven a great star, burning as a torch, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of the waters; </BLOCKQUOTE><P>

The judgement continues.<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>11  and the name of the star is called Wormwood: and the third part of the waters became wormwood; and many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter. <P>
12  And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars; that the third part of them should be darkened, and the day should not shine for the third part of it, and the night in like manner.</BLOCKQUOTE> <P>

The darkness thereby brought about is reflective of the darkness which is found among humanity.  <P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>13  And I saw, and  I heard an eagle, flying through mid heaven, saying with a great voice, Woe, woe, woe, for them that dwell on the earth, by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels, who are yet to sound. </BLOCKQUOTE><P>
