A definition of The Trinity runs as follows: there is only one
God; the Father is God, the Son is God, the Holy Spirit is God
and yet there are not three Gods but only one. The persons are
co-eternal and co-equal; one substance makes up the three members
of the Godhead, yet it exists or is distributed among three persons.
All alike are uncreated and omnipotent. God is a triune being,
three persons in one.
<P>
The technical definition of The Trinity may perhaps be confusing
to some people. As a result, various devices have been developed
to try to make the concept understandable. Here are a few.
<P>
One can picture a cake, made up of its separate ingredients: eggs,
flour, sugar -- yet combined and cooked, they make a single cake.
A single bottle of soft drink may be poured out into three glasses
-- one substance, yet three containers. St. Patrick liked to make
use of the Shamrock as an illustration of the Trinity: three leaves,
yet one Shamrock. Water exists in three forms: liquid, solid (ice),
and gas (water vapor), yet it remains one substance.
<P>
Perhaps the best way of expressing the nature of the Trinity is
to take the approach used in the Bible: that of a family. Three
members belong to this family: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, yet
they remain a single family, identified by the term God. No analogy,
no example to help explain the nature of the trinity is going
to be without its flaws. Every analogy breaks down, every example
remains less than completely satisfying. It must be understood
that the doctrine of The Trinity is designed to remove the paradox
that, though the Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Spirit
is God, yet there is but <I>one</I> God.

<P>
The Greek grammatical construction leaves no doubt whatsoever
that this is the only possible rendering of the text. The subject
of the sentence is Word (<I>logos</I>), the verb was. There can
be no direct object following was, since according to grammatical
usage, intransitive verbs take no objects but take instead predicate
nominative which refer back to the subject, in this case, word
(<I>logos</I>) it is therefore easy to see that no article is
needed for theos (God), and to translate it &quot;a god&quot;
is both incorrect grammar and poor Greek, since theos is the predicative
nominative of was in the third sentence-clause of the verse and
must refer back to the subject word (<I>logos</I>) Christ then,
if he is the word &quot;made flesh&quot; (Jn 1:14) can be no one
else except God, unless the Greek text and consequently God's
word be denied.&quot; &quot;The Word was with God&quot; means
that the Word was with the person commonly known as &quot;God&quot;,
that is, the Father -- while &quot;the Word was God&quot; means
that the Word was himself God by nature as much God as the Father,
without being the same person as the Father. This is about as
explicit as it gets. Besides the problems in Greek with those
who would suggest that the verse should be translated &quot;the
word was a god&quot;, such a translation seriously contradicts
the Scriptures which say there is no other God but the one true
God.
<P>
If Jesus is &quot;a god&quot; then what else can he be but God?
There is only one divine being in the universe. All others are
either false gods, who are not gods at all, or humans who falsely
claim such divinity (as for instance certain kings). That Satan
is referred to as &quot;the God of this age&quot; can hardly be
construed as an argument against Jesus' divinity. The statement
in reference to Satan is sarcastic, not serious; he is worshiped
by the wicked, and they follow him instead of the true God. Satan
is portrayed as a false god. This is hardly equivalent to the
way Jesus is portrayed. Notice what Paul says in 1 Corinthians
8:4-6:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
So then, about eating food sacrificed to idols: We know that an
idol is nothing at all in the world and that there is no God but
one. For even if there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or
on earth (as indeed there are many &quot;gods&quot; and many &quot;lords&quot;),
yet for us there is but one God, the Father, from whom all things
came and for whom we live; and there is but one Lord, Jesus Christ,
through whom all things came and through whom we live.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
According to 1 Corinthians, if the Word in John 1:1 is anything
other than the one true God -- simply &quot;a god&quot; -- then
he is false and evil. The Watchtower publication, <I>Reasoning
from Scripture </I>points out that &quot;Isaiah 9:6 (RS) also
prophetically describes Jesus as 'Mighty God,' but not as the
Almighty God. All this is in harmony with Jesus' being described
as 'a god,' or 'divine,' at John 1:1 (NW,AT).&quot; Yet the point
being made by the Watchtower publication seems ill-founded at
best, because just one chapter over in Isaiah 10:20-21 is the
following:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;In that day the remnant of Israel, the survivors of the
house of Jacob,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
will no longer rely on him who struck them down
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
but will truly rely on Yahweh,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
the Holy One of Israel.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
A remnant will return,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
a remnant of Jacob will return to the Mighty God.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
If Yahweh is referred to as &quot;Mighty God&quot; wouldn't it
be somewhat blasphemous to apply the same designation to anyone
of lesser significance? In some Jehovah's Witness literature it
is intimated that there are three classes of divine beings: The
one true God, false gods, and something in between, &quot;creatures
which, by virtue of their might and authority over other creatures
are legitimately designated 'gods'.&quot; How a creature could
be neither the True God, when the Bible is unmistakable in declaring
there is only one, nor a false god who is not legitimate at all
-- and yet still be &quot;a god&quot;, is puzzling to say the
least. Scriptures raised to suggest that someone else might legitimately
be referred to as &quot;a god&quot; are Psalm 82:1, 6 (compared
to John 10:34); Psalm 8:5 (compare to Hebrews 2:7); and sometimes
Exodus 22:8-9, 28. In Psalm 82:1, 6 the psalmist calls certain
rulers &quot;gods&quot; (Hebrew <I>elohim</I>), yet verse five
states that they will die, making clear the writer's sarcastic
use of the term &quot;god&quot; for these kings (see the similar
approach taken by the writer of Ezekiel 28:1-10, where, regarding
the ruler of Tyre, he records:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Son of man, say to the ruler of Tyre,

<P>
In Hebrew, Psalm 8:5 states that man was created &quot;a little
lower than God.&quot; The writer of Hebrews 2:7 was not quoting
from this Hebrew text when he wrote his passage; instead he made
use of the Greek translation of the Old Testament which has here
&quot;angels&quot; in place of God. The Jewish people during the
time the Septuagint was written were very fearful of doing anything
to lessen the power and glory of God; therefore, they substituted
&quot;bless&quot; in place of &quot;curse&quot; when the object
of cursing was God, and adjusted other passages which might be
taken to lessen God's honor -- hence their translation of Psalm
8:5. The use of this Greek translation by the writer of Hebrews
should not be taken as an endorsement of the idea that &quot;God&quot;
sometimes refers to someone other than the one true God. So far
as Exodus 22:8-9 and 28 are concerned, in Hebrew it is clearly
the word &quot;God&quot; (<I>Elohim</I>) and though certain translations
may want to make this word mean &quot;judges,&quot; there is no
evidence to suggest that this is reasonable; there are no other
places in the Bible where such a translation of the term could
at all be justified, and to take it as meaning &quot;God&quot;
in Exodus makes perfect sense. Finally, it may be useful to quote
at least a portion of a letter written by Julius R. Mantey, whose
<I>Manual Grammar of the Greek New Testament</I> has been quoted
by various Watchtower publications in their discussions of John
1:1-2:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I have a copy of your letter addressed to Caris in Santa Ana,
California and I am writing to express my disagreement with statements
made in that letter, as well as in quotations you have made from
The Dana-Mantey Greek Grammar.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
1) Your statement: &quot;their work allows for the rendering found
in the <I>Kingdom Interlinear Translation of the Greek Scriptures</I>
at John 1:1.&quot; There is no statement in our grammar that was
ever meant to imply that &quot;a god&quot; was a permissible translation
in John 1:1. A. We had no &quot;rule&quot; to argue in support
of the trinity. B. Neither did we state that we did have such
intention. We were simply delineating the facts inherent in Biblical
language. C. Your quotation from P. 148(3) was in a paragraph
under the heading: &quot;With the Subject in a Copulative Sentence.&quot;
Two examples occur here to illustrate that &quot;the article points
out the subject in these examples.&quot; But we made no statement
in this paragraph about the predicate except that, &quot;as it
stands the other persons of the trinity may be implied in <I>theos.</I>&quot;
And isn't that the opposite of what your translation &quot;a god&quot;
infers? You quoted me out of context. On pages 139 and 140 (VI)
in our grammar we stated: &quot;without the article <I>theos</I>
signifies divine essence...<I>theos en ho logos</I> emphasizes
Christ's participation in the essence of the divine nature.&quot;
Our interpretation is in agreement with that in NEB and the TED:
&quot;What God was, the Word was&quot;; and with that of Barclay:
&quot;The nature of the Word was the same as the nature of God,&quot;
which you quoted in your letter to Caris.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
2) Since Colwell's and Harner's article in JBL, especially that
of Harner, it is neither scholarly nor reasonable to translate
John 1:1 &quot;The Word was a god.&quot; Word-order has made obsolete
and incorrect such a rendering.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
3) Your quotation of Colwell's rule is inadequate because it quotes
only a part of his findings. You did not quote this strong assertion:
&quot;A predicate nominative which precedes the verb cannot be
translated as an indefinite or a 'qualitative' noun solely because
of the absence of the article.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
4) Prof. Harner, Vol. 92:1 (1973) in JBL, has gone beyond Colwell's
research and has discovered that anarthrous predicate nouns preceding
the verb function primarily to express the nature or character
of the subject. He found this true in 53 passages in the Gospel
of John and 8 in the Gospel of Mark. Both scholars wrote that
when indefiniteness was intended that gospel writers regularly
placed the predicate noun after the verb, and both Colwell and
Harner have stated that <I>theos</I> in John 1:1 is not indefinite
and should not be translated &quot;a god&quot;. Watchtower writers
appear to be the only ones advocating such a translation now.
The evidence appears to be 99% against them.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
5) Your statement in your letter that the sacred text itself should
guide one and &quot;not just someone's rule book.&quot; We agree
with you. But our study proves that Jehovah's Witnesses do the
opposite of that whenever the &quot;sacred text&quot; differs
with their heretical beliefs. For example the translation of <I>kolasis</I>
as cutting off when punishment is the only meaning cited in the
lexicons for it. The mistranslation of <I>ego eimi</I> as &quot;I
have been&quot; in John 8:58. The addition of &quot;for all time&quot;
in Hebrews 9:27 when nothing in the Greek New Testament supports
it.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The attempt to belittle Christ by mistranslating <I>arche tes
ktiseos</I> &quot;beginning of the creation&quot; when he is magnified
as &quot;the creator of all things&quot; (John 1:2) and as &quot;equal
with God&quot; (Phil. 2:6) before he humble himself and lived
in a human body here on earth. Your quotation of &quot;The father
is greater than I am&quot; (John 14:28) to prove that Jesus was
not equal to God overlooks the fact stated in Phil. 2:6-8. When
Jesus said that, he was still in his voluntary state of humiliation.
That state ended when he ascended to heaven. Why the attempt to
deliberately deceive people by mispunctuation by placing a comma
after &quot;today&quot; in Luke 23:43 when in the Greek, Latin,
German and all English translations except yours, even in the
Greek in your <I>KIT</I>, the comma occurs after <I>lego</I> (I
say) -- &quot;Today you will be with me in Paradise.&quot; 2 Cor.
5:8, &quot;to be out of the body and at home with the Lord.&quot;
These passages teach that the redeemed go immediately to heaven
after death, which does not agree with your teachings that death
ends all life until the resurrection. Cf. Ps. 23:6 and Heb. 1:10.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The aforementioned are only a few examples of Watchtower mistranslations
and perversions of God's Word. In view of the preceding facts,
especially because you have been quoting me out of context, I

The Greek word translated &quot;form&quot; in both verses is <I>morphe;</I>
in the same way Christ had the &quot;form&quot; of God, so he
had the &quot;form&quot; of a man. The use of the term <I>morphe</I>
in scripture is quite interesting. Gifferd writes that,
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>...morphe</I> is therefore properly the nature or essence,
not in the abstract, but as actually subsisting in the individual,
and retained as long as the individual itself exits....Thus in
the passage before us <I>morphe Theou</I> is the Divine nature
actually and inseparably subsisting in the Person of Christ....For
the interpretation of 'the form of God' it is sufficient to say
that (1) it includes the whole nature and essence of Deity, and
is inseparable from them, since they could have no actual existence
without it; and (2) that it does not include in itself anything
'accidental' or separable, such as particular modes of manifestation,
or conditions of glory and majesty, which may at one time be attached
to the 'form,' at another separated from it...
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The true meaning of <I>morphe</I> in the expression 'form of God'
is confirmed by its recurrence in the corresponding phrase, 'form
of a servant.' It is universally admitted that the two phrases
are directly antithetical, and that 'form' must therefore have
the same sense in both&quot;. It is perhaps interesting to note
that the Septuagint makes use of the term <I>morphe</I> in such
passages as Judges 8:18, where it describes Gideon's brothers
as having the &quot;form&quot; of princes. Or in Isaiah 44:13
where the craftsman is described as making idols in the &quot;form&quot;
of a man. As this passage in Philippians makes clear, as much
as Jesus was human, so was he God.

<P>
Everett F. Harrison writing about this passage in his commentary
on Romans states:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
But is &quot;God over all&quot; the correct translation? On the
ground that elsewhere Paul avoids such a stark identification,
despite his high Christology, some scholars reject the traditional
rendering, preferring something on the order of NEB: &quot;May
God, supreme above all, be blessed for ever.&quot; This involves
taking the closing portion of the verse as a doxology and referring
it to God (the Father). Several considerations favor the traditional
wording, which refers &quot;God&quot; to Christ: (1) Christ's
relationship to Israel on the human side has been stated in such
a way as to call for a complementary statement on the divine side.
This is provided by the usual translation but not by the other
rendering. (2) &quot;Who&quot; can properly be coupled only with
the foregoing subject (Christ). If another subject (God) is being
introduced, there is no reason at all for the &quot;who.&quot;
(3) A doxology to God can hardly be intended, since in doxologies
the word &quot;blessed&quot; is regularly placed before the one
who is praised. Here it comes after. (4) A doxology to God would
be singularly out of place in a passage marked by sorrow over
Israel's failure to recognize in Christ her crowning spiritual
blessing. (5) The definite article &quot;the,&quot; is not linked
in the text with &quot;God,&quot; but with the foregoing words
(literally, &quot;the one being over all&quot;), so Paul is not
trying to displace God with Christ, but is doing what John does
in Saying that the Word was God (John 1:1), that is, has the rank
of God. In any case, this is really implied in recognizing him
as &quot;over all&quot; (it is very awkward, with NEB, to refer
this to God in distinction from Christ). (Frank E. Gaebelein,

Commenting on this passage, even the Watchtower publication, <I>Reasoning
From Scripture,</I> states (on page 213) that &quot;There is no
objection to referring to Jesus as 'God', if this is what Thomas
had in mind.&quot; Admittedly the book then goes on and tries
to limit the impact of this statement by arguing that since mighty
men were referred to as &quot;gods&quot;, then there is nothing
wrong in describing Jesus as &quot;divine&quot; or &quot;a god&quot;.
This argument has already been discussed in some detail above.
But this brings up another issue that needs to be faced. The Watchtower
publications will make use of terms such as &quot;deity&quot;,
&quot;divine&quot;, &quot;divinity&quot; and leave the impression
that it is okay to apply such terms to Jesus since they are somehow
less strong than saying &quot;Jesus is God&quot;. However, the
word &quot;deity&quot; means &quot;God&quot;, as do the words
&quot;divine&quot; and &quot;divinity&quot;. Those translations
that use such terms in reference to the Son are not thereby trying
to downplay the fact that Jesus is God. Instead they are affirming
it!

<P>
There is really not a whole lot that can be argued against this
rendering; even the rendering in NW approximates this. Reasoning
from Scripture tries to say that the above translation is inconsistent:
&quot;they [translators] do not follow the same rule in their
translation of 2 Thessalonians 1:12&quot;. Unfortunately for this
statement, the structure in the two passages is not the same:

<P>
Considering the difference in structure between these two passages,
it is not surprising that 2 Thes. 1:12 tends to be translated
differently than Titus 2:13. Therefore, it is inescapable that
Titus 2:13 states plainly that Jesus Christ is &quot;our Great
God and Savior&quot;. And notice in Greek that it is &quot;THE
Great God&quot; -- with a definite article.

<P>
The criticism raised against Trinitarians who use this verse to
show that Jesus is God is that &quot;Being truly 'divinity,' or
of 'divine nature' does not make Jesus as the Son of God coequal
and coeternal with the Father, any more than the fact that all
humans share 'humanity' or 'human nature' makes them coequal or
all the same age.&quot;
<P>
What are they saying then? That as there are many human beings,
so there are many Gods? This is an argument for polytheism, not
an argument countering the Trinity, which preserves the Biblical
truth of &quot;Hear O Israel, Yahweh our God, Yahweh is one&quot;.
If a man is &quot;human&quot; and shares in &quot;humanity&quot;,
then how much less is the Son of God &quot;divine&quot; and sharing
in &quot;divinity&quot;? There is only one God; if Jesus is &quot;divine&quot;
then he has to be God. There is not room for more than one God!

<P>
It is difficult to escape the feeling of omnipotence given off
by this passage. Not only is the Son of God responsible for creating
the universe, it is also by his power that everything remains
in its orderly pattern. Related to this concept, one might also
take a look at the next passage and the comments that follow.

explicit statement of omnipresence is found, though it well reflects

Only God is portrayed in the Bible as being everywhere present,
of being all powerful, and having all knowledge. Yet, the Son
is given these same attributes. Is it so surprising then that
Colossians 2:9 states that &quot;For in Christ all the fullness
of the Deity lives in bodily form...&quot;
<P>
Some might object: &quot;But look, the next verse goes on to add
&quot;and you have been given fullness in Christ, who is the head
over every power and authority.&quot; So does this mean that we
are Christ, if his fullness dwells in us? Not quite; take a look
at Galatians 2:20ff. to get a sense of what Paul means:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ
lives in me. The life I live in the body, I live by faith in the
Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me. I do not set
aside the grace of God, for if righteousness could be gained through
the law, Christ died for nothing!
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Christ living in us, the Holy Spirit living in us, is the evidence
of salvation; what it is to be a Christian. It has nothing to
do with making us &quot;gods&quot; or &quot;christs&quot;.
<P>
One last passage on the subject, Romans 8:1-2:

Sometimes Jesus refers to the Father as God and this is taken
as an indication that Jesus is somehow less than God. For instance,
in John 20:17:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Jesus said, &quot;Do not hold on to me, for I have not yet returned
to my Father. Go instead to my brothers and tell them, 'I am returning
to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.'&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
There is nothing odd in Jesus referring to the Father as God,
since indeed that is what the Father is. What else would Jesus
call Him? In his incarnation as a human being, this would not
be unexpected -- but even in his glorified state (as in Revelation
3:12) there is nothing odd in it. Moreover it should be noted
that in John 20 for Jesus the words &quot;Father&quot; and &quot;God&quot;
are equivalent terms, defining each other.
<P>
Some will take Jesus' words in John 17:1-3 and say that Jesus
has excluded himself from being God:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
After Jesus said this, he looked toward heaven and prayed: &quot;Father,
the time has come. Glorify your Son, that your Son may glorify
you. For you granted him authority over all people that he might
give eternal life to all those you have given him. Now this is
eternal life: that they may know you, the only true God, and Jesus
Christ, whom you have sent.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Perhaps it would be useful to read verses four and five as well:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I have brought you glory on earth by completing the work you gave
me to do. And now, Father, glorify me in your presence with the
glory I had with you before the world began.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Listing Jesus separate from the Father does not diminish his Godhood;
it merely distinguishes the members of the Trinity as the separate
persons that they are.
<P>
It should be noticed that the words of Hebrews 1:10-12 are addressed
to the Son, paralleling John 17:4-5:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
He [God] also says: (about the son, see verse eight)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Now some might say this passage is applied to the Son simply because
he is God's representative and does the will of the Father. However,
the angels are God's representatives and do God's will, yet the
whole argument in the passage in Hebrews is that the Son is something
far more than the angels. As Hebrews 1:3-4 states:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The Son is the radiance of God's glory and the exact representation
of his being, sustaining all things by his powerful word. After
he had provided purification for sins, he sat down at the right
hand of the Majesty in heaven. So he became as much superior to
the angels as the name he has inherited is superior to theirs.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Paul was an apostle of Jesus Christ, an ambassador of God; the
same could be said of Peter and the other apostles or of the Kings
of Israel and Judah, and yet no passages apply divinity to any
of these other &quot;representatives&quot; of God. Jesus is far
more than a mere &quot;representative&quot; -- which is the whole
point of Hebrews chapter one!

These are key verses, since they tell us no one has seen God.
Yet, we know from the Old Testament that people <I>did</I> see
God. For instance, Exodus 24:9-11:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;Moses and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and the seventy elders
of Israel went up and saw the God of Israel.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Under his feet was something like a pavement made of sapphire,
clear as the sky itself. But God did not raise his hand against
these leaders of the Israelites; they saw God, and they ate and
drank.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The Hebrew word <I>hazah</I> translated as &quot;see&quot; in
24:11 means &quot;to see or behold with the eyes&quot;, according
to Brown, Driver, and Briggs in their <I>Hebrew and English Lexicon,</I>
where they make specific mention of this very verse.
<P>
Notice also Genesis 18, where Abraham has three visitors, one
of whom turns out to be the Lord: Yahweh. See also Isaiah 6:1-3
where Isaiah saw God &quot;high and lifted up&quot; in the same
way he saw the Seraphim; Numbers 12:6-8 tells us that Moses spoke
to God face to face, rather than through visions or dreams, and
that he sees &quot;the form of God&quot;; Judges 13:20-23 explains
that the father of Samson is afraid he might die because he has
seen God. He is reassured by his wife when she points out that
God would not have accepted their offering if he intended to kill
them. Job 42:5 says that Job saw God.
<P>
To explain the apparent contradiction between John 1:18 and 6:46,
which very clearly state that no one has seen God -- and Exodus
24 which very clearly says that Moses and seventy-three other
folks did (not to mention the problems raised by the other passages),
there is only one possible explanation: since no one has seen
the Father, the only conclusion, then, is that the God of the
Old Testament, Yahweh, is none other than the Son of God! This
isn't so surprising considering that Romans 10:9-13 records:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
That if you confess with your mouth, &quot;Jesus is Lord,&quot;
and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you
will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and
are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and
are saved. As the Scripture says, &quot;Everyone who trusts in
him will never be put to shame.&quot; For there is no difference
between Jew and Gentile -- the same Lord is Lord of all and richly
blesses all who call on him, for &quot;Everyone who calls on the
name of the Lord will be saved.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Paul has here quoted from Joel 2:32: &quot;Everyone who calls
on the name of Yahweh will be saved.&quot; Yet Paul applies the
statement to Christ. Consider also Acts 2:21 where the same passage
is quoted from Joel and Peter again applies it to Jesus. Or Acts
4:10-12, where Peter says:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Then know this, you and everyone else in Israel: It is by the
name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified but whom
God raised from the dead, that this man stands before you completely
healed. He is &quot;the stone you builders rejected, which has
become the capstone.&quot; Salvation is found in no one else,
for there is no other name under heaven given to men by which
we must be saved.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Salvation is through the Son, whether in the Old Testament or
the New. Notice also what Isaiah 43:11 says:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I, even I, am Yahweh,

and apart from me there is no savior.

<P>
Not all the Greek manuscripts have the phrase &quot;nor the Son&quot;
(in fact, it is quite a large number, including an uncial text
dating back to the fourth century). But even if the phrase does
stand in the text, it is easily explained by the fact that Jesus
was speaking in his human incarnation (cf. Philippians 2:7 &quot;but
made himself nothing, taking the very nature of a servant&quot;;
also Luke 2:52, &quot;And Jesus grew in wisdom and stature, and
in favor with God and men.&quot; Clearly, Jesus was not omniscient
as a human being.) Sometimes the passage in Matthew is also used
to claim that the Holy Spirit is not omniscient, since it does
not know when Jesus will come back. First, it should be noted
that the Holy Spirit is not mentioned in the passage in Matthew
at all; secondly, the thought that the Holy Spirit is less than
knowledgeable about the things of God is contradicted by the following
passage in 1 Corinthians 2:10-11:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;But God has revealed it to us by his Spirit. The Spirit
searches all things, even the deep things of God. For who among
men knows the thoughts of a man except the man's spirit within
him? In the same way no one knows the thoughts of God except the
Spirit of God.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The Holy Spirit is therefore presented as knowing all that God
knows.
<P>
Some people may attempt to argue that the Holy Spirit is simply
an impersonal force or power, pointing out that the Hebrew word
for Spirit, <I>ruah</I>, like the Greek word, <I>pneumos</I>,
can also mean &quot;wind&quot;. However, it must be pointed out
that &quot;wind&quot; is an option only in very limited circumstances,
i.e., in those cases where <I>ruah</I> is not in a genitival relationship
with a person. If the word is linked as in Genesis 1:2 &quot;The
<I>ruah</I> of God...&quot; then the only possibility linguistically
is &quot;Spirit&quot;, &quot;breath&quot;, or &quot;emotion&quot;.
&quot;Active force&quot; in an impersonal sense is never an option
with either the Greek or Hebrew words. Notice 1 John 4:13- 15:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
We know that we live in him and he in us, because he has given
us of his Spirit. And we have seen and testify that the Father
has sent his Son to be the Savior of the world. If anyone acknowledges
that Jesus is the Son of God, God lives in him and he in God.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Notice that John says that God lives in the believer. But before
that, he says that believers have been given &quot;of his Spirit&quot;.
Notice too, what some other passages say about who lives inside
believers:
<P>
<I><B>Romans 8:9</B></I> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
You, however, are controlled not by the sinful nature but by the
Spirit, if the Spirit of God lives in you. And if anyone does
not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Christ.

<P>
The believer is called the temple of God, yet what the believer
has inside him is the &quot;Spirit of God&quot;, which in Romans
is also called &quot;the Spirit of Christ&quot;, once again making
Christ and God equivalent.
<P>
<B>IV. The Father is God</B>

<P>
Notice that the word &quot;name&quot; is singular, not plural.
There is one name ascribed to all members of the Godhead: Yahweh.
To suppose that the Son and the Spirit are somehow less than the
Father makes a mockery of this instruction. How can the Father
be Almighty God and yet be linked to beings -- creatures -- who
are anything less? Such an idea is blasphemous. The Son and the
Holy Spirit are as much God as the Father is.
<P>
<B>The Ante-Nicene Fathers</B> 
<P>
It is said by some that &quot;the testimony of the Bible and of
history makes clear that the Trinity was unknown throughout Biblical
times and for several centuries thereafter.&quot; Specifically,
it is argued that such church fathers as Justin Martyr (d. c.
165 AD), Irenaeus (d. c. 200 AD), Clement of Alexandria (d. c.
215 AD), Tertullian (d. c. 230 AD), Hyppolytus (d. c. 235 AD)
and Origen (d. c. 250 AD) did not believe in the Trinity or accept
Jesus as God. The following quotes from these church fathers would
tend to weaken such a contention:

Moreover, in the book of Exodus we have also perceived that the

<BLOCKQUOTE>
And now we, who believe on our Lord Jesus, who was crucified under
Pontius Pilate, when we exorcise all demons and evil spirits,

that Christ would suffer, and thereafter be Lord of all, yet that
[declaration] could not be understood by any man until He Himself
persuaded the apostles that such statements were expressly related
in the Scriptures. For He exclaimed before His crucifixion: 'The
Son of man must suffer many things and be rejected by the Scribes
and Pharisees, and be crucified, and on the third day rise again.'
And David predicted that He would be born from the womb before
sun and moon, according to the Father's will, and made Him known,
being Christ, as God strong and to be worshipped. (<I>The Ante-Nicene

Therefore the Father is Lord, and the Son is Lord, and the Father
is God and the Son is God; for He who is born of God is God. And
thus God is shown to be one according to the essence of His being
and power; but at the same time, as the administrator of the economy
of our redemption, He is both Father and Son: since the Father
of all is invisible and inaccessible to creatures, it is through
the Son that those who are to approach God must have access to
the Father. Moreover David speaks clearly and most manifestly
of the Father and Son, as follows: Thy throne, O God, is for ever
and ever; Thou hast loved justice, and hated iniquity, therefore
God hath anointed Thee with the oil of gladness above Thy fellows.
For this means that the Son, being God, receives from the Father,
that is, from God, the throne of the everlasting kingdom, and
the oil of anointing above His fellows. And 'oil of anointing'
is the Spirit, through whom He is the Anointed, and 'His fellows'
are the prophets and the just and the apostles, and all who receive
fellowship of His kingdom, that is, His disciples. (Joseph P.

&quot;We have been taught that He proceeds forth from God, and

is a Spirit. Even when the ray is shot from the sun, it is still
part of the parent mass; the sun will still be in the ray, because
it is a ray of the sun -- there is no division of substance, but
merely an extension. Thus Christ is Spirit of Spirit, and God
of God, as light of light is kindled. The material matrix remains
entire and unimpaired, though you derive from it any number of
shoots possessed of its qualities; so, too, that which has come
forth out of God is at once God and the Son of God, and the two
are one. In this way also, as He is Spirit of Spirit and God of
God, He is made a second in manner of existence -- in position,
not in nature; and He did not withdraw from the original source,
but went forth. This ray of God, then, as it was always foretold
in ancient times, descending into a certain virgin, and made flesh
in her womb, is in His birth God and man united. (<I>Ante-Nicene

not by the word in the sense of being articulated by voice, but
as a ratiocination of the universe, conceived and residing in
the divine mind. Him alone He produced from existing things; for
the Father Himself constituted existence, and the being born from
Him was the cause of all things that are produced. The Logos was
in the Father Himself, bearing the will of his progenitor, and
not being unacquainted with the mind of the Father. For simultaneously
with His procession from His Progenitor, inasmuch as He is this
Progenitor's first-born, He has, as a voice in Himself, the ideas
conceived in the Father. And so it was, that when the Father ordered
the world to come into existence the Logos one by one completed

of this God is from God himself; wherefore also the Logos is God,

Notice what is written about this phrase in the <I>Theological
Dictionary of the New Testament</I>:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The description of Christ as <I>prototokos pases ktiseos</I> in
Col. 1:15 obviously finds in the <I>hoti</I> clause of v. 16 its
more precise basis and explanation: Christ is the mediator at
creation to whom all creatures without exception owe their creation,
see V. 894, 28ff. Hence <I>prototokos pases ktiseos</I> does not
simply denote the priority in time of the pre-existent Lord. If
the expression refers to the mediation of creation through Christ,
it cannot be saying at the same time that He was created as the
first creature. The decisive objection to this view, which sees
in the <I>pase ktiseos</I> a partitive genitive, is that it would
demand emphasis on the <I>tokos,</I> whereas with the exception
of Lk. 2:7 (see 876,6 ff.), which refers to literal birth, the
<I>tokos</I> is never emphasized in the NT passages which speak
of Christ, especially Col. 1:18 (see 877, 15ff.). A further point
is that this view would bring <I>-tokos</I> into tension with
<I>ktiseos</I> (and <I>ktisesthai</I> in 1:16), for creation and
birth are different concepts and <I>prototokos</I> cannot be regarded
as a simple synonym of <I>protoktistos.</I> The only remaining
possibility is to take <I>prototokos</I> hierarchically (see line
7f.). What is meant is the unique supremacy of Christ over all
creatures as the mediator of their creation. The succeeding statement
in 1:17a; <I>autos estin propanton,</I> emphasizes the same supremacy,
while 1:17b draws the conclusion from 1:16. If <I>prototokos</I>
is selected in Col. 1:15 and then again in 1:18 to express this
supremacy, this is because of the great importance which the term
&quot;firstborn&quot; took on as a word for rank in the OT and
then retained in later Judaism. (<I>TDNT</I>, Kittel, vol. VI,

Trinity, the doctrine of God taught by Christianity that asserts
that God is one in essence but three in &quot;person,&quot; Father,
Son, and Holy Spirit. Neither the word Trinity, nor the explicit
doctrine as such, appears in the New Testament, nor did Jesus
and his followers intend to contradict the <I>Shema</I> in the
Old Testament: &quot;Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God is one Lord&quot;
(Deut. 6:4). The earliest Christians, however, had to cope with
the implications of the coming of Jesus Christ and of the presence
and power of God among them -- i.e., the Holy Spirit, whose coming
was connected with the celebration of the Pentecost. The Father,
Son, and Holy Spirit were associated in such New Testament passages
as the Great Commission: &quot;Go therefore and make disciples
of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of
the Son and of the Holy Spirit&quot; (Matt. 28:19); and in the
apostolic benediction: &quot;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ
and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with
you all&quot; (II Cor. 13:14). Thus, the New Testament established
the basis for the doctrine of the Trinity.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The doctrine developed gradually over several centuries and through
many controversies. Initially, both the requirements of monotheism
inherited from the Old Testament and the implications of the need
to interpret the biblical teaching to Greco-Roman paganism seemed
to demand that the divine in Christ as the Word, or Logos, be
interpreted as subordinate to the Supreme Being. An alternative
solution was to interpret Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as three
modes of the self- disclosure of the one God but not as distinct
within the being of God itself. The first tendency recognized
the distinctness among the three, but at the cost of their equality
and hence of their unity (sub-ordinationism); the second came
to terms with their unity, but at the cost of their distinctness
as &quot;persons&quot; (modalism). It was not until the 4th century
that the distinctness of the three and their unity were brought
together in a single orthodox doctrine of one essence and three
persons. The Council of Nicea in 325 stated the crucial formula
for that doctrine in its confession that the Son is &quot;of the
same essence [homo-ousios] as the Father,&quot; even though it
said very little about the Holy Spirit. Over the next half century,
Athanasius defended and refined the Nicene formula, and, by the
end of the 4th century, under the leadership of Basil of Caesarea,
Gregory of Nyssa, and Gregory of Nazianzus (the Cappadocian Fathers),
the doctrine of the Trinity took substantially the form it has
maintained ever since. (See <I>Reasoning,</I> p. 405)

From what has been seen thus far, the impression could arise that
the Trinitarian dogma is in the last analysis a late 4th-century
invention. In a sense, this is true; but it implies an extremely
strict interpretation of the key words Trinitarian and dogma.
Triadic Consciousness in the Primitive Revelation. The formulation
&quot;one God in three Persons&quot; was not solidly established,
certainly not fully assimilated into Christian life and its profession
of faith, prior to the end of the 4th century. But it is precisely
this formulation that has first claim to the title the Trinitarian
dogma. Among the Apostolic Fathers, there had been nothing even
remotely approaching such a mentality or perspective; among the
2nd-century Apologists, little more than a focusing of the problem
as that of plurality within the unique Godhead. Not before Tertullian
and Origen, early in the century following, had an attempt been
made to solve the problem once raised by replying to the double
question: in what sense is God one, in what sense three? And even
then, results had been far from decisive....

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Another way of saying the same thing, however, is not the only
oversimplified interpretation possible in this matter. If it is
clear on one side that the dogma of the Trinity in the stricter
sense of the word was a late arrival, product of 3 centuries'
reflection and debate, it is just as clear on the opposite side
that confession of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit -- and hence an
elemental Trinitarianism -- went back to the period of Christian
origins. Contemporary studies on the ancient Christian creeds
have done much to bring this out. (See <I>Reasoning,</I> p. 405)

The trinity of God is defined by the Church as the belief that
in God are three persons who subsist in one nature. The belief
as so defined was reached only in the 4th and 5th centuries AD
and hence is not explicitly and formally a biblical belief. The
trinity of persons within the unity of nature is defined in terms
of &quot;person&quot; and &quot;nature&quot; which are Gk philosophical
terms; actually the terms do not appear in the Bible. The trinitarian
definitions arose as the result of long controversies in which
these terms and others such as &quot;essence&quot; and &quot;substance&quot;
were erroneously applied to God by some theologians. The ultimate
affirmation of trinity of persons and unity of nature was declared
by the Church to be the only correct way in which these terms
could be used.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The elements of the trinity of persons within the unity of nature
in the Bible appear in the use of the terms Father, Son, and Spirit.
The personal reality of the Spirit emerged more slowly than the
personal reality of Father and Son which are personal terms. On
the application of the name of Spirit to the Son in Pauline writings
cf SPIRIT. The unity of nature does not appear as a problem in
the Bible, and indeed could only arise when a philosophical investigation
of the term nature as applied to God was begun. In the NT the
Father is &quot;the God&quot; (Gk <I>ho theos</I>), and Jesus
is &quot;the Son of the God&quot; (<I>ho hyios tou theou</I>).
The Spirit is &quot;the Spirit of the God&quot; or &quot;the Holy
Spirit,&quot; in this context a synonymous term. Deity is conceived
not in the Gk term of nature but rather as a level of being, &quot;the
holy&quot;; between this level and the level of &quot;flesh&quot;
there is an impassable gulf. Impassable, that is, by man; it is
bridged by Jesus, the Son, who renders it possible for men to
be adopted sons. Without an explicit formula the NT leaves no
room to think that Jesus is Himself an object of the adoption
which He communicates to others. He knows the Father and reveals
Him. He therefore belongs to the divine level of being; and there
is no question at all about the Spirit belonging to the divine
level of being. (see <I>Reasoning,</I> p. 406)

Consider what McKenzie had to say on page 317 under the entry
on &quot;God&quot;:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The word <I>theos</I> is used to designate the gods of paganism.
Normally the word with or without the article designates the God
of the Old Testament and of Judaism, the God of Israel: Yahweh.
But the character of God is revealed in an original way in the
NT; the originality is perhaps best summed up by saying that God
reveals Himself in and through Jesus Christ. The revelation of
God in Jesus Christ does not consist merely in the prophetic word
as in the OT, but in an identity between God and Jesus Christ.
Jn 1:1-18 expresses this by contrasting the word spoken by the
prophets with the word incarnate in Jesus. In Jesus the personal
reality of God is manifested in visible and tangible form.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
In the words of Jesus and in much of the rest of the NT the God
of Israel (Gk <I>ho theos</I>) is the Father of Jesus Christ.
It is for this reason that the title <I>ho theos,</I> which now
designated the Father as a personal reality, is not applied in
the NT to Jesus Himself; Jesus is the Son of God (of<I> ho theos</I>).
This is a matter of usage and not of rule, and the noun is applied
to Jesus a few times. Jn 1:1 should rigorously be translated &quot;the
word was with the God [= the Father], and the word was a divine
being.&quot; Thomas invokes Jesus with the titles which belong
to the Father, &quot;My Lord and my God&quot; (Jn 20:28). &quot;The
glory of our great God and Savior&quot; which is to appear can
be the glory of no other than Jesus (Tt 2:13).

<B>OTHER MISQUOTES</B> 
<P>
<I>The Watchtower</I> for May 15, 1977 quotes William Barclay
as follows:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Now normally, except for special reasons, Greek nouns always have
the definite article in front of them,...When a Greek noun has
not got the article in front of it, it becomes rather a description
than an identification, and has the character of an adjective
rather than of a noun. We can see exactly the same in English.
If I say: 'James is the man', then I identify James with some
definite man whom I have in mind; but, if I say: 'James is man',
then I am simply describing James as human, and the word man has
become a description and not an identification. If John had said
<I>ho theos</I> <I>en ho logos,</I> using a definite article in
front of both nouns, then he would definitely have identified
the <I>logos</I> [the Word] with God, but because he has no definite
article in front of theos it becomes a description, and more of
an adjective than a noun. The translation then becomes, to put
it rather clumsily, 'The Word was in the same class as God, belonged
to the same order of being as God'....John is not here identifying
the Word with God. To put it very simply, he does not say that
Jesus was God.

<P>
There is a tendency, when disparaging the beliefs of another person

the Watchtower Society will give an inaccurate rendering of the
Trinitarian dogma, and then tear apart their portrayal of that
dogma. Unfortunately, in so doing, they have failed to argue against
the actual Trinitarian belief. Related to the strawman argument
is that called &quot;poisoning the well&quot;; for instance, an
individual or organization will be linked to others with whom
they have no direct relationship.

Poisoning the well also relates to the practice of finding fault
with a group or individual and then making the statement &quot;see,
you can't believe anything they say&quot;; such a conclusion does
not reasonably follow. Human beings make mistakes; even if you
know someone is habitually a liar, you cannot be certain that
he is always lying. For instance, if Adolph Hitler says the sun
rises in the east, one would have to accept the statement as valid,
despite how bad Hitler is, because the statement is true. One
does not get rid of truth by attacking the source of the statement.
<P>
The fact that the Catholic Church precipitated the Crusades, slaughtering
thousands of innocent people, often times just for financial benefit,
is no reason to reject the statement &quot;Jesus is the Son of
God&quot;, although the Catholic Church makes this pronouncement.
A fact remains a fact no matter who is throwing it. Just because
there are some errors in any group, it does not mean that everything
they say is wrong.

<I><B>2. Argument from Authority</B></I> 
<P>
To quote multiple scholars, to make statements along the lines
that &quot;eleven German translations render the verse this way&quot;
is not a valid method of argument.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
...if experts rather than laymen are disputing over a question
in the field in which they themselves are experts, their appeal
would be only to the facts and to reason, and any appeal to the
authority of another expert would be completely without value
as evidence. (Irving M. Copi. <I> Introduction to Logic</I>. New
York: Macmillan, 1982, p. 105)

Listing all the scholars who have translated John 1:1 in a manner
consistent with the Watchtower perspective is not a reasoned defense
of that translation. It merely indicates that there are other
people of like opinion. The question that needs to be answered
is not how many names can be listed in agreement, but, what are
the reasons for the translation, and are those reasons valid?
Furthermore, if they wish to argue against the majority view,
they should give the arguments of that view, and then systematically
answer that argument, giving counter arguments -- without resource
to statements like &quot;and so and so agrees with us.&quot; It
doesn't matter who agrees with you; what matters are your arguments.

<B>EDUCATION</B>

An interesting question may be asked: why does the Watchtower
Society not encourage its members to learn Greek? Then they would
have thousands of scholars supporting their position after an
investment of only a couple years. Of course the argument is made
that the Watchtower Society already has a good translation and
so it is unnecessary. Yet, in the Christian churches, almost all
the pastors have at least two years of Greek training, even though
they have access to many translations. All translations are imperfect,
since they are created by fallible human beings. No translation
can fully represent what exists in the original language: for
instance, plays on words, alliteration, rhymes, and just the sound
and feel of the words do not translate. To fully comprehend the
text in all its richness and depth, one must see it in its original
form. Take Shakespeare for instance: do you seriously think it
feels the same in German? How much more the Bible, then! Someone
once said that reading a text in translation is like making love
with your clothes on.
<P>
One wonders if perhaps the reason the Watchtower Society does
not encourage its members to learn Greek is because they might
arrive at conclusions at variance with those of the Society. Of
course, it is interesting to note that Charles T. Russell (1852-1916),
the first President of the Watchtower Society sued a man named
J.J. Ross for &quot;defamatory libel&quot; in March 1913. Ross,
in his booklet, <I>Some Facts About the Self-styled Pastor C.T.
Russell</I> wrote, &quot;Russell does not know the dead languages.&quot;
In the court room, Russell proved that Ross was right:

Fred Franz also claims to have been nominated a Rhodes Scholar.
<I>Faith on the March</I> [a Watchtower Publication] on page 181
states:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
A scholar from his youth, Franz is a keen student of the Bible.
Born in Covington, Kentucky, in 1893, he carried away the honors
of the University of Cincinnati and was offered the privilege
of going to Oxford or Cambridge in England under the Rhodes Plan.
Instead, in 1914, he entered the full-time ministry.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Yet, according to a letter from The Rhodes Scholarship Trust of
January 14, 1981:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I have checked our records and do not find that Frederick William
Franz was elected to a Rhodes Scholarship. Our records, I should
note, refer only to Scholars from the United States. Unless Mr.
Franz has competed successfully as a candidate for the Scholarship
in another country, you may conclude that his claim to have been
a Rhodes Scholar is incorrect. (<I>Pursuer's Proof</I>, p. 102)

In the Watchtower Publication <I>Should You Believe in the Trinity?</I>
it needs to be noted that at least ninety percent of the sources
quoted are taken out of context in order to try to make them say
the opposite of their intent. It should therefore be understood
that the Watchtower Society is virtually alone in its belief that
the Bible does not teach the Trinity.
<P>
<B>Conclusion</B> 
<P>
The doctrine of the Trinity has been firmly entrenched in Christian
teaching since the New Testament. It is the plain teaching of
the Bible and it is impossible to deny that the Son and Holy Spirit
are as much God as the Father.
<P>
More importantly, it needs to be noted that the deity of Jesus
is necessary in order for his sacrifice on the cross to be sufficient
payment for our sins.
<P>
The result of sin is everlasting torment in Hell -- an infinite
penalty. Only an infinite being -- God -- could take such a penalty.
Therefore, Jesus must be God.
<P>
Since Jehovah's Witnesses deny the Trinity, at least they are
consistent in arguing that the death of Christ is not sufficient
for final salvation. Therefore Jehovah's Witnesses must teach
that works are necessary for salvation -- that an individual must
&quot;contribute&quot; to his or her own salvation.
<P>
However, such a concept flies in the face of plain biblical teaching:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith -- and this
not from yourselves, it is the gift of God -- not by works, so
that no one can boast (Ephesians 2:8-9).
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Therefore, even the doctrine of salvation by grace through faith
teaches the necessity of the Trinity.
