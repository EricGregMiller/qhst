<h1><b>The End of Judah</b></h1>
<P>
After the reign of Hezekiah there is no record in the Assyrian
inscriptions of any further raid on Judah. Till Assyria's end
in 612 BC, no king of Judah apparently dared defy the mighty power
of the Assyrians. From the archeological point of view this fact
is rerettable, since it means that from that point on the Assyrian
records have virtually no accasion to mention the Jews. Therefore,
the important Manesseh-Amon-Josiah era (687-609 BC) is almost
a blank as far as archeology is concerned.
<P>
However, Assyria had two of its greatest kings after the death
of Sennacherib: Esarhaddon (680-669 BC), Sennacherib's son, and
Ashurbanipal (669-633 BC), his son's son, and the last great Assyrian
monarch. Esarhaddon, a famous (in his day) conqueror who defeated
Taharka, Pharaoah of Egypt, was the fist Assyrian ruler to add
to his grandiose array of titles, &quot;King of the kings of Egypt.&quot;
Esarhaddon's brilliant victory over Taharka was celebrated with
a victory stele set up at Senjirli in northern Syria. In 1888
a German expedition discovered the stele.
<P>
Esarhaddon is taken to be referred to as the &quot;cruel and fierce
king&quot; mentioned in Isaiah 19:2, who realized the highest
ambition of all Assyrians: the conquest of Egypt. Esarhaddon is
apparently referred to several times in the Old Testament; for
instance in Ezra 4:2 he is metioned as the king who colonized
Samaria.
<P>
Ashurbanipal was also a noted conqueror, but is better known for
his cultural efforts. The large royal library that he established
in Nineveh was discovered in 1853. It preserved vast quantities
of Assyrian and Babylonian literature, notably the Babylonian
story of creation and the Babylonian flood account. Ashurbanipal
is mentioned only once in the Bible, and then under a Hebraized
form of his name: &quot;the great and noble Osnappar&quot; (or
&quot;Asnapper&quot;), who is also said to have colonized Samaria.
<P>
<B>The Decline of the Hebrew Monarchy</B> 
<P>
During the zenith of Assyrian power there was a sharp decline
in the moral stability of the occupants on the throne of Judah.
Separation from the contaminating practices of the surrounding
pagan nations had always been better with the southern kingdom,
but their natural synchretizing tendencies seemed to have increased
just before the end, rendering their destruction certain.
<P>
<B>Manesseh and Judah's Idolatrous Orgy. </B>Hezekiah's son, Manesseh
(687-642 BC), was a complete contrast to his father. Where Hezekiah
had attempted to eliminate idolatry and strenghthen the kingdom
of Judah both morally and spiritually, Manessah worked hard at
introducing a thorough-going religious syncretism that utterly
perverted Yahwish and earned him the reputation of being &quot;the
most wicked king of Judah&quot; (2 Kings 21:1-15; 2 Chron. 33:1-20).
Manesseh's reign was one of the longest in the Davidic line (55
years, according to 2 Kings 21:1), and it opened the door wide
to Canaanite paganism and did more to demoralize the nation and
drag it inevitably toward the maelstrom of the Babylonian captivity
than perhaps any other single factor in the history of Judah.
<P>
Archeology has shed a great deal of light on the religious syncretism
of Manasseh. Baal, to whom he &quot;raised up altars&quot; (2
Kings 21:3) is now well known as the chief god of the Canaanite
pantheon and identified with the storm god Hadad. The Baal cult
included worship and dancing on wooded hilltops called &quot;high
places&quot;. Manasseh &quot;built again the high places which
Hezekiah his father had destroyed and made an Asherah&quot; (2
Kings 21:3).
<P>
Asherah, as is now well-known from the Ugaritic epic literature
of the 14th c. BC was the consort of the chief Canaanite deity
El. But by the ninth century and later in Palestine she was regarded
as the wife of Baal. There is some recent evidence to suggest
that she became recognized as the consort of Yahweh, who then
himself was given many of the attributes of Baal.
<P>
The &quot;Asherah&quot; which Manasseh made was probably an image
of this pagan goddess (although it possibly could have been a
sacred tree or grove of trees). Asherah (together with her alaises,
Anath, Astarte and Ashtoreth) was a patroness of sex and war.
She was often represented as a pregnant &quot;virgin&quot;. Worship
of Asherah often consisted of having sex with a prostitute in
her temple.
<P>
Manessah also cultivated star and planetary worship (2 Kings 21:3,
5) and the cult of Moloch, an Ammonite deity, whose worship was
closely connected with astral divination (Amos 5:25, 26; Acts
7:41-43) and whose ritual was characterized by parents' sacrificing
their children by compelling them to pass through or into a furnace
of fire. Excavations in Palestine have uncovered piles of ashes
and the remains of infant skeletons in cemetaries around the altars,
apparently pointing to the widespread practice of this sort of
sacrifice.
<P>
An interesting reference to idolatry and Moloch worship and their
connection with demonism is found in Psalm 106:36-37. The Hebrews
are said to have mingled themselves with the nations...learned
their works and served their idols...and eventhey have sacrificed
their sons and daughters to demons...&quot; In fact, Manasseh's
idolatries were the result of a gigantic outburst of demon-energized
occultism. He is said to have practiced augury (that is, the prophetic
divining of the future by observation of natgural phenomena--
particularly the behavior of birds and animals and the examniation
of their entrails and other parts, but also by scrutny of man-made
objects and situations [among the vast number of sources of augury,
each with its own specialist jargon and ritual, were atmospheric
phenomena (aeromancy), cards (cartomancy), dice or lots (cleromancy),
dots and other marks on paper (geomancy), fire and smoke (pyromancy),
the shoulder blades of animals (scapulimancy), entrails of sacrificed
animals (haruspicy), or their livers which were considered to
be the seat of life (hepatoscopy).] Manasseh is said to have used
enchantment, and dealt with those that had familiar spirits (divining
demons) and with wizards (those possessed of occult knowledge
became under the control of a divining demon; 2 Chron. 33:6 or
2 Kings 21:6). This sort of thing was the result of the Canaanite
influence (perhaps brought by the Northern Kingdom refugees filtering
down into the southern kingdom following its collapse and absorbtion
by the Assyrian empire in 721 BC (Cf. Ecc. 6:12). When people
no longer listen to God, they still want these questions answered,
and will accept and seek any possibility, however ludicrous or
evil.
<P>
Archeology has uncovered a vast quantity of evidence of the prevalence
of demonic phenomena among the ancient peoples of the Bible lands.
Tablets containing incatations, augural prognostications and exorcistic
rituals show how rife belief in and enslavement to evil spirits
were and prove that magic, divination, necromancy, and every variety
of occultism were practiced in the ancient biblical world. Indeed,
it is from Mesopotamia &quot;that our richest sources for the
study of early magic and divination come.&quot; This occultism
was primarily the result of polytheism.
<P>
<B>Manasseh and the Assyrian Monuments. </B>The light shed on
Manasseh's reign by archeology is for the most part of an indirect
nature. However, there is one direct reference in the inscriptions
of Esarhaddon to the Judean king that is of considerable interest.
Particularly, because it illuminates the account of Manesseh's
being carried away captive to Babylon, his repentance and subsequent
restoration to his throne. According to the account in 2 Chron.
33:10-13 (not found in the equivalent passage in 2 Kings), Yahweh
brought upon the idolatrous and unrepentant Manesseh and his people
&quot;the captain of the ouse of the king of Assyria, who took
Manesseh with hooks and bound him with fetters, and carried him
to Babylon.&quot;
<P>
On the Senjirli Stele of Esarhaddon, Baalu, king of Tyre, is shown
lifting manacled hands in supplication to Assyria and beside him
is Tirhakah, king of Ethiopia, portrayed with a hook through his
lips and tied by a rope to Esarhaddon's hands.
<P>
As far as the fact of Manasseh's Babylonian captivity is concerned,
there is no confirmation of this notice of the Chronicler. But
the inscriptions of Esarhaddon do speak of the compulsory visit
of Manesseh to the great Assyrian capital, Nineveh, about the
year 678 BC:
<P>
<blockquote>At that time the older palace of Nineveh, which the kings who
went before, my fathers, had built...had come to seem too small
to me...and the people of the lands my arms had despoiled I made
to carry the basket and the hod [a hod is a tray or trough with
a pole handle that is borne on the shoulder for carrying mortar,
brick, or similar loads]....That small palace I tore down in its
totality....And I summoned the kings of Syria and those across
the sea -- Baalu, king of Tyre, Manasseh, king of Judah, Kaushgabri,
king of Edom, Musurri, king of Moab...Milki-ashapa, king of Gebail
[Byblos], etc., etc....twenty kings in all. I gave them their
orders.</blockquote>
<P>
The reference to Manasseh's captivity in Babylon was once commonly
regarded as a mistake on the part of the Chronicler; most scholars
thought that the Chronicler really meant that he'd been held captive
in Nineveh. However, the inscriptions prove that Esarhaddon did
in fact rebuild the ancient city of Babylon destroyed by his father
Sennacherib:
<P>
<blockquote>...At the beginning of my rule, in the first year of my reign,
when I took my seat upon the royal throne in might, there appeared
favorable signs in the heavens and on earth....Through the soothsayers'
rites encouraging oracles were disclosed, and for the rebuilding
of Babylon and the restoration of Esagila [temple of the gods],
they caused the command [oracle] to be written down.</blockquote>
<P>
Esarhaddon continues his description of the rebuilding of Babylon:
<P>
<blockquote>I summoned all of my artisans and the people of Babylonia in their
totality. I made them carry the basket and laid the head pad upon
them...I raised the hod [a hod is a tray or trough with a pole
handle that is borne on the shoulder for carrying mortar, brick,
or similar loads] to my head and carried it...I moulded brick...Babylon
I built anew, I enlarged, I raised aloft, I made magnificent.</blockquote>
<P>
With such an achievement as the rebuilding of Babylon to his credit,
it is not likely that Esarhaddon would have allowed Manasseh and
the other kings he had summoned to Nineveh, to return to their
countries without seeing this accomplishment of which he seems
very proud.
<P>
<B>The Reformation of Josiah. </B>As a young child of eight Josiah
came to the throne when his father Amon, son of Manesseh, was
murdered following a very short reign of only two years (c. 642-c.
640 BC). Josiah's rule lasted much longer: from c. 640 to about
609 BC. Moreover, his reign is classified by the Bible as a good
one. The outstanding event in his reign was the discovery of the
&quot;book of the law&quot;, brought to light in the course of
extensive repairs on the temple. The reading of this book lead
to a great revival and reformation (2 Kings 23:3-23:37).
<P>
Whether the &quot;book of the law&quot; was the Pentateuch or
only the book of Deuteronomy, an alternate theory to that taught
by most critics is possible. Since the discovery is closely linked
with the activity of the stonemasons and carpenters, it is not
entirely unreasonable to suppose that this copy of the Pentateuch
had been placed in the cornerstone of the temple when it was erected
by Solomon (c. 966 BC). Perhaps the masonry had so cracked over
the intervening years that this stone had to be replaced and so
the documents came to light.
<P>
This, it seems to me, is not less reasonable an explanation for
the discovery than that of prevailing criticism which views the
&quot;book of the lw&quot; as essentially Deuteronomy and as a
late concoction of the seventh century BC, which was not so much
&quot;discovered&quot; as &quot;created&quot; and then foisted
upon a credulous king and people by a crafty clergy as an ancient
Mosaic document. It is clear, from archeological excavations,
for instance, that it was customary to place documents in the
foundations of buildings, as is done even to the present day.
Hense, the other proposed explanation for the discovery -- that
it is a real discovery. Nabonidus, a Babylonian king of the sixth
century BC, for example, delighted digging into the foundations
of ancient buildings to recover the documents deposited there
centuries earlier. He did this, for instance, at the temple of
Shamash at Sippar in lower Mesopotamia:
<P>
<blockquote>When I had brought out Shamash from within it, and made him dwell
in another house, that house I tore down, and made a search for
its old foundation record; and I dug to a depth of 18 cubits and
the foundation record of Naram-Sin the son of Sargon, Shamash...permitted
me, even me, to behold</blockquote>
<P>
The question that remains, of course: why was the law unknown
to Josiah and the other people of his time? Shouldn't the Mosaic
legislation have been widely deseminated in Israel? Or had they
really sunk so low after the time of Solomon that they didn't
even bother to read or copy the &quot;book of the law?&quot;
<P>
<B>The Death of Josiah. </B>Archeology has facilitated a correct
translation of the passage dealing with Josiah's death and revealed
the reason for Pharoah Necho's advance toward the Euphrates. &quot;In
Josiah's days Pharaoh Necho, king of Egypt, went up to the king
of Assyria to the river Euphrates. King Josiah went to meet him;
and Pharaoh Necho slew him at Megiddo, when he saw him.&quot;
(2 Kings 23:29, RSV; NIV writes that he went up to &quot;help&quot;
him). Up to this time in the absence of an archeological clue
the phrase &quot;Pharoach Necho went up to the king of Assyria&quot;
has been wrongly translated ast &quot;went up AGAINST the King
of Assyria&quot; (cf. KJV and ASV). While it is true that the
Hebrew preposition <I>'al</I> here used may mean &quot;against&quot;,
the historical context shows that in this passage it has one of
its more specialized meanings.
<P>
Historians used to be perplexed as to why Josiah advanced &quot;against&quot;
Necho when the Pharaoh was on his way to fight Assyria, the ancient
enemy of the Hebrews. The Babylonian Chronicle, published by C.J.
Gadd in 1923 has put the whole matter in a different light, demonstrating
that Pharaoh Necho did not advance against the Assyrians at all,
but rather was going to their aid.
<P>
Upon Ashurbanipal's death in 633 BC, the Assyrian Empire declined
rapidly. In 612 BC Nineveh fell under attack by a coalition of
Babylonians, Medes and Scythians. A remnant of the Assyrian army
fled west to Haran and made it a temporary capital. The king of
Egypt, Pharaoh Necho, accordingly, came to help the Assyran remnant
and their king Ashuruballit, who stood at bay for several years
at Carchemish under the combined attacks of the Medes and the
Babylonians.
<P>
Josiah, no lover of Assyria, and not wishing any aid to reach
the hard-pressed Assyrians, went to Megiddo to stop Necho, but
was killed by him instead. Necho, in turn, was overwhelmingly
defeatred when he eventually clashed with Nebuchadnezzer at the
famous battle of Carchemesh (Qarqar) on the Euphrates in 605 BC.
<P>
With the battle of Carchemesh two ancient empires fell. Assyria
passed away forever, and Egypt never again became a first-rate
power. The magnificent city of Carchemesh, with a long and brilliant
career behind it, was utterly destroyed by Nebuchadnezzer and
lay buried under desert dust until excavations in the first half
of the twentieth century brought the monuments back to light (during
the 1930's).
<P>
<B>The Hebrew Monarchy Under Egyptian Control. </B>With the death
of Josiah in 609 BC, the throne of Judah temporarily passed under
the domination of Egypt. Jehoahaz, son of Josiah, was made king,
but reigned only three months before being deposed by Pharaoh
Necho (2 Kings 23:33), who took him to Egypt, where he later died
(2 Kings 23:34). After he deposed Jehoahaz, Pharaoh Necho made
Kliakim, another son of Josiah, king and changed his name to Jehoiakim
(609-605 BC). This king paid tribute to his Egyptian overlord
(2 Kings 23:35).
<P>
<B>The Hebrew Monarchy Under Babylonian Control. </B>In the gigantic
three-cornered contest for world supremacy between Assyria, Egypt,
and Babylon which characterized the latter part of the reign of
Josiah and was contemporary with the ministry of Jeremiah in Judah,
Babylon won out just as that great prophet had fortold. When Nebuchadnezzar
became master of Palestine, Jehoiakim shifted his allegiance to
him (2 Kings 24:1), and from then on, the kings of Judah were
vassals of the Babylonian king, and paid dearly when they attempted
to cast off their new chain.
<P>
Jehoiakim, the bitter enemy of Jeremiah and religious/moral reform,
was an opportunist who attempted to throw off Babylonian control
as he had thrown off his Egyptian allegiance when the im seemed
favorable. Doing so, however, he found the might of Babylon moving
against his capital. In the course of events that followed, he
was evidently assassinated. He received the &quot;burial of a
donkey&quot; according to Jeremiah 22:18-19.
<P>
With the death of Jehoiakim in 598 BC, his son Jehoiachin took
the throne. However, he managed to rule for barely three months
before being taken away captive to Babylon. There, he was a political
prisoner for thirty-seven years. He was finally released by Nebuchadnezzer's
successor whom the Bible refers to as Evil-merodach (Akk. Abel-marduk),
who gave him a daily allowance of food for the rest of his life
(2 Kings 25:27-30). This interesting detail of biblical history
has been singularly confirmed by Babylonian records which list
&quot;Yaukin of the land of Yahud&quot;, that is, Jehoiachin of
Judah, as one of the recipients of the royal rations. Moreover,
the name of Jehoiachin has been authenticated in excavations by
W.F. Albright and Melvin Grove Kyle at Tell Beit Mirsim (Kiryat-Sepher)
and by Elihu Grant, at Beth Shemesh.
<P>
<B>The Fall of Jerusalem</B> 
<P>
Jeremiah, by means of a long and faithful ministry that extended
through the last forty years of the nation of Judah, tried desperately
to save the people by calling upon them to repent. But, as God
had warned him, hardly anyone paid him any attention. Refusing
to heed Jeremiah's warnings, a terrible judgment finally fell
on Jerusalem and Judah.
<P>
<B>Zedekiah and the End of the Monarchy.</B> After removing Jehoiachin
from the throne of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar made Jehoiachin's uncle
Mattaniah king and changed his name to Zedekiah (2 Kings 24:17).
As a puppet of Nebuchadnezar, Zedekiah was continually under pressure
from his advisors and subjects to seek the help of Egypt and to
revolt against Babylon. Despite Jeremiah's solemn warnings against
this foolish course of action, Zedekiah turned to Pharaoh Hophra
(Apries; c. 588-569 BC) for aid and revolted against Nebuchadnezzar.
<P>
The result: the Babylonian army moved against Jerusalem, bent
on its complete destruction. In the seige that followed, pestilence,
famine, and even cannibalism prevailed (2 Kings 25:1; Jer. 32:24).
The appearance of the Egyptian army gave only a brief respite
to the besieged capital (Jer. 37:5). The city fell in 587 BC.
Zedekiah tried to escape, but was captured by the Babylonians
at Jericho and brought to trial before the king of Babylon at
Riblah, on the Orontes, fifty miles south of Hamath (Jer. 39:5-7).
<P>
Zedekiah saw his own sons put to death. Then they poked his eyes
out. Next, he was fettered and carried captive to Babylon, where
he was imprisoned until his death (2 Kings 25:1-7; Jeremiah 52:11).
Jerusalem was mercilessly sacked and razed to the ground (2 Kings
25:17-25:10). Thus, &quot;the year 587 BC marked the end not only
of a dynasty, but of an age.&quot;
<P>
<B>The Age of Jeremiah and the Lachish Letters.</B> The life and
times of Jeremiah have been vividly illustrated by the discovery
in 1935 by J.L. Starkey of eighteen ostraca inscribed in Hebrew
(using the old Hebrew or Phoenician script, rather than the square
Aramaic script). The documents were uncovered in the guard room
and adjoining outer gate of the city of Lachish (Tell ed-Duweir),
an ancient fortress of Judah, some twenty-five mmiles southwest
of Jerusalem. Three additional ostraca (raising the total found
to twenty-one), were discovered in the last excavation campaign
at Lachish in 1938.
<P>
These ostraca are composed of letters and name lists from the
period just preceding the final fall of Jerusalem. Nearly all
of tahem apparently date from the autumn of 589 BC, just two years
before the destruction of the city in August 587 BC, since they
belong to a layer of ash which represents the final destruction
of Lachis, which Nebuchadnezzar accomplished before the final
siege of Jerusalem.
<P>
Jeremiah, in one of his prophecies addressed to Zedekiah, makes
a reference to Judah's fortified cities, a reference which is
illuminated by the Lachish letters. He mentions &quot;when the
king of Babylon's army was fighting against Jerusalem, and against
all of the cities of Judah that were left, against Lachish and
against Azekah, for these alone remained of the cities of Judah
as fortified cities.&quot; (Jer. 34:7).
<P>
<B>Letter Number Four.</B> Letter Number Four relates:
<P>
<blockquote>We are watching for the signal stations of Lachish, according
to all the signals you are giving, because we cannot see the signals
of Azekah.</blockquote>
<P>
Interestingly, the same term her employed for &quot;signal&quot;
occures in Jeremiah 6:1: &quot;Flee for safety, you children of
Benjamin, out of the midst of Jerusalem, and blow the rumpet in
Tekoa, and raise up a signal on Beth-haccherem; for evil looks
forth from the north, and a great destruction.&quot;
<P>
Although the Mari letters of the eighteenth century BC have shown
that signalling by fire was practiced in the Euphrates valley
twelve centuries before Jeremiah's time, this letter from Lachish
sheds light on the system of signal telegraphy used by the Jewish
army in the last days of the kingdom of Judah. In addition, it
strikingly illustrates Jeremiah's reference to Lachish and Azekah
as fortified cities of Judah.
<P>
Both of these sites have been identified. Azekah (Tell Zakariya)
in the Shephelah was excavated by Frederick J. Bliss of the Palestine
Exploration Fund in 1898 and its strong fortifications were autheticated.
The same is true of Lachish itself, exxcavated by the Wellcome-Marston
Archelogical Expedition from 1933-1938 under the direction of
J. L. Starkey and continued after his death by Charles Inge and
Lankester Harding.
<P>
<B>Letter Number Three. </B>Letter Number Three is the most significant
of the entire collection of twenty-one letters, at least from
a biblical point of view. Like most of the others, it was written
by a certain Hoshaiah, who was stationed at some military outpost.
He was writing to someone named Jaosh, who apparently was the
high commanding officer at Lachish. The text runs as follows:
<P>
<blockquote>The servant Hoshaiah has sent to inform my lord Jaosh: May the
lord Yahweh cause my lord to hear tidings of peace! And now you
have sent a letter but my lord has not enlightened your servant
concerning the letter which you sent to your servant yesterday
evening, for the heart of your servant has been sick since you
wrote to your servant. And as for what my lord has said, &quot;You
do not know it! - read [any] letter,&quot; as the Lord lives no
one has undertaken to read me a letter at any time, nor have I
read anything for it! -- And it has been reported to your servant
saying, &quot;The commander of the army, Coniah son of Elnathan,
has come down in order to go into Egypt and to Hodaviah, son of
Ahijah, and his men he sent to me to obtain supplies from him,&quot;
-- And as for the letter of Tobiah, servant of the king [the king
being Zedekiah], which came to Shallum son of Jaddua through he
prophet, saying, &quot;Beware&quot;, your servant has sent it
to my lord.</blockquote>
<P>
Hoshaiah, like a number of names in the various letters, is biblical
and occures in Jeremiah 42:1 and Nehemiah 12:32. Jaosh is an abreviated
form of Josiah. All the words and phrases are characteristically
biblical, and God is referred to by the tetragrammaton YHWH. Many
names, too, are good biblical compounds of Yahweh.
<P>
The wordiness of the letter is largely due to the polite and idiomatic
use of &quot;my lord&quot; (Heb. <I>adoni</I>) in place of &quot;you&quot;
and &quot;your servant&quot; or &quot;slave&quot; for &quot;I&quot;
or &quot;me&quot;. This was standard practice in letters throughout
the ANE. The latter part of the letter seems clearly to refer
to a visit of the commanding officer of the Jewish army to Egypt
for military conferences with the officials of Pharaoh Psammetichus
II (594-588 BC), in preparation for the threatening Chaldean invasion.
The resultant expeditionary force is mentioned by Jeremiah: &quot;The
army of Pharaoh had come up out of Egypt; and when the Babylonians
who were besieging Jerusalem heard news of them, they withdrew
from Jerusalem.&quot; (37:5)
<P>
One of the most significant details of this reference is to &quot;the
prophet&quot;. While it is not impossible this might be an actual
reference to Jeremiah himself (and several commentators have argued
so, for instance Cyrus Gordon), there were othere prophets around
at the same time who left no surviving written records.
<P>
What is important, here, perhaps, more than the identification
of &quot;the prophet&quot; is the intimate contact here made with
the inner life of Israel and that &quot;here for the first time
outside the Old Testament we find mention of a 'prophet' of the
class which played so large a part in Hebrew history.&quot;
<P>
<B>Letter Number Six.</B> This letter is highly reminiscent of
Jeremiah 38:4, where the prophet, proclaiming the wisdom of surrendering
to the Babylonians, is thus accused by the princes before the
king: &quot;Let this man be put to death, for he is weakening
the hand of all the people by speaking such words to them.&quot;
The letter in question runs this way:
<P>
<blockquote>To my lord Yaosh, may Yahweh cause my lord to see this season
in good health! Who is your servant but a dog that my lord has
sent the letter of the king and the letters of the princes, saying
&quot;Pray, read them!&quot;? And behold the words of the princes
are not good, but to weaken your hands and to slacken the hands
of the men who are informed about them [?]...And now [?] my lord,
will you not write to them saying, &quot;Why do you thus even
[?] in Jerusalem? Behold the king and unto his house [?] are you
doing this thing!&quot; And as Yahweh your God lives, since your
servant read the letters, there has been no peace [?] for your
servant....</blockquote>
<P>
In the letter the alleged discouragement comes from the princes
rather than the prophet. Evidently, however, the patriot at the
front is one mind with the prophet at Jerusalem, realizing that
reliance on the promises of Egypt was luring Judah to her doom
and that true patriotism was encouraging the people to face the
certainty of a Babylonian victory.
<P>
Few books of the Bible have been more vividly illustrated by archeological
discoveries than the book of Jeremiah and few discoveries have
