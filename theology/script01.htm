<B>General Information About the Text</B> 
<P>
<I><B>Old Testament</B></I> 
<P>
The Old Testament is written mostly in Hebrew, except for the
following sections which are written in Aramaic (constituting
about one percent of the Old Testament): Genesis 31:47 (two words),
Jeremiah 10:11, Ezra 4:8-6:18; 7:12-26, and Daniel 2:4b-7:28.
<P>
<I><B>The Languages of the Old Testament</B></I> 
<P>
The Semitic family of languages do not include the oldest known
languages - that honor goes to Sumerian, a unique language which
is part of no known language family and bears no resemblance to
any other known language; it was written with cuneiform characters.
The earliest evidence for Semitic tongues are Akkadian texts dating
back to the third millennium B.C. Semitic is distantly related
to the Hamitic family of languages, which includes Egyptian, and
so in its earliest roots, the two are combined into what is called
Hamito-semitic. At a point in prehistory, they split into what
is called proto-Semitic and proto-Hamitic. From these, arise Egyptian
in the Hamitic branch, and on the Semitic side, the northwest
Semitic languages of Ugaritic, Moabite, Aramaic and Hebrew and
the Southeast Semitic languages such as Akkadian (divisible into
two dialects, Babylonian and Assyrian). The earlier Semitic languages,
such as Akkadian and Ugaritic have a case system which identifies
what role a noun is playing in a sentence. That is, a <I>u</I>
tacked on to the end of the word, as in <I>shar</I>, the Babylonian
word for prince, gives the form <I>sharu</I>, telling the reader
that the word is the subject of the sentence, as in &quot;The
Prince hears the Princess&quot;. An <I>a</I> tacked on to the
end - <I>shara</I> - makes the word the object, as in &quot;the
Princess hears the Prince.&quot; And an <I>i</I> tacked on at
the end as in <I>shari</I> makes the word possessive, as in &quot;the
Prince of the Princess&quot;.
<P>
In later Semitic languages such as Hebrew, the case system has
disappeared, so that word order now indicates the job assignments
that were previously provided by the case endings. Hebrew is one
of the latest of the known Semitic languages. Even Arabic, another
Semitic language, appears more ancient in its forms, since it
preserves the old Semitic case structure. The different Semitic
languages bear a general similarity with each other, as for instance
with the word for &quot;sun&quot;. In Akkadian it is <I>shamash</I>,
in Arabic it is <I>shamps </I>and in Hebrew it is <I>shemesh</I>.
<P>
<I><B>Hebrew</B></I> 
<P>
Hebrew was the language of the northern and southern kingdoms
of Israel and Judah respectively. It was used by the Jews until
the time of the Babylonian captivity, when the language of the
court, Aramaic, came more and more to replace it. When the Jewish
people returned from the Babylonian captivity around 536 B.C.
the Hebrew language had undergone some significant changes. Aramaic
words had been added to the vocabulary, and the alphabet was changed
from the Old Hebrew characters to the newer square Aramaic script
- which is the form still in use today. After the fall of Jerusalem
AD 70 and the subsequent dispersion, Hebrew, already barely more
than a liturgical language (used in the Synagogue for reading
scripture), ceased to be spoken altogether. Hebrew remained a
dead language, known only to scholars until the end of the nineteenth
century. With the rise of the Zionist movement in Europe, some
Jews started to revive Hebrew as a spoken tongue, so those Jews
who moved back into Palestine began speaking to one another in
the old Biblical language.
<P>
Today, the official language of the modern nation of Israel is
Hebrew and except for the addition of a few new words to account
for technological change like airplane and automobile the Modern
Hebrew language is virtually identical to that of the Bible.
<P>
<I><B>Aramaic</B></I> 
<P>
Aramaic, not to be confused with the language spoken by the Arabs
today - which is called Arabic - is a Semitic language used by
the neo-Babylonians of the time of Nebuchadnezzar II (cf. Book
of Daniel). It became the major language of the ancient Near East
and was spoken and written by most nations of the area until the
rise of Islam subjugated it and replaced it with Arabic.
<P>
The language most commonly spoken in Israel in Jesus' day was
Aramaic and in fact it is the language that Jesus himself spoke.
A few snatches are recorded in the New Testament, but most of
what remains are translations of his words into Greek, the language
used by the New Testament writers. They used Greek because it
was the language of the Roman Empire and the writers of the New
Testament were concerned that the message of the gospel should
get as wide a readership as possible. The translational nature
of Christ's words can be seen, for example, in the wording of
the beatitudes; Luke writes simply &quot;blessed are the poor&quot;,
while Matthew writes &quot;blessed are the poor in spirit&quot;.
The reason for the slight difference in the wording results from
the underlying Aramaic word for &quot;poor&quot;, which has both
ideas contained within it; Matthew, therefore, was a bit more
precise in his translation, since the Greek word for poor generally
- like the English term - refers only to those who lack material
benefits.
<P>
<I><B>New Testament</B></I> 
<P>
The New Testament is written entirely in Greek, except, as has
already been indicated, for a few Aramaic words or phrases: Matthew
27:33, Matthew 27:46, Mark 5:41, Mark 15:22, Mark 15:34, and John
19:17.
<P>
<I><B>Greek</B></I> 
<P>
Though the native language of the Romans was Latin, the language
of the Empire, and especially the eastern half of the empire where
the Jews lived, was Greek; the Greeks, though militarily weak,
had been culturally powerful, leaving their mark on Roman thinking
in everything from their language and theology, to their laws
and philosophy. If a person knew Greek, he could get along well
in the Roman Empire, just as today, if a person knows English,
he'll do better than a person who doesn't.
<P>
<B>Origin of the Bible</B> 
<P>
<I><B>Divine</B></I> 
<P>
The Bible had its origin with God, not with man.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Above all, you must understand that no prophecy of Scripture came
about by the prophet's own interpretation. For prophecy never
had its origin in the will of man, but men spoke from God as they
were carried along by the Holy Spirit. (2 Peter 1:20-21).
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<I><B>Inspiration</B></I> 
<P>
God inspired people to write the scriptures.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking,
correcting and training in righteousness, so that the man of God
may be thoroughly equipped for every good work. (2 Tim 3:16-17)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<I><B>Theories of Inspiration</B></I> 
<P>
<I>1.The mechanical or dictation theory</I> 
<P>
Some teach that God dictated the words of scripture to the various
authors, making them in essence secretaries or tape recorders.
A few passages (such as Exodus 20:1 and 31:18) do indicate that
God was dictating and expected his words to be copied verbatim.
Such a concept insures a very high regard for scripture, insuring
accuracy and completeness. However the variety of vocabulary and
style by the various authors seems to mitigate against this view,
because if God were dictating, then there should be a uniformity
of style, vocabulary and point of view - which simply is not the
case.
<P>
<I>2. Partial inspiration</I> 
<P>
The essence of this view may be summarized by stating that the
Bible &quot;contains the word of God.&quot; Especially, it is
believed that those sections of the Bible that are doctrinal in
nature are inspired, while merely history or whatever would not
be. The decision as to what is inspired or not is largely left
up to the individual to decide.
<P>
<I>3. Degrees of Inspiration</I> 
<P>
Closely related to the concept of partial inspiration is the concept
of degrees of inspiration. The bottom line is that some passages
in the Bible are more important than others
<P>
Inspiration was based on the following criteria:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
a. What every man knew - very little, if any inspiration needed.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
b. What involved special investigation - still little, if any
inspiration necessary.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
c. What could not otherwise be known. Those things that required
direct intervention by God are the only sections that can claim
to be inspired or God-breathed.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
This allows, then, for errors and is dependent upon human judgment
as to what is true.
<P>
<I>4. The concept, not the words inspired</I> 
<P>
This hypothesis attempts to conceive of thoughts apart from words;
that is, the concept being expressed by the words is what is without
error and inspired by God, not the actual words themselves.
<P>
<I>5. Natural inspiration</I> 
<P>
Just as the Egyptians excelled in geometry, so the Jews excelled
in religion; the inspiration of the Bible is the same as that
of any gifted author, and what we see in the Bible is merely human
genius at work. And of course, even genius is capable of error.
<P>
<I>6. Mystical inspiration</I> 
<P>
The truthfulness of the Bible depends on the subjective response
of the individual. It isn't what the Bible says, but what the
Bible says to an individual that is inspired. In this sense, then,
the Bible BECOMES the word of God to each person who reads it.
Therefore, our conscience, or the indwelling Holy Spirit, tests
every external revelation and evaluates it, and determines if
it is meaningful and true for the individual involved. Subjective
experience takes precedence over objective scripture.
<P>
<I>7. Verbal plenary inspiration</I> 
<P>
Evangelicals generally believe that inspiration is plenary, that
is, that it extends to the entire scripture, and verbal, that
it applies to the very words of the text, and not merely to the
ideas contained in them.
<P>
The extent of scripture:
<P>
2 Timothy 3:16 - &quot;All scripture...&quot;
<P>
2 Peter 3:16 - Peter states that Paul's writings are scripture.
<P>
1 Timothy 5:18 - Paul quotes from Deuteronomy 25:4 - &quot;Do
not muzzle the ox&quot; and Luke 10:7 &quot;for the laborer is
worthy of his hire&quot;, thereby equating the Gospel of Luke
with the Old Testament scriptures.
<P>
<B>Biblical Evidence for Inspiration and Inerrancy</B> 
<P>
1) 2 Timothy 3:16-17
<P>
2) Matthew 5:17-18
<P>
3) 2 Peter 1:20-21
<P>
4) John 10:34-35
<P>
<I>God's Words are True</I> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The law of Yahweh is perfect, reviving the soul.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The statutes of Yahweh are trustworthy, making wise the simple.
(Psalm 19:7)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Your righteousness is everlasting and your law is true. (Psalm
119:142)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I tell you the truth, until heaven and earth disappear, not the
smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means
disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished. (Matthew

<BLOCKQUOTE>
...an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of infants, because
you have in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth - (Romans

For the word of Yahweh is right and true; he is faithful in all
he does. (Psalm 33:4)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Sanctify them by the truth; your word is truth. (John 17:17)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Obviously, this involves circular reasoning; we are proving that
the Bible is inerrant by using the Biblical claims about itself.
However, if the Bible is assumed to be flawed, then obviously
it is lying about itself, not simply making unfortunate mistakes.
That would make the Bible even less trustworthy.
<P>
These verses are useful, however, if we already have the assumption
that the Bible is inerrant; also they can silence those critics
who might try to claim that the Bible nowhere claims to be without
error. Clearly, the sense of the above verses is quite clearly
that it is claiming to be without error.
<P>
<I>The Nature of God Suggests Inerrancy</I> 
<P>
We make the assumption that God is perfect; we further assume
that he wants to have a relationship with us and is concerned
to communicate with us accurately. Therefore, we make the assumption
that he has communicated with us, and that this communication
is contained in the Bible. Since it has its origin in a perfect
God, we thus assume it, too, is perfect. There are several biblical
passages which seem to suggest that this is the case.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<I>Reliability Necessitates It</I> 
<P>
If we are going to put our trust in the word of God, we have to
accept it as reliable; once we open up the possibility of errors
in the Bible, where do we stop? The story of the camel is perhaps
applicable: once you let it get its nose in the tent, the next
thing you know, you'll have the whole creature in there with you.
Or better, it is like censorship. Once you allow it, how do you
determine objective guidelines - and worse, who is going to have
the responsibility for drawing them up, and why? Can one be a
little bit pregnant? Or how do you decide when human life begins?
First trimester, second? Viability? What are the criteria? Is
it arbitrary?
<P>
A whole slew of possible analogies present themselves, none of
which is entirely perfect, but perhaps one can see the point.
The Bible is either true or it isn't; if it has errors, it is
hard to put much trust in it.
<P>
Of course the answer from those who do posit errors is that errors
are a matter of degree. That is, do we reject what the encyclopedia
says because we find a single mistake or two of minor quality?
Isn't the larger, overall picture still valid?
<P>
But take a book like<I> The Coming Economic Earthquake</I> by
Larry Burkett. Certainly its major point, that debt can be bad,
both for a country as well as for individuals is valid; nevertheless,
many of its assumptions and conclusions are overly simplistic
and wrong. More seriously, Burkett did a very poor job of research,
making many serious factual errors that cast questions about the
reliability in general of much of what he has to say. He has not
been faithful in small matters...
<P>
Five examples can serve to illustrate the problem.
<P>
<B>1. p. 27: </B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;Their spokesman for this New Deal was an articulate aristocrat
with a household family name: Roosevelt. Franklin Roosevelt was
born to wealth, raised to wealth, and educated in wealth at Harvard,
where he was exposed to the philosophies of Dr. John Maynard Keynes
of England. Keynes, an avowed socialist, had long advocated the
use of government control over banking and business to ensure
prosperity for all. This philosophy was not new. Karl Marx had
advocated essentially the same doctrine, only to a more radical
group - the poor.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
a. John Maynard Keynes was not a socialist. According to <I>the
Encycopaedia Britannica:</I> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
In Cambridge, to which Keynes now returned, his reputation was
rather different. He was quite simply esteemed as the most brilliant
student of Alfred Marshall and A.C. Pigou, the two Cambridge economists
who between them had produced the authoritative explanation of
how competitive markets functioned, business firms operated, and
consumers spent their incomes.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Although the tone of Keynes major writings in the 1920's was occasionally
skeptical, he did not directly challenge that conventional wisdom
of the period that held laissez-faire, only slightly tempered
by public policy, the best of all possible social arrangements.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
b. It is impossible that Roosevelt was influenced by Keynes in
Harvard because Keynes was born on June 5, 1883. Roosevelt was
born January 30, 1882. Roosevelt was <I>older </I>than Keynes,
and they were both in college about the same time. It seems unlikely
that Roosevelt would be studying the philosophy of someone who
was himself taking classes at the same time in Cambridge, from
firmly laissez-faire capitalist economic teachers - especially
when you consider that Keynes had yet to develop the economic
philosophy about which Burkett is so critical.
<P>
c. Keynes' book, in which he propounded his economic theory of
unemployment (Larry Burkett terribly misrepresents and apparently
doesn't understand Keynesian economics in the first place) was
called <I>The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money</I>,
which appeared in England at the very end of 1935. Roosevelt had
been elected president in 1932.
<P>
This is how the <I>Encyclopaedia Britannica</I> summarizes Keynes
argument in his book:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The central message is readily translated into two powerful propositions.
The first declared the existing theory of unemployment nonsense.
In a depression, according to Keynes, there was no wage so low
that it could eliminate unemployment. Accordingly, it was wicked
to blame the unemployed for their plight. The second proposition
proposed an alternative explanation about the origins of unemployment
and depression. This centered upon aggregate demand - i.e., the
total spending of consumers, business investors, and public agencies.
When aggregate demand was low, sales and jobs suffered. When it
was high, all was well.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
From these generalities there flowed a powerful and comprehensive
view of economic behaviour. Because consumers were limited in
their spending by the size of their incomes, they were not the
source of business cycle fluctuations. The dynamic actors were
business investors and governments. In depressions the thing to
do was either to enlarge private investment or to create public
substitutes for private investment deficiencies. In mild economic
contractions, monetary policy in the shape of easier credit and
lower interest rates just might stimulate business investment
and restore the aggregate demand caused by full employment. Severer
contractions required as therapy the sterner remedy of deliberate
public deficits either in the shape of public works or subsidies
to afflicted groups.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Whether Keynes is right or not is a separate issue. But Burkett's
presentation of him is far from accurate, therefore rendering
Burkett's conclusions very suspect.
<P>
<B>2. p. 72: </B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;It was assumed that by injecting a modest amount of new
currency into the economy, only a modest amount of inflation would
follow. Advocates of this plan assured the Kaiser that a modest
amount of inflation would be manageable and would actually allow
producers to reap more profits, thus helping to repay the Weimar
Republic's debts with cheaper currency.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
a. Germany did not have a Kaiser after World War I. How could
there be advisors to this non-existent person? Following World
War I, the Kaiser abdicated and moved to Holland, together with
his family. Before the rise of Hitler, Germany had a popularly
elected, democratic government.
<P>
<B>3. p. 165:</B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;This is what George Orwell described as 'government speak'
in his novel <I>1984</I>.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Orwell called it &quot;Newspeak&quot;.
<P>
<B>4. p. 166:</B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;Then in the sixties President Nixon substituted the use
of base metal coins for silver coins effectively removing all
fixed asset value from U.S. currency.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The coins were changed from silver to nickel/copper sandwiches
in 1965. Nixon did not take office as president until January,
1969.
<P>
<B>5. p. 198:</B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;Once the word was made public, investors outside the U.S.
rushed to convert their U.S. dollars into the E.C. Eurodollar,
adopted as the official world currency by virtually all members
of the World Economic Council, excluding the United States of
course.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Although Burkett is describing a fictionalized account of a possible
future crisis in 1999, what he is describing would be a remarkable
trick indeed, considering what Eurodollars are, according to the
<I>Encyclopaedia Britannica</I>:
<P>
Eurodollars, deposits of United States dollars in foreign banks
obligated to pay in U.S. dollars when the deposits are withdrawn.
<P>
In essence, Eurodollars are simply U.S. dollars that happen to
be in European banks. If Burkett's scenario took place, I suspect
the Europeans would find the Eurodollars just as worthless as
the U.S. dollars - since they are the same thing.
<P>
The sorts of errors that we find in Mr. Burkett's book are the
same sort of flaws that are postulated for the Bible. If we wouldn't
care to trust or read Larry Burkett's book, then why should we
accept the possibility of such errors in the Bible? The Bible
would then be just as worthless.
<P>
By its nature, a presupposition Geisler has pointed out the following
regarding the Bible and error:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
In summation, the denial of the inerrancy of Scripture is not
primarily a factual problem, though it has factual dimensions,
to be sure. The root problem of modern errancy is philosophical.
And the apostle Paul has urged us to &quot;demolish arguments
and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge
of God&quot; (2 Cor. 10:4, 5). In view of this it seems to me
that the best <I>refutation</I> of biblical errancy is a clear
<I>exposition </I>of the premises on which it is built, whether
these presuppositions be grounded in inductivism, materialism,
rationalism, or naturalism.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Hence, the rise of an errant view of Scripture did not result
from a discovery of factual evidence that made belief in an inerrant
Scripture untenable. Rather, it resulted from the unnecessary
acceptance of philosophical premises that undermined the historic
belief in an infallible and inerrant Bible.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The presupposition is either: the Bible is principally the work
of God, and therefore, because of the nature of God, without error.
Or, the Bible is primarily the work of human beings, and because
of the nature of human beings, inevitably with error.
