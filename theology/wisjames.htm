<P>
There is scarcely a page of the New Testament which does not contain
a quotation from, or allusion to, a text in the Old Testament.
If you take your Greek New Testament (NA 27) and thumb through
the pages you will discover that in the margins the editors have
indicated what they believe to be quotations or allusions from
the Old Testament, as well as parallel passages from the New Testament
and other literature. Sometimes they are right, and sometimes
they are wrong in their evaluations. Nevertheless what one discovers
in examining these putative allusions or quotations is that the
Old Testament is heard in the background of the entire New Testament
if one listens carefully; just as music is heard in the background
of modern movies. This &quot;theme music&quot; plays constantly
for the one who &quot;has ears to hear&quot;. The book of James
is no different in this respect. 
<P>
The purpose of this brief paper is to examine the allusions from
Old Testament wisdom literature that are found in James. Our procedure
will be quite simple: to examine the context of James in which
the allusion occurs and the attendant condition of the Old Testament
texts from which they are taken. We will then be in a position
to discover James' purpose in using these quotations and allusions.
<P>
The first allusion is found very early in the letter at 1:3: &quot;knowing
that the testing of your faith produces endurance&quot; which
alludes to Proverbs 27:21 (LXX): &quot;The crucible is for silver,
and the furnace is for gold, so a person is tested by being praised,
for the wise heart seeks knowledge.&quot;
<P>
It is clear that this qualifies as an allusion and not a quotation
simply because the idea found in Proverbs is alluded to by James
and expanded by him. In the clause in Proverbs fine metals and
human words have in common that they are tested and their value
demonstrated as the final result of the refining process. Just
as metals are exposed for what they are at the end of the smelting
process, so also are evil hearts made known by evil words.

<P>
It is my opinion that as James' readers encounter this allusion
they were drawn into the context of the source to such an extent
that they would have thought of the surrounding passages and their
meaning. Just as many of you, if hearing the phrase, &quot;Amazing
grace, how sweet the sound...&quot; will be drawn into the entire
song and hear the tune in your head. This, I take it, is true
of each allusion in the book of James.

<P>
James employs this allusion and maintains that faith is likewise
subjected tothat when this process is completed the result is
patience. Faith that is not fired through the smelting oven of
trials is not as pure as faith that has been refined by the fires
of distress, heartache, and troubles. James thus rightly sees
that trials are not efforts by God to destroy faith but to improve
it. It is my opinion that as James' readers encounter this allusion
they were drawn into the context of the source to such an extent
that they would have thought of the surrounding passages and their
meaning. Just as many of you, if hearing the phrase, &quot;Amazing
grace, how sweet the sound...&quot; will be drawn into the entire
song and hear the tune in your head. This, I take it, is true
of each allusion in the book of James.
<P>
The significance of this cannot be overlooked. For if the hearers
and readers of James heard the text quoted along with its context
then they would, it seems to me, be enabled to draw on the spiritual
riches of those texts and empowered to apply them to their own
situations. For after all, the whole purpose of wisdom literature
is to empower the wise to live the will of God in an evil world.
<P>
The next allusion is found in 1:5: &quot;If any of you is lacking
in wisdom, ask God, who gives to all generously and ungrudgingly,
and it will be given you,&quot; which alludes to Provergbs 2:3-6:
&quot;if you indeed cry out for insight, and raise your voice
for understanding; if you seek it like silver, and search for
it as for hidden treasures -- then you will understand the fear
of the Lord and find the knowledge of God. For the Lord gives
wisdom; from his mouth come knowledge and understanding.&quot;
<P>
If you lack wisdom, ask God for it, James urges his comrades.
Wisdom, then, is not attainable by mere human effort but is a
gift of God Himself. This also seems to be the meaning of the
Proverbs passage cho bestows wisdom on the seeker. But one caveat
is added; the seeker must desire wisdom more than he desires wealth
or material goods. Perhaps we hear an echo here of Solomon's prayer
at the dedication of the Temple in which he asked God for wisdom
above wealth and power. Perhaps, likewise, James hears an echo
here of the saying of Jesus which runs, &quot;seek first the kingdom
of God and His righteousness, and all these things will be yours
as well&quot;, which is as much as to say that the person who
lives wisely and obediently to God will lack nothing. James thus
uses this wisdom text to assure his readers that the foundation
of life must be set on the rock of God's wisdom.
<P>
Then we find in 1:11: &quot;For the sun rises with its scorching
heat and withers the field; its flower falls, and its beauty perishes.
It is the same waywith the rich; in the midst of a busy life,
they will wither away,&quot; which points us towards Job 14:2:
&quot;comes up like a flower and withers, flees like a shadow
and does not last.&quot;
<P>
Please notice that the first allusion James uses points
to the necessity of wisdom and its accessibility to those who
ask. In the second allusion wisdom is described as greater than
wealth. And now, in the third allusion James draws our attention
to the fact that those who trust in wealth will soon wither and
fade. The progression seems self evident- from the call to wisdom
to the explanation that wisdom is greater than wealth and now
to the fact that wealth itself is a dead end street which the
wise one does not travel. Is this not the very method of instruction
used by the wise in Israel's wisdom schools? It seems to me that
James is developing a pattern which is very well thought out and
very intentional. These are not haphazard allusions to the Old
Testament wisdom literature b ut evidence of a refinlying the
Old Testament text to the present situation by James.
<P>
Now that the preliminary injunctions which refer to the superiority
of wisdom over wealth are concluded, James turns to the practical
application of wisdom in the life of his community.
<P>
So we have in 1:19 &quot;You must understand this, my beloved:
let everyone be quick to listen, slow to speak, slow to anger&quot;,
where we are pointed towards Proverbs 15:1 &quot;A soft answer
turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger&quot;.
<P>
James first applies wisdom to an internal aspect; the right use
of the tongue and ear. It is a well established fact that the
Wisdom teachers of Ancient Israel were very interested in the
right use of the tongue. Here we have evidence that James was
at least familiar with that tradition and probably greatly influenced
by it.
<P>
When we come to chapter 2 we find in 2:6 &quot;But you have dishonored
the poor. Is it not the rich who oppress you? Is it not they who
drag you into court?&quot; which points us to Proverbs 14:21 &quot;Those
who despise their neighbors are sinners, but happy are those who
are kind to the poor&quot;.
<P>
This second application of wisdom is external; or, how does the
wise treat the poor? This, too, like the wisdom school's interest
in correct speech, was a high priority for the wise of Ancient
Israel.
<P>
Our next allusion does not come until 3:6 &quot;And the tongue
is a fire. The tongue is placed among our members as a world of
iniquity; it stains the whole body, sets on fire the cycle of
nature, and is itself set on fire by hell&quot;, which alludes
to Proverbs 16:27 &quot;Scoundrels concoct evil, and their speech
is li And now, in a brilliant move, James circles back to the
beginning and again discusses how the wise person makes use of
the tongue. Perhaps those acquainted with the literary device
known as parallelism could make a contribution here. At any rate,
James applies wisdom to speech, treatment of the poor, and again,
speech.
<P>
James will now, with his Old Testament allusions, move to another
application of wisdom to everyday life: humility. The wise soul
is the humble soul.
<P>
And so we find our next quotation at 4:6 &quot;But he gives all
the more grace; therefore it says, &quot;God opposes the proud,
but gives grace to the humble&quot;. which mirrors Proverbs 3:34
&quot;Toward the scorners he is scornful, but to the humble he
shows favor&quot;. Humility, like kindness towards the poor and
correct speech, was another &quot;pillar&quot; of wise behavior,
according to the Wise of Israel. James adopts this belief as well
and instructs his community to behave humbly, as well as speak
rightly and act kindly.
<P>
To recap to this point: James begins his use of allusions with
the call to wisdom. He then describes the superiority of wisdom
over wealth. Then he turns to the application of wisdom in everyday
life in speech, hearing, treatment of the poor, and speech. He
next procedes to consider the fact that those who live wisely
also live humbly. And now he will tell his readers that life must
be lived under the Lordship of God in trust and obedience.
<P>
This is what we find in chapter 4:14 &quot;Yet you do not even
know what tomorrow will bring. What is your life? For you are
a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes&quot;
which alludes to Proverbs 27:1 &quot;Do not boast about tomorrow,
for you do not know what a day may bring&quot;.es each day in
the certain knowledge that God oversees his activities.
<P>
And now, another move which brings us back to the beginning of
the discussion and points us away from riches and back towards
God. In 5:2 we have &quot;Your riches have rotted, and your clothes
are moth-eaten&quot;. which alludes to Job 13:2 &quot;One wastes
away like a rotten thing, like a garment that is moth-eaten&quot;.
<P>
Lets look at our next text. 5:11 Says; &quot;Indeed we call blessed
those who showed endurance. You have heard of the endurance of
Job, and you have seen the purpose of the Lord, how the Lord is
compassionate and merciful&quot; alluding to Job 1:21-22 &quot;He
said, &quot;Naked I came from my mother's womb, and naked shall
I return there; the Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away; blessed
be the name of the Lord.&quot; 22 In all this Job did not sin
or charge God with wrongdoing&quot;.
<P>
When the wise person is confronted with difficulties in life,
he or she is not brought to a point of unbelief. Instead, their
wise faith injects itself into the situation and they are enabled
to overcome any difficulty. That is what endurance is; and real
endurance is available only to faith.
<P>
And lastly, 5:20 &quot;you should know that whoever brings back
a sinner from wandering will save the sinner's soul from death
and will cover a multitude of sins&quot; which alludes to Proverbs
10:12 &quot;Hatred stirs up strife, but love covers all offenses&quot;.
This text is a concluding note on the value of love. When one
loves another, one does not ignore their difficulties or errors;
one does his or her best to correct those errors.
<P>
It seems to me that James is circling thethese ideas unnecessarily-
instead he is reiterating in quite poetic fashion the most important
issues of wisdom in daily life. If I may be allowed to set this
out diagrammatically:
<P>
<blockquote>A 1:3- Faith is tested.
<P>
<blockquote>B 1:5- Faith Seeks Wisdom
<P>
<blockquote>C 1:11- Wisdom is More valuable than Gold
<P>
<blockquote>D 1:19, 2:6, 3:6, 4:14, The application of Wisdom to Daily Life</blockquote>
<P>
C' 5:2- Wisdom is More valuable than Gold</blockquote>
<P>
B' 5:11- Faith Acts Wisely (because it has sought wisdom and found it)</blockquote>
<P>
A' 5:20 Faith is Active (because, having been tested, it is victorious)</blockquote>

<P>
I don't think that this schematic is artificial; rather I think
it demonstrates a clear intention on the part of James to communicate
the central position of ethical behavior as the result of real
wisdom. More than that, I take these allusions to Old Testament
wisdom to be the organinzing principle of this epistle.
<P>
By way of conclusion let me say that when we take the time to
examine the allusions and quotations of the Old Testament in the
New we find not proof texting, as is sometimes claimed, but excellent
theological insight into the meaning of the Old Testament text
exhibited by the New Testament writers. The book of James is no
exception to this rule. His utilization of the Wisdom literature
for the benefit of the young Church (for like Schlatter, I take
James to date from the 40's) is an effort to apply the wisdom
of God to the grind of daily life.
