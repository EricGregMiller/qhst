/It is unclear what the gender of Spirit may be, since there is

and so the verb immediately following it is also feminine; however,
the next verb is masculine, referring apparently back to whom
the hand belongs, i.e. God.  The hand does not act apart from
God.  It has a subservient role.  Those places, perhaps, where
Spirit APPEARS masculine, may be functioning in the same relationship
as this hand./

<P>
 Who has understood the Spirit of Yahweh, or instructed Him as

Yahweh', or may refer back to Yahweh]
<P>
 After a study of the use of <I>ruah</I> in the rest of the Old
Testament, there seems to be no pattern to its use as a masculine:
it is apparently a free variable.  This seems clear even from
just its divine use, where in the same books of the Bible where
an occasional masculine use of <I>ruah</I> surfaces, we find it
is overwhelmingly used as a feminine.  It is reasonable to conclude
based on this general feminine usage that the Spirit of God was
felt to be feminine by the writers of Scripture.  The New Testament
usage of the neuter for the Spirit does not preclude this possibility.
 
<P>
 Preliminary indications are that the percentage of times the
Spirit of God is masculine is about the same percentage as it
is for the occurrence of the word <I>ruah</I> throughout the OT.
<P>
 Actual breakdown:
<P>
 9 out of 89 occurrences of the Spirit of God are masculine.
<P>
 44 out of 373 occurrences of spirit (of whatever sort) are masculine.<P>
9/89 = 10.1 % masculine
<P>
 44/373 = 11.8 % masculine
<P>
 Spirit, when used as a masculine, seems to have the sense of
either &quot;wind&quot; or &quot;emotion, attitude&quot;.  If
it refers to the breath, or life force, the spirit, then it is
feminine.  The feminine can perhaps sometimes mean &quot;wind&quot;
or &quot;emotion, attitude&quot;, but the masculine, I would propose, can never
mean &quot;spirit&quot; or &quot;breath&quot;.
