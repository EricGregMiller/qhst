<B>F. What is the Value of Knowledge?</B>
<P>
What is the value of knowing things? How does knowledge affect
theology? Is it important that we know anything? Should knowledge
be understood as being limited to only knowledge of God and the
Bible?
<P>
<I><B>1. Wisdom in the Bible</B></I> 
<P>
Wisdom is a theme which runs deep and wide throughout God's word.
Perhaps the first thing which must be made clear is that in Old
Testament thought, little, if any, distinction is made between
the words &quot;knowledge&quot; and &quot;wisdom&quot;. In modern
thinking, at least for the educated, &quot;wisdom&quot; has the
meaning of &quot;applied knowledge&quot;. The dictionary defines
it as the &quot;ability to discern inner qualities and relationships&quot;
or &quot;a wise attitude or course of action.&quot; Knowledge,
on the other hand, is simply &quot;accumulated information&quot;,
without the implication of truly understanding and making use
of it. Perhaps the distinction can best be illustrated with a
story:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
A little girl from the backwoods of West Virginia entered the
first grade with no understanding of how to speak standard English.
Her teacher, a woman educated at New York University, took upon
herself the task of correcting this little girl's language. Weeks
passed, but no improvement was apparent in her speech patterns.
Exasperated, the teacher asked to speak with her briefly after
school. &quot;How is it,&quot; demanded the teacher, &quot;that
after all these weeks in school you still don't know how to speak
decent English?&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;Oh, but I does know how,&quot; she said.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;Then why do you insist on talking like that?&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;You asked if I <I>knows</I> how. You didn't say nothin'
'bout <I>speakin'</I> how.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Now if the teacher and the little girl had been Hebrew speakers,
there would have been no such misunderstanding. According to Hebrew
thought, the little girl would not <I>know</I> how to speak standard
English, since she doesn't do it. For the Hebrew mind-set of the
Bible, all knowledge that is known is expressed, else it isn't
known. Thus wisdom is the sum of a person's knowledge. In the
Old Testament (as in the New), the value of knowing - of being
wise - is of greatest value. Job 28 is a classic expression of
this attitude:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
There is a mine for silver
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
and a place where gold is refined.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Iron is taken from the earth,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
and copper is smelted with ore.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Man puts an end to the darkness;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
he searches the farthest recesses
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
for ore in the blackest darkness.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Far from where people dwell he cuts a shaft,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
in places forgotten by the foot of man;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
far from men he dangles and sways.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The earth, from which food comes,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
is transformed below as by fire;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
sapphires come from its rocks,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
and its dust contains nuggets of gold.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
No bird of prey knows that hidden path,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
no falcon's eye has seen it.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Proud beasts do not set foot on it,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
and no lion prowls there.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Man's hand assaults the flinty rock
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
and lays bare the roots of the mountains.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
He tunnels through the rock;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
his eyes see all its treasures.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
He searches the sources of the rivers
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
and brings hidden things to light.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
But where can wisdom be found?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Where does understanding dwell?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Man does not comprehend its worth;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
it cannot be found in the land of the living.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The deep says, &quot;It is not in me&quot;;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
the sea says, &quot;It is not with me.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
It cannot be bought with the finest gold,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
nor can its price be weighed in silver.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
It cannot be bought with the gold of Ophir,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
with precious onyx or sapphires.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Neither gold nor crystal can compare with it,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
nor can it be had for jewels of gold.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Coral and jasper are not worthy of mention;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
the price of wisdom is beyond rubies.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The topaz of Cush cannot compare with it;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
it cannot be bought with pure gold.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Where then does wisdom come from?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Where does understanding dwell?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
It is hidden from the eye of every living thing,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
concealed even from the birds of the air. Destruction and Death
say,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;Only a rumor of it has reached our ears.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
God understands the way to it
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
and he alone knows where it dwells,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
for he views the ends of the earth
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
and sees everything under the heavens. When he established the
force of the wind
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
and measured out the waters,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
when he made a decree for the rain
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
and a path for the thunderstorm,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
then he looked at wisdom and appraised it;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
he confirmed it and tested it.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
And he said to man,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;The fear of the Lord -
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
that is wisdom,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
and to shun evil is understanding.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Wisdom is described as an extremely valuable and desirable commodity,
beyond compare or price. It is not an object which can be picked
up at the corner dime store, nor something that can be mined out
of the ocean depths (vs. 14). It is not something which can be
located without help. Rather, wisdom is a gift of God. James writes:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If any of you lacks wisdom, he should ask God, who gives generously
to all without finding fault, and it will be given to him. (James
1:5)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
At the end of Job 28, in the last verse, it is recorded that &quot;The
fear of the Lord - that is wisdom; and to shun evil is understanding.&quot;
Does this verse teach the Christian that the <I>sum</I> of knowledge
and wisdom is the fear of God, or that <I>all</I> a person needs
to know about is &quot;Yahweh&quot;? Probably not. Notice Proverbs
1:7:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The fear of Yahweh is the <I>beginning</I> of knowledge,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
but fools despise wisdom and discipline. (emphasis added)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
At least five passages in Proverbs associate wisdom with the fear
of Yahweh (1:7, 29; 2:5; 8:12-14; and 15:33). Wisdom cannot exist
apart from the source of wisdom. The first principle of wisdom
is the fear of God. It is here that wisdom begins, and it is around
this hub that all else revolves. But this fear of God in no way
excludes the desire to know and gain knowledge of the universe
around us. It is recorded in 1 Kings 3:7-13 that Solomon asked
for wisdom. And God gave it to him. In 1 Kings 4:29- 34 his wisdom
is described:
<P>
God gave Solomon wisdom and very great insight, and a breadth
of understanding as measureless as the sand on the seashore. Solomon's
wisdom was greater than the wisdom of all the wisdom of Egypt.
He was wiser than any other man, including Ethan the Ezrahite
- wiser than Heman, Calcol and Darda, the sons of Mahol. And his
fame spread to all the surrounding nations. He spoke three thousand
proverbs and his songs numbered a thousand and five. He described
plant life, from the cedar of Lebanon to the hyssop that grows
out of walls. He also taught about animals and birds, reptiles
and fish. Men of all nations came to listen to Solomon's wisdom,
sent by all the kings of the world, who had heard of his wisdom.
<P>
<B>G. Can We Know Too Much?</B> 
<P>
In the world at large, and among many Christians in particular,
a very peculiar dogma has arisen: &quot;There are some things
in the universe that people just shouldn't know, or shouldn't
mess with.&quot; This dogma has been a theme in much popular literature,
from Frankenstein to the latest horror movie. Item: An episode
of <I>Twilight Zone </I>shown on CBS shortly after the Challenger
disaster showed a scientist awakening in a distant future, in
a time when machines are virtually outlawed. Instead, the mind
is used to manipulate the world. But a danger has arisen that
can be solved only by making use of the long forbidden nuclear
weapons. The people of this time convince the scientist that an
asteroid is approaching the Earth and will crash into it, and
only a nuclear explosion can stop it. But at the last minute,
when it is too late to stop, he discovers it is not an asteroid,
but rather a spaceship filled with people from his own time. They
are destroyed so that they cannot contaminate the world with the
knowledge of nuclear weapons and other evil machines. He ultimately
recognizes the &quot;wisdom&quot; of this, and approves.
<P>
<I>Item:</I> 
<P>
A class in a small Christian college is dismayed at the thought
of artificial insemination and genetic engineering. &quot;We're
playing God. It shouldn't be allowed.&quot;
<P>
<I>Item:</I> 
<P>
A well-known tele-evangelist and his colleagues expressed dismay
at the thought that students in some Christian colleges were taught
to probe, question, and inquire about the Bible, and were exposed
to more than one possible interpretation for a given passage.
Shockingly, the students were actually taught to debate theological
positions!
<P>
Why this fear of knowledge and free inquiry? Biblically, there
is only one thing that the human race should never have known:
sin. Outside of that, everything is permissible. God has never
forbidden knowledge. Instead, the Bible - particularly the Old
Testament - stresses the desirability of it. God doesn't want
ignorance.
<P>
Yet, many think that if you know too much, you will then turn
your back on God. After all, it is the scientists, and the theologians,
and the colleges that are turning people away from God. &quot;You
know too much, and you'll deny God.&quot; Such thoughts are challenged
by what Charles Dickens wrote in <I>Christmas Carol:</I> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
They were a boy and a girl. Yellow, meagre, ragged, scowling,
wolfish; but prostrate, too, in their humility...
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Scrooge started back, appalled. Having them shown to him in this
way, he tried to say they were fine children, but the words choked
themselves, rather than be parties to a lie of such enormous magnitude.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;Spirit! are they yours?&quot; Scrooge could say no more.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;They are Man's,&quot; said the Spirit, looking down upon
them. &quot;And they cling to me, appealing from their fathers.
This boy is Ignorance. This girl is Want. Beware them both and
all of their degree, but most of all beware this boy, for on his
brow I see that written which is Doom, unless the writing be erased.
Deny it!&quot; cried the Spirit, stretching out its hand towards
the city. &quot;Slander those who tell it ye! Admit it for your
factious purposes, and make it worse. And bide the end!&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
How can a person know too much? Where does the Bible condemn wisdom
and knowledge? How does a fear of <I>knowing </I>reconcile itself
with Proverbs 1:22?
<BLOCKQUOTE>
How long will you simple ones love your simple ways?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
How long will mockers delight in mockery
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
and fools hate knowledge?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Or how do those who argue that we can know too much reconcile
their anti-intellectualism with Proverbs 8:1-11?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Does not wisdom call out?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Does not understanding raise her voice?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
On the heights along the way,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
where the paths meet, she takes her stand;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
beside the gates leading into the city,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
at the entrances, she cries aloud:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;To you, O men, I call out;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I raise my voice to all mankind.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
You who are simple, gain prudence;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
you who are foolish, gain understanding.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Listen, for I have worthy things to say;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I open my lips to speak what is right.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
My mouth speaks what is true,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
for my lips detest wickedness.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
All the words of my mouth are just;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
none of them is crooked or perverse.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
To the discerning all of them are right;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
they are faultless to those who have knowledge.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Choose my instruction instead of silver,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
knowledge rather than choice gold,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
for wisdom is more precious than rubies,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
and nothing you desire can compare with her....&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
All the words of wisdom's mouth are just; to the discerning everything
she says is right. To those who have knowledge, the ways of wisdom
are faultless. Verses 34-36 go on to say:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Blessed is the man who listens to me,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
watching daily at my doors,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
waiting at my doorway.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
For whoever finds me finds life
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
and receives favor from Yahweh.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
But whoever fails to find me harms himself;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
all who hate me love death.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The Bible is unequivocal in stating that those who despise knowledge,
who wish to remain ignorant, are fools on their way to death.
Those anti-intellectuals teaching &quot;Be-ware, lest you know
too much&quot;, are fools. Don't think that it is only Bible knowledge
that is in view in these passages. Solomon's wisdom is described
not just in his fear for God, but in the practical matters of
life, and in the esoteric matters of natural history: biology
and botany. He was a man of letters and art. To think that for
some reason God wants Christians to be ignorant, or that we are
to be &quot;uncultured barbarians&quot; is certainly unscriptural
and dangerous.
<P>
Daniel 1:17 records that &quot;To these four young men God gave
knowledge and understanding of all kinds of literature and learning....&quot;
No limits were placed on what they could learn. They were good
students, even in a pagan culture; they knew the literature of
a polytheistic society. God never said &quot;You don't want to
learn about that; you can't know that.&quot; Instead, it says
that God himself gave the knowledge and understanding for it.
God is the source of learning and of knowledge, as the other verses
have shown.
<P>
<B>H. Wisdom and the Two Revelations of God </B>
<P>
What anti-intellectuals sometimes forget is that God's revelation
of himself is not limited to the Bible. Rather, his word makes
clear that the natural world around us is also a revelation of
himself:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The heavens declare the glory of God;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
the skies proclaim the work of his hands.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Day after day they pour forth speech;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
night after night they display knowledge.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
There is no speech or language
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
where their voice is not heard.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Their voice goes out into all the earth,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
their words to the ends of the world.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
(Psalm 19:1-4)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Other passages dealing with natural revelation are Psalm 92:1-6
and Psalm 104. God's revelation is the universe around us just
as much as the Bible. Everything should be open to study and learning,
for in studying about the world around us we can also learn about
God. Both the study of nature and the study of the Bible are legitimate
and Christ-honoring goals for the Christian. An insatiable curiosity
is a gift from God. No branch of knowledge is out-of-bounds. All
can be used to the glory of God:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The earth is the Lord's, and everything in it,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
the world, and all who live in it;...
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
(Psalm 24:1)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for
the glory of God. (1 Cor. 10:31)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
If we can maintain the attitude of submission to God, and at all
times wish to bring honor and glory to him, then we needn't be
afraid of knowledge - only its abuse. Atomic energy can power
a city or destroy it. Genetic engineering can cure disease, produce
NutrasweetTM, or it could be used to produce a deadly disease.
In vitro fertilization makes it possible for childless couples
to have children, or it can be used to build a Brave New World
- a parentless society. But to oppose research from the fear of
the possible evil to which it might be put is irresponsible. Genesis
1:26-28 records:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Then God said, &quot;Let us make man in our image, in our likeness,
and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the
air, over the livestock, over all the Earth, and over all the
creatures that move along the ground.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
So God created man in his own image,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
in the image of God he created him;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
male and female he created them.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
God blessed them and said to them, &quot;Be fruitful and increase
in number; fill the Earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish of
the sea and the birds of the air and over every living creature
that moves on the ground.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Genesis 2:15 records:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to
work it and take care of it.

Notice Psalm 8:
<BLOCKQUOTE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
the son of man that you are mindful of him?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
You made him a little lower than God
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
and crowned him with glory and honor.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
You made him ruler over the works of your hands;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
you put everything under his feet:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
all flocks and herds,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
and the beasts of the field,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
the birds of the air,

<BLOCKQUOTE>
all that swim the paths of the seas.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
how majestic is your name in all the Earth!

<P>
That human beings &quot;play God&quot; should not be surprising,
nor is it necessarily evil, since we are, after all, created in
God's image. The world, according to the record of Genesis and
Psalms, is <I>ours</I>. We are to subdue it, and rule it, and
we are to rule the other living creatures of the planet. To do
this right, it is necessary to fully understand all that God has
made.
<P>
<B>I. Secular vs. Religious</B> 
<P>
Perhaps one of the problems facing the anti-intellectuals of Christendom
is the desire to separate life into the religious and the non-religious
(don't confuse this with the question of separation of Church
and State, which very clearly is a New Testament principle). We
can thank the Middle Ages for much of this sort of thinking. From
the Biblical perspective, all aspects of existence are essentially
religious. One cannot escape from the presence or influence of
God (cf. Jonah and Psalm 139). Whether awake or asleep, working
or playing, everything is to be done for God (cf. Deut. 6 and
Titus 1:15). Worship is not something done only on Sunday in a
building called a church. Worship is something that can be done
at all times, in any situation. Worshiping God involves doing
what is right, doing the will of God (cf. Isaiah 1:15-17). In
Deuteronomy 6:20 God commands human beings to work. Look at what
the reformer John Calvin had to say about human labor:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
It is to be remarked that the Lord commands every one of us, in
all the actions of life, to regard his vocation. For he knows
with what great disquietude the human mind is inflamed, with what
desultory levity it is hurried hither and thither, and how insatiable
is its ambition to grasp different things at once. Therefore,
to prevent universal confusion from being produced by our folly
and temerity, he has appointed to all their particular duties
in different spheres of life. And that no one might rashly transgress
the limits prescribed, he has styled such spheres of life vocations,
or callings. Every individual's line of life, therefore, is, as
it were, a post assigned to him by the Lord, that he may not wander
about in uncertainty all his days...It is sufficient if we know
that the principle and foundation of right conduct in every case
is the vocation of the Lord, and that he who disregards it will
never keep the right way in the duties of his station. He may
sometimes, perhaps, achieve something apparently laudable; but
however it may appear in the eyes of men, it will be rejected
at the throne of God; besides which there will be no consistency
between the various parts of life.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
In Genesis 2:15 God told people to cultivate and care for the
Garden of Eden. God also told Adam to name all the animals. It
is reasonable to state that labor and the knowledge necessary
to subdue the creation of God, is a holy calling from God. The
whole created order was made by God for the use and pleasure of
the human race, so as to bring glory to God. Therefore the universe
is ours to study.

<B>J. What About Accommodation?</B> 
<P>
For many years, people looked at their world, and believed it
to be flat, with edges over which they might fall. It is now known
that the Earth is not flat, and that it is not possible to fall
off the edge. The world is a sphere (roughly), and gravity pulls
everything on the surface toward the center of that sphere. That
we have come to this conclusion, altering the interpretation of
the reality around us, does not speak ill of us. We have advanced
and we know more. Scientists are not &quot;reading into&quot;
the universe something odd that wasn't really there. They rather
simply recognize what was there all along.
<P>
Likewise, when the Bible is reinterpreted, it is not an admission
by the reinterpreters that there was something wrong with the
text, nor does it mean that something is being &quot;read into&quot;
it that is odd or wasn't there to begin with. It simply means
that we recognize now what was there all along.
<P>
In the study of both revelations, advance is inevitable. We are
ignorant; changes in the interpretation of the Bible are as inevitable,
and no more dangerous, than changes in the interpretation of the
universe around us.
<P>
Copernicus suspected that one source of potential opposition to
his book, <I>On The Revolutions of the Heavenly Orbs,</I> might
come from Christians who perceived it as a challenge to the authority
of Holy Writ. They would, he feared, confuse their <I>interpretation
</I>of Scripture with what the Bible actually taught. We must
be careful not to do this. Humility with the text is very important.
Our interpretations are not God's word, and therefore they may
or may not be an accurate reflection of scripture.
<P>
A practical example of a failure to understand what the Bible
is and is not, and the difference between interpretation and reality,
can be shown from a freshman college student's paper:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Evolutionists would seemingly view theistic evolution as 1) an
admittance on the part of Christianity that the Bible is lacking
in its explanation of man's existence and &quot;needs help;&quot;
2) since the Bible &quot;needs help&quot; in this area, it may,
therefore, not be the inerrant stronghold that these same Christians
claim it to be.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
First, theistic evolution is based too much on supposition. The
Bible does not allude to the long periods of time that evolution
requires. For Christians to add to the facts presented - an act
forbidden by God - gives all the more support to the evolutionists'
bad habit of unsubstantiated linkages.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Secondly, as Lightner points out, theistic evolution is a concession
to the evolutionists. This meeting in the middle might as well
be printed on a banner with the phrase, &quot;We really aren't
sure that the Bible is as sound as it should be.&quot; Psalm 33:9,
however, should be quite satisfying to any Christian who takes
the Bible as God's absolute truth: He spoke and it was done; He
commanded and it stood fast.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
It would take too much time to go into all the logical fallacies
and misstatements contrary to fact in these three paragraphs.
The main point to notice is the student's misperception of the
Bible. She believes the Bible is <I>complete</I> revelation, rather
than what it actually is: <I>sufficient</I> revelation. The Bible
does not give us an exhaustive account of reality. It tells us
simply what we need to know about God and his dealings with people
- not all that we might want to know.
<P>
In this freshman's words, we can see an underlying fear of knowledge;
she expresses the thought that if something is not in the Bible,
then it is forbidden to us. There is also, quite evidently, a
failure on her part to understand that what the Bible actually
says and what our interpretation of it is, may not be identical.
The theistic evolutionary viewpoint is not a &quot;concession&quot;
to science (as if science were an enemy!), nor is it an admission
of weakness: rather, it is simply an attempt to make sense of
the biblical data as it relates to the data from natural revelation.
<P>
Certainly, we are free to disagree with theistic evolution, and
we may argue (if that is how we feel) that it does not make good
sense of the biblical or natural data; but it is not legitimate
to condemn it as somehow traitorous to Christianity or to argue
that it necessarily weakens or undermines the truth of the Bible.
<P>
<B>K. Natural vs. Supernatural </B>
<P>
About four hundred years before the time of Christ a philosopher
named Plato (427 - 347 BC) developed a dualistic philosophy of
the ideal and the real. He argued that mind had an independent
reality, and that a distinction exists between the ideal object
in the mind of God, and the reality we experience. In fact, Plato
argues that the ideal in the mind of God is the only reality,
with the objects of the material plane mere shadows by comparison.
<P>
As a result, Greek philosophy developed a deep distrust of matter
and a corresponding love for the immaterial or spiritual. Then,
since this Greek philosophy bore a superficial resemblance to
their concepts of the spiritual, some Christians later accepted
Platonism and incorporated it into their theological system. Thus,
Gnosticism was ultimately born; it vilified the material as corrupt
and sinful, in contrast to the spiritual which it saw as good
and wonderful.
<P>
Though regarded as a heresy in many of its details, during the
Middle Ages the Church came to accept the basic gnostic concept
of a good spirit and bad matter as if it were divine truth. Not
surprisingly, Christians increasingly came to emphasize the importance
of the hereafter - to the denigration of the here and now. The
practical out workings of this Gnosticism were the growing distinction
made between work for the church and secular employment, the consequent
separation between clergy and laity, and the development of monasticism.
A wall had grown up between the realm of God and the realm of
man. And only the realm of God really mattered. Then the Renaissance
arrived.
<P>
With the Renaissance - the rebirth of humanity - the masses, but
especially the elite, reacted at last against this otherworldliness
in Christianity; but the impact of the rebirth of humanity on
the Church was simply to increase the dichotomy between this world
and the next - so much so that the subsequent abdication of the
natural realm to the secularists became permanent in the Church.
Christianity would content itself with the spiritual and mysterious
workings of God. To the secularists could go the mundane things
of the world.
<P>
The Reformation - which arrived at about the same time -was a
reaction to <I>theological</I> faults in the medieval church and
a rejection of the hierarchical church structure; the reformers
recognized that all Christians were equal and that any employment
could be God honoring; suddenly there ceased to be a value distinction
- at least theoretically - between a pastor and, for instance,
a farmer.
<P>
Unfortunately, this rejection of dualism during the Reformation
went no further than the job market, and in the end even that
small victory did not stick. The natural realm, though recognized
as beautiful - and the here and now, though recognized as important,
remained - fundamentally - separated from the &quot;spiritual&quot;
realm.
<P>
As the split between the Church - whether Catholic or Protestant
- and the secular world increased, the spiritual world lost ground
and shrank. What had, in times past, been recognized as the mysterious
workings of God, became relegated to the &quot;mundane&quot;.
Since science could explain what had previously been the hand
of God in the world, it became acceptable to recognize that God,
in reality, had nothing to do with the day-to-day functioning
of the universe. Removal of &quot;mystery&quot; became the removal
of deity. Increasingly it seemed that God was nowhere to be found.
<P>
Christians clung desperately to those few questions still without
answers, but as those questions were answered, their footholds
were lost. With the so called God-of-the-gaps theology in full
bloom, the unknown was God only until it became known; after that,
God wasn't there after all. The realm of God shrank, and with
it, so did God.
<P>
What has happened? Today, religion and religious thought are relegated
to a no man's land of mysticism and subjectivism, a place where
God is somehow less than real, with an existence only as men define
Him. Even conservative Christians, who hold to an inerrant scripture
and believe in a born again experience, relegate miracles to the
past, when &quot;God was doing things differently than he does
now&quot; - a theological reaction to the shrinking of God's domain
brought about by secularization and modernism, not biblical exegesis.
Whether expressed or not, God's reality and power shrank to become
nothing more than &quot;God helps those who help themselves.&quot;
Not surprisingly, some Christians - perhaps most - have become
terrified of science and learning, fearing that the last few wisps
of their faith are about to be forever yanked from under them
when the last mysteries are explained and understood. Modern science
looks out at the universe and finds little if any room for God,
so small has He shrunk in the minds of Christians.
<P>
The fundamental flaw - or heresy, if you will - has been the separation
(and the acceptance of this separation) of the natural and supernatural
according to Platonic and related thoughts. This heresy has resulted
in the belief, current among most, that miracles are &quot;violations&quot;
of natural law, when God &quot;rarely&quot; intervenes directly
in the life of his universe. Modern Christianity has become almost
deistic, thinking that those things we understand, those things
we can do, those things that we can predict and those things that
therefore are natural and ordinary, have nothing to do with God,
except that he started it all up, sometime long ago. God is simply
the clock winder and builder, but everything works by itself now.
&quot;We must work out our own salvation and live our own lives.
It's all up to us!&quot;
<P>
When the Bible speaks of God actively orchestrating the birth
process, the weather, the feeding of animals, and all the rest,
the tendency is to understand it as simply poetic rather than
real.
<P>
Instead, we should recognize that the concept of &quot;natural&quot;
in the Platonic sense of &quot;separate from divine intervention&quot;
is fallacious. That we understand how God does many of the wonders
of this universe doesn't mean that God isn't involved. He most
assuredly is.

<P>
The distinction between &quot;supernatural&quot; and &quot;natural&quot;
in the universe is an artificial distinction that really isn't
there. Instead, <I>everything</I> is supernatural. It is the &quot;natural&quot;
- in the sense of a universe operating without God's direct, immediate
intervention - that doesn't exist.
<P>
Secularists have said &quot;there is no supernatural&quot;. Christians
must respond, not by saying, &quot;yes, the supernatural also
exists,&quot; but by insisting, &quot;there is no natural!&quot;
Nothing happens apart from God.
<P>
<B>K. Problems That Have Developed from the Acceptance of a &quot;Natural&quot;
World</B> 
<P>
1. Degradation of the &quot;miraculous&quot;, not because of the
proper &quot;testing of the spirits&quot;, but because miracles
are viewed as inherently &quot;irrational&quot; and therefore
disreputable. This derives from a false idea that miracle means
&quot;violation of natural law&quot;, rather than &quot;God's
intervention&quot;. All of life is a miracle.
<P>
2. The concept that God will handle the &quot;big things&quot;
- that is, those items I don't understand or those that seem to
be beyond my capabilities or control. This is the &quot;God helps
those who help themselves&quot; approach.
<P>
3. Consequently, there is a tendency to rely on self rather than
the omnipresent and indwelling Holy Spirit, a lessening reliance
on grace, increasing legalism, and a tendency to take credit for
the good in our lives - i.e. &quot;self-righteousness&quot;. We
fail to recognize that all the good we do is from the hand of
God. As a Christian, I am simply a chosen vessel molded and put
to work by God. Apart from him, I am miserable, wretched, blind
and doomed to destruction. Yet, &quot;I can do everything through
him who gives me strength.&quot; (Phil. 4:13)
<BLOCKQUOTE>
For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith - and this
not from yourselves, it is the gift of God - not by works,so that
no one can boast. For we are God's workmanship, created in Christ
Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to
do. (Ephesians 2:8-10)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
4. Anti-intellectual tendencies are prevalent because of a unnecessary
tension between &quot;special&quot; and &quot;general&quot; revelation.
The thought exists that if it isn't in the Bible, it doesn't matter
or isn't important - with a subsequent denigration of literature,
art, philosophy, and science, despite the fact that these are
all part of &quot;general&quot; revelation.
<P>
5. God is viewed as completely incomprehensible - &quot;Wholly
Other&quot;.
<P>
The strange idea develops that &quot;if we can understand it,
then it isn't God.&quot;
<P>
6. Technophobia blossoms, and Christians become fearful of using
modern technology or even modern medicine because they think &quot;human&quot;
methods betray a lack of faith, as if God had nothing to do with
the development of modern technology, and he is incapable of using
it - or more than that, that he has nothing to do with the fact
it works at all!

The Christian is responsible for knowing and understanding the
Bible. Each individual stands before God as a priest, not needing
any human intermediary. This is both a great privilege as well
as a great responsibility.

Therefore it is important that the Christian be able to handle
the Bible correctly; it will save him or her a world of problems.

<B>Study Bibles From Hell</B> 
<P>
The title of this section sounds like something that belongs on
a horror flick, but no movie could ever be so insidious. Nothing
has ever worked so well at quenching the Spirit of God and closing
the mind than the omnipresent Study Bible. Notice the words of
Charles Caldwell Ryrie, ThD, PhD in his &quot;To The Reader&quot;
at the front of the Bible that bears his name:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Every time you read this Bible, whether carefully or casually,
be sure to look at the notes at the bottom of the page. These
are designed to illuminate and help you understand the verses
you are reading. The notes provide a variety of helps ... some
define ... doctrines ....
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
When you wish to study a book of the Bible more systematically,
you will want to read the Introduction to that book, which will
give you information about the author, background, and contents.
A unique feature of this Bible is the outline of each book printed
at the end of each Introduction and also interspersed throughout
the text. In this way you can readily see as you are reading through
a book exactly where you are in the development of the ideas of
that book by simply referring to the complete outline in the Introduction.
The Introductions will help lead you into the messages of the
books; the outlines will help you see the development of the messages;
and the notes will help shed light on the messages ....

&quot;Come, let me take the place of the Holy Spirit: I will tell
you what to think, how to believe; I have the Truth and I will
reveal it to you.&quot; Though I don't seriously believe Dr. Ryrie
set about to quench the Holy Spirit or to narrow the minds of
his readers, his words would have been no different if he had.
<P>
It is the Holy Spirit's job to illuminate the words of Scripture
and help you understand it. Yet Dr. Scofield wrote:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
And yet most [readers of the Bible], even of sincere believers,
soon retire from any serious effort to master the content of the
sacred writings. The reason is not far to seek. It is found in
the fact that no particular portion of Scripture is to be intelligently
comprehended apart from some conception of its place in the whole.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
How much more wrong he could have been, I don't know. The reason
people don't understand the Bible is because of two things: one,
they simply fail to read it and two, they fail to let the Holy
Spirit fill them - and of course, without the filling of the Spirit,
the reading of the Bible is probably the last thing a person would
want to do. If you do not have a hunger and thirst for the Word
of God, then all the study Bibles in the world won't help you.
Only God can fix that. And if you have a hunger and thirst for
the Word, the study Bibles will probably get in your way.
<P>
Christianity is by grace, not by the numbers. And reading the
Bible isn't by the numbers either. A study Bible can very easily
lock you into another man's opinion and quench the working of
the Spirit as you read and study.
<P>
Like commentaries of any sort, they should be resorted to only
after the individual has done study of the text on his or her
own. And the best study Bibles, like the best commentaries, do
not lock you into any one set doctrinal position, but rather give
you some sence of the variety that exists within Christianity
in those places where multiple interpretations are possible. Allow
the Holy Spirit to illuminate you while you read the Bible. The
Spirit is much more than just a doctrine.
