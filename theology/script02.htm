<B>C. Textual Criticism</B>
<P>
All this talk about the inerrancy of the Bible is good in abstract;
the reality is, however, that the current text of the Bible, as
we have it, <I>does</I> contain errors. However, there is a big
difference between assuming a perfect autograph into which subsequently
the sort of errors that copiests will make have crept in, and
assuming an autograph that was not perfect. Assuming perfection
at the beginning, the work of textual criticism is to restore
that original, pristine text.
<P>
1. Reason for it
<P>
The necessity for textual criticism is obvious, because the modern
reader is in the predicament of the man with two watches. If a
man has one watch, he knows what time it is. If he has two, he
is never sure. We have far more than two manuscripts - there are
literally hundreds - more specifically, there are about five thousand
manuscripts or portions of manuscripts of the NT or books of the
NT. However, things are not quite so hopeless as they are for
the man with two watches. There are methods - things that can
be done, to arrive at an accurate text.
<P>
2. Text families
<P>
As the various (5000) manuscripts have been studied, it has become
apparent that they may be categorized into what are called text
types or text families.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
a. Alexandrian
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
General characteristics: conciseness, no polished or embellished
inclusions; generally it has the shorter readings
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
General value: generally considered the oldest and best texts
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
b. Western
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
General characteristics: no tendency to paraphrase
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
General value: tends to support the other family types
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
c. Caesarean (Unclassified)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
General characteristics: tends to follow the Western pattern
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
General value: tends to support the other family types
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
d. Byzantine
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
General characteristics: tends to smooth out difficulties
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
General value: probably inferior; some believe that their abundance
should be taken into consideration. However this seems an odd
conclusion to draw, since majority cannot be said to imply right.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
3. Methods
<P>
The history of the biblical texts shows clearly that all of them
stand far removed from the originals both by time and by the process
of transmission. They contain not only scribal errors, but even
some actual transformations of the text, both deliberate and accidental.
By means of textual criticism we attempt to find all the alterations
that have occurred and then recover the earliest possible form
of the text.
<P>
Textual criticism proceeds in steps:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
a. All the variant readings of the text are collected and arranged.
Of course, this is the very reason textual criticism is necessary
at all. If we had only a single copy, there would be no questions,
but since we have several, which all say different things, we
have a problem. Which text accurately records the original statements?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
b. The variants must then be examined.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
c. The most likely reading is then determined.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
For the Old Testament, in order to carry out these steps, it is
necessary to use the Masoretic Text, which ordinarily serves as
the basis from which the textual critic will work. Combined with
the Masoretic Text the critic will consult all the ancient Hebrew
manuscripts and versions that might be available.
<P>
4. Ideally, the work of textual criticism should proceed with
all of these ancient versions and copies readily available. There
are then some basic rules that help place the textual criticism
of the Bible, whether Old or New Testament, on a firm basis that
generally avoids arbitrariness and subjectivity.
<P>
1. Internal Evidence
<P>
a. For the Old Testament, where the Hebrew manuscripts and the
ancient versions agree, we may assume that the original reading
has been preserved. Likewise, with the New Testament, where the
various manuscripts agree, we may assume the original text has
been preserved. To our great relief, this covers 95 per cent of
the Bible.
<P>
b. Where the manuscripts differ among themselves, one should chose
either the more difficult reading from the point of view of language
and subject matter or the reading that most readily makes the
development of the other readings intelligible.
<P>
In order to make this choice, it is necessary that the critic
have a thorough knowledge of the history and character of the
various manuscripts. It needs also to be realized that these criteria
work together and complement one another. A &quot;more difficult
reading&quot; does not mean a &quot;meaningless reading.&quot;
<P>
c. The shorter reading is preferred
<P>
The common tendency among scribes is toward additions and insertions
rather than omissions. Hence arose, in the first place, the marginal
glosses and insertions between lines which later transcribers
incorporated into the text. Although this rule has been widely
accepted, it must be applied with discrimination, a longer reading
being in some cases clearly more in harmony with the style of
the original, or the shorter having arisen from a case of homoeoteleuton.
d. the reading different from the parallel reading is preferred.
<P>
e. The reading that best explains the origin of other variants
is preferred. f. The reading that is most consistent with the
writer's style and vocabulary is preferred.
<P>
g. The reading that is in agreement with its immediate context
is preferred.
<P>
h. However, the critic must not assume that just because a reading
appears meaningless that it necessarily is. Scribes are not likely
to turn a meaningful passage into gibberish. Therefore, if a passage
is not understandable, that is often as far as we can go. We must,
as scholars, acknowledge our own ignorance.
<P>
i. With the Old Testament, where the Hebrew manuscripts and the
translations differ, and a superior reading cannot be demonstrated
on the basis of the above rules, then one should, as a matter
of first principle, allow the Hebrew text to stand. With the New
Testament, one will generally choose the shorter reading because
of the tendency of scribes to try to &quot;explain&quot; passages.
<P>
j. Where the different manuscripts differ and none of them seem
to make any sense, one may attempt a conjecture concerning the
true reading - a conjecture that must be validated by demonstrating
the process of the textual corruption that would have lead to
the existing text forms. Such a conjecture, however, must not
be used to validate the interpretation of a whole passage in that
it might have been made on the basis of an expectation derived
from the whole.
<P>
k. A reading is preferable which reflects no doctrinal bias, whether
orthodox on the one side or heretical on the other. This principle
is so obvious that it is accepted on all sides, but in practice
wide divergence arises, owing to the doctrinal bias of the critic
himself.
<P>
2. External evidence
<P>
1) Date - which ms. is earliest? The more ancient reading is usually
one that is supported by the most ancient manuscripts.
<P>
2) Text family - which family? Is it the more reliable text type?
<P>
3) Geographical distribution - is their a wide diffusion of the
variant? Great significance must be granted to the testimony of
witnesses from localities or times widely apart, and it can only
be satisfactorily met by balancing agreement of witness also from
different times and localities.
<P>
4) The reading that has the undoubted support of the earliest
manuscripts, versions, and patristic writers is unquestionably
original.
<P>
5) Mere numerical preponderance of witnesses to a reading of any
one class, locality, or time, is of comparative insignificance.
<P>
6) The disagreement of early authorities usually indicates the
existence of corruption prior to them all.
<P>
4. Important Manuscripts
<P>
a. Papyrus Fragments The Papyrus fragments are some of the earliest
NT texts available. They are written in uncial script, that is,
in all capital letters, without divisions between words or any
punctuation whatsoever. Most of the fragments date between the
second and fourth centuries AD.
<P>
b. Greek Manuscripts
<P>
1) Codex Sinaiticus
<P>
It was discovered by Tischendorf at St. Catherine's Monastery
on Mt. Sinai and now resides in the Imperial Library in St. Petersburg,
Russia. It dates from the 4th century. This is the only uncial
which contains the entire NT. It also has the Epistle of Barnabas
and part of the Shepherd of Hermas. The marks of many corrections
are found in the text. It is written on 147 and a half leaves
of very thin vellum in four narrow columns of 48 lines each. The
pages measure 15x13 and a half inches and the leaves are arranged
in quaternions of four sheets. The open sheet exposing eight columns
resembles greatly an open papyrus roll. There is but rudimentary
punctuation and no use of accent or initial letters.
<P>
2) Codes Alexandrinus
<P>
It received its names since it was supposed to have come from
Alexandria, Egypt, being the gift of Cyril Lucar, at one time
Patriarch of that Province, though later of Constantinople, to
Charles I, through the English ambassador at the Turkish court
in 1627, and in 1757 presented to the Royal Library and now in
the British Museum. It doubtless belongs to the 5th century, and
contained the entire NT, lacking now only portions of Matthew,
John, and 1 Corinthians, as well as containing the two epistles
of Clement of Rome and the Psalms of Solomon. It is written on
thin vellum in two columns of 41 lines to the page, which is 12
and five eighths by ten and three eighths inches. It employs frequent
initial capitals, and is divided into paragraphs, but has no marginal
signs except in the Gospels. Several different hands are discovered
in the present state of the manuscript.
<P>
3) Codex Vaticanus
<P>
Since 1481 it has been in the Vatican Library and it is universally
esteemed the oldest and best manuscript of the Greek NT. It dates
from the fourth century. Written on very fine vellum, the leaves
are nearly square, measuring 10 by 10 and a half inches, with
three narrow columns of 40-44 lines per column and five sheets
making the quire. A part of the Epistles to the Hebrews and the
Pastorals, Philemon and Revelation are missing. It is written
without accents, breathings or punctuation. In the Gospels the
divisions are of an earlier date than in Codex Sinaiticus. The
theory of Tischendorf that Codex Sinaiticus and Vaticanus were
in part prepared by the same hand and that they were both among
the fifty manuscripts made under the direction of Eusebius at
Caesarea in 331 for use in the emperor Constantine's new capital,
is not now generally accepted. 4) Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus
<P>
This is the great palimpsest (twice written) manuscript of the
uncial group, and originally contained the whole NT. Now, however,
a part - approximately half - of every book is missing and 2 Thess
and 2 John are entirely gone. It belongs to the 5th century and
is written on good vellum 9 by 12 and a half inches to the page
of 41 lines, and of one column in the original text, though the
superimposed writings of St. Ephraem are in two. Enlarged initials
and the Eusebian marginal sections are used and several hands
have corrected the Manuscript. Brought to Italy from the East
in the 16th century, it came to France with Catherine de'Medici
and is not in the Bibliotheque Nationale, Paris.
<P>
5) Codex Bezae
<P>
This is the early known manuscript which Theodore Beza obtained
in 1562 from the monastery of St. Irenaeus at Lyons and which
he gave in 1581 to the University of Cambridge, where it now is.
It is a Greek-Latin text, the Greek holding the chief place on
the left-hand page, measuring 8 by 10 inches and dating probably
from the end of the 5th century. Both Greek and Latin are written
in large uncials and are divided into short clauses, corresponding
line for line. The hands of no less than nine correctors have
been traced, and the critical questions arising from the character
of the readings are among the most interesting in the whole range
of biblical criticism and are still unsettled. It contains only
the Gospels and Acts, with a fragment of 3 John.
<P>
6) Codex Washingtoniensis
<P>
The U.S. has now in the National Library (Smithsonian) at the
capital one of the foremost uncial manuscripts of the Greek NT.
It is a complete codex of the Gospels, in a slightly sloping but
very ancient hand, written upon good vellum, in one column of
30 lines to the page, and 6x9 inches in size. It dates between
the 4th and 5th centuries.
<P>
c. Vernacular Versions
<P>
1) Latin
<P>
<B>Vulgate</B>. The Latin translation of the Old and New Testaments
that was made by Jerome about 400 A.D.
<P>
2) Greek
<P>
<B>The Septuagint</B> - a translation of the Old Testament into
Greek, made in Alexandria, Egypt about 250 B.C. There are several
versions, with minor variations among them. They are: the Codex
Sinaiticus, which dates to the fourth century A.D., the Codex
Alexandrinus, which dates to the fifth century A.D, and the Codex
Vaticanus, also of the fourth century A.D. 3) Syriac
<P>
<B>Peshitta</B>. The Syriac translation of the Old and New Testaments.
Syriac is an Aramaic dialect. The translation was done sometime
between 75 and 200 A.D.
<P>
4) Samaritan
<P>
<B>The Samaritan Pentateuch</B>. A copy of the first five books
of Moses kept by the Samaritans in Samaritan characters. It is
notorious for some deliberate alterations designed to legitimize
the Samaritan place of worship on Mt. Gerizim (cf. John 4:20).
<P>
5) Aramaic Targums
<P>
Less serviceable than the LXX for textual studies are the Aramaic
Targums (Targum is derived from the Aramaic word meaning translation)
both because they were standardized only later in their history
and because they contain aggadic (nonlegal or narrative) and paraphrastic
material, obviate anthropomorphisms, explain figurative language,
and modernize geographical names.
<P>
Origin:
<P>
During the Persian period the majority of the Jews began to use
Aramaic in addition to Hebrew; as a result, it became the custom
to interpret in the synagogue the reading of the Bible with Targums
after every verse. There are indications both in the rabbinic
literature and in the Targums themselves that they were committed
to writing at least by the first century AD.
<P>
1. Of the Pentateuch
<P>
a. Targum Onkelos
<P>
Because the Babylonian Talmud (Meg. 3a) attributes the official
Targum of the Pentateuch to Onkelos in a text obviously parallel
to a related account in the Jerusalem Talmud attributing the Greek
translation to Aquila (note the phonetic similarity of the two
names) A.E. Silverstone, along with many others, arrived at the
conclusion that Onkelos and Aquila are one and the same, but the
Babylonian applied to the official Aramaic version the tradition
in Palestine regarding Aquila's Greek translation. On the other
hand, we should note that on the basis of the mixture of Western
and Eastern Aramaic in Onkelos, some of the most competent Aramaists
believe it originated in Palestine, while its final redaction
took place in Babylonia. Then to, its halakhic (legal) and aggadic
(non-legal, narrative) content betrays the Palestinian school
of Aquiba of the second century AD. Possibly, then, Aquila had
a hand in its Palestinian base after which it was imported to
Babylonia where it was revised in the third century AD.
<P>
Like Aquila's Greek recension, the Hebrew text lying behind the
Aramaic is the one that ousted all rival recensions. While it
aims to conform the Targum as closely as possible to this base,
it misses the mark through the paraphrastic influences on all
Targums.
<P>
After the destruction of the cultural centers of Judea in the
first and second revolts against Rome, the centers of Jewish life
shifted to Galilee. Here Targums in the Galilean dialect evolved,
but it is widely agreed that they contain much earlier material.
The recently discovered Codex Neofiti I is the oldest complete
manuscript of this tradition and according to its editor, Diez
Macho, it belongs to the first or second century AD.
<P>
b. Targum Yerushalmi I
<P>
It has been mistakenly ascribed to Jonathan and therefore it is
sometimes known as Targum Jonathan (ben Uzziel) or Pseudo- Jonathan,
but more correctly called Targum Erez Israel by earlier Jews;
it lacks only fifteen verses of the pentateuch. It aggravates
the distinctive traits of the paraphrastic translation. Its early
base was revised not later than the seventh century.
<P>
c. Targum Yershalmi II
<P>
This targum is also called the Fragmentary Targum; it contains
about 850 verses, preserving fragmentary portions of the Pentateuch.
It is not clear how these fragments came together.
<P>
d. The Genizah Fragments
<P>
Edited by Kahle, they date from between the seventh and ninth
centuries AD and represent various recensions and contain both
older and younger materials.
<P>
2. Of the Prophets
<P>
a. Targum Jonathan
<P>
The history of this Targum is like Targum Onkelos: it originated
early in Palestine and was later revised in Babylonia at which
point it was recognized as being of ancient authority. According
to the Babylonian Talmud, it was written by Jonathan ben Uzziel
who is named as Hillel's most prominent pupil in the first century
BC. A conspicuous affinity between Targum Jonathan and Targum
Onkelos has led some to conclude that Targum Jonathan influenced
Onkelos. The usual rules of Targumic interpretation are observed,
but the renderings of the latter prophets are more paraphrastic
on the whole than in the former prophets.
<P>
b. Targum Yerushalmi to the Prophets
<P>
This work is known mainly from citations in Rashi and David Kimchi.
Codex Reuchlinianus, written in 1105 AD in the form of eighty
extracts, belongs to a later period, when the Babylonian Talmud
began to exert an influence on Palestinian literature.
<P>
3. Of the Hagiographa
<P>
In general, these contain older materials, but in the current
forms they did not originate until a later period. Written at
different times by different authors, they never enjoyed official
recognition.
<P>
6) Others
<P>
Other relatively early versions of the text are the Coptic, Gothic,
Armenian, Ethiopic, Georgian, Arabic, Nubian, Old High German,
Persian, Provencial, and Slavonic.
<P>
d. Patristic Quotations
<P>
The church fathers (early Christian writers antedating the time
of the apostles), not surprisingly quoted extensively from the
NT and OT; it would almost be possible to reconstruct the entire
NT from just the writings of the church fathers, alone. However,
the witness of the church fathers to the text is somewhat uneven,
since they were often times quoting from memory rather than verbatim,
with the text of the NT in front of them.
<P>
e. Hebrew Scriptures
<P>
For the Old Testament, the traditional text is what is known as
the Masoretic. The Masoretes were Jewish scholars who worked diligently
between the 6th and 10th centuries A.D. in Babylonia and Palestine
to reproduce, as far as possible, the original text of the Old
Testament. Their intention was not to interpret the Bible, but
to transmit to future generations what they regarded as the authentic
text. Therefore, to this end, they gathered manuscripts and whatever
oral traditions were available to them.
<P>
They were careful to draw attention to any peculiarities they
found in the spellings of words or the grammar of sentences in
the Old Testament, and since Hebrew in their day was a dying language,they introduced a series of vowel signs to insure the correct
pronunciation of the text, since traditionally, the text was written
with consonants only. Among the various systems developed to represent
the vowel sounds, the system developed in the city of Tiberias,
on the shore of the Sea of Galilee, gained the ascendancy. The
earliest complete copy of the Masoretic text of the Old Testament
is located in the St. Petersburg (formerly Leningrad) Public Library;
it was written about 1008 A.D. The Masoretic text is not a single,
unbroken thread, but rather a river of manuscripts, with both
a western and eastern branch; within the texts labeled &quot;Masoretic&quot;
there is a certain amount of variation and the Masoretes carefully
noted the differences in the texts that they used as their sources.
<P>
Therefore, it must be stressed that the so-called &quot;Textus
Receptus&quot; that one may hear of occasionally (especially from
those who believe that the King James Version is the only acceptable
translation) is mostly a pious fiction; it is a concept that has
little basis in reality beyond wishful thinking.
<P>
Remember, too, that English is not the only language that the
Bible has been translated into. It has been translated into over
two thousand languages by scholars using the original Greek and
Hebrew texts.
<P>
1) St. Petersburg Codex
<P>
The St. Petersburg (or Leningrad) Codex, 1008 A.D. It is the largest
and only complete manuscript of the entire Old Testament.
<P>
2) Qumran (Dead Sea Scrolls)
<P>
The earliest copies of Old Testament books are called the Dead
Sea Scrolls, a body of biblical manuscripts discovered since 1947
inside caves near a place called Qumran, right next to the Dead
Sea in Israel. The texts all date prior to 70 A.D., the period
when the community at Qumran was destroyed by the Romans following
the Jewish revolt. Some texts date as far back as 150- 200 B.C.,
based on epigraphic dating and Carbon 14 dating.
<P>
b. The Aleppo Codex, 930 A.D. It used to be a complete copy of
the Old Testament, but was partially destroyed in a synagogue
fire in 1948.
<P>
c. The British Museum Codex, 950 A.D. It is an incomplete copy
of the Pentateuch.
<P>
d. The Cairo Codex, 895 A.D. A copy of the Former and Latter Prophets
(Joshua, Judges, 1 and 2 Samuel, 1 and 2 Kings, Isaiah, Jeremiah,
Ezekiel, and the twelve minor prophets).
<P>
e. The St. Petersburg Codex of the Prophets, 916 A.D. containing
only the Latter Prophets.
<P>
f. The Reuchlin Codex of the Prophets, 1105 A.D.
<P>
g. Cairo Geniza fragments, 6th to 9th century, A.D.
<P>
5. The Causes of Textual Corruption The goal of textual criticism
is to remove the textual errors and restore the original readings.
To aid in this goal, it is helpful if the textual critic has an
idea of what sorts of errors he or she is likely to find.
<P>
When copying out a text, errors occur in every conceivable way,
as we no doubt know from our own experiences. Sometimes it is
difficult to explain, even to ourselves, how we might have come
to make a particular error. Therefore it is unlikely that we will
be able to correct or explain everything that has eluded the scribes
over the centuries. A reading that appears doubtful or corrupt
to us today may have been caused by a hole or some other damage
to the copyist's manuscript. Or maybe the letters or words in
a given section of his text were faded and nearly illegible, forcing
the copyist to make his best guess. Moreover, a single error can
give rise to many others, leaving us with no clue as to how it
might have happened.
<P>
And of course, as always, the assumption of a textual error may
really be only a cover for our failure to understand the language
or the idiom. Beyond these unrecoverable sorts of errors, there
are two categories of errors that may be distinguished and often
corrected: errors due to an unintentional, mechanical lapse on
the part of the copyist (often called Errors of Reading and Writing),
and two, errors that are the result of deliberate alteration (called
Intentional Alterations).
<P>
a. Errors of Reading and Writing
<P>
1. Confusion of similar letters
<P>
In Hebrew, there are several letters which look very similar to
one another: the B and K, R and D, H and T, W and Y.
<P>
2. Transposition of Letters
<P>
3. Haplography - a fancy word that means when there were two or
more identical or similar letters, groups of letters, or words
all in sequence, one of them gets omitted by error. Of course,
there is some evidence that some of these supposed &quot;errors&quot;
are actually equivalent to English contractions like &quot;don't&quot;
instead of &quot;do not&quot; and therefore are not errors at
all.
<P>
4. Dittography - another fancy word that refers to an error caused
by repeating a letter, group of letters , a word or a group of
words. The opposite, really, of Haplography.
<P>
5. Homoioteleuton - an even fancier word which refers to the error
that occurs when two words are identical, or similar in form,
or have similar endings and are close to each other. It is easy
in this sort of situation for the eye of the copyist to skip from
one word to the other, leaving out everything in between. A good
example of this occurs in 1 Samuel 14:41:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Therefore Saul said unto the Lord God of <B>Israel</B>, give a
perfect lot. (KJV)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Therefore Saul said, &quot;O Lord God of <B>Israel</B>, why hast
thou not answered thy servant this day? If this guilt is in me
or in Jonathan my son, O Lord, God of Israel, give Urim: but if
this guilt is in thy people <B>Israel</B>, give Thummim. (RSV)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The copyist's eye jumped from the first instance of the word &quot;Israel&quot;
to the last instance, leaving out everything in between for the
reading that the KJV translators had at their disposal. The word
translated &quot;perfect&quot; is spelled with the same consonants
in Hebrew (TH-M-M) as the word Thummim.
<P>
6. Errors of Joining and Dividing Words.
<P>
This is more a problem in the New Testament than it is in the
Old Testament, for while the Greek manuscripts were written well
into the Medieval period without spacing or dividing signs between
words, there is no evidence that this was EVER the case with the
Old Testament Hebrew texts. In fact, the evidence is very strong
to the contrary; inscriptions on walls from the time of Hezekiah
actually had dots between each word to separate them from each
other.
<P>
b. Deliberate Alterations
<P>
The Samaritan Pentateuch, as an example, is notorious for its
purposeful changes designed to help legitimize some of their sectarian
biases. They were sort of like the Jehovah's witnesses of their
day.
<P>
A more substantive change in the Hebrew text came after the Babylonian
captivity in the time of Ezra (fifth century BC) when the alphabet
changed from the Old Hebrew Script to the Aramaic Square Script
- in which all copies of the Old Testament except for the Samaritan
Pentateuch are written.
<P>
It should not surprise us that there have been a certain amount
of alteration in the text over time, since the Bible was not intended
to be the object of scholarly study but rather was to be read
by the whole believing community as God's word to them. Thus,
the text would undergo adaptations to fit the linguistic needs
of the community. For instance in Isaiah 39:1 the Masoretic Text
preserves a rare word, <I>hazaq</I>, which has the sense of &quot;to
get well, recuperate.&quot; The community that produced the Dead
Sea scrolls altered this word to the more common Hebrew word for
get well, <I>zayah</I>. Other examples of adaptation to colloquial
usage are likely. The lack of early material for the Old Testament
makes it impossible to demonstrate these sorts of alterations
on a larger scale. But a few small alterations are easily demonstrable.
<P>
The treatment of the divine name Baal is an example of deliberate
change for theological reasons. In personal names which included
the word &quot;Baal&quot;, which simply means &quot;master&quot;
or &quot;lord&quot;, the scribes deliberately replaced &quot;Baal&quot;
with &quot;Bosheth,&quot; which means &quot;shame&quot;. Hence,
Jonathan's son was actually named &quot;Meribbaal&quot; rather
than &quot;Mephibosheth&quot; (cf. 1 Chron. 8:34, 9:30 and 2 Sam
9:6, 19:24, 21:7) Another example of deliberate alteration is
found in Job 1:5, 11 and 2:5, 9 where we now read the word <I>berek</I>,
to bless (with God as the object) even though we should expect
to find the word <I>qalal</I>, to curse. The scribes replaced
the offensive expression &quot;to curse God&quot; with a euphemism
- motivated no doubt by their fear of taking God's name in vain.
<P>
C. The Nature of Translation
<P>
1. How translation occurs
<P>
It is important to realize - and most people who have not learned
a second language wouldn't know - that there is no such thing
as a one-to-one correspondence between languages. You cannot have
a word for word translation that is at all readable, because the
word order is different, the nature of the grammar is different
and even the sense of a word may cover a wider or smaller range
than the corresponding English word.
<P>
For instance, the word &quot;house&quot; in Hebrew can mean &quot;immediate
family&quot; or &quot;a royal dynasty&quot; besides the equivalent
English idea of a building where a person dwells. Therefore to
have an accurate English translation you cannot simply translate
the Hebrew word with &quot;house&quot;; you need to translate
it according to which of the possible meanings is intended.
<P>
Idioms, likewise, do not translate across directly: for instance
the English phrase &quot;I'm sick and tired of apple pie&quot;
if translated literally could give a reader in another language
the false impression that the individual in question is sleepy
and ready to throw up.
<P>
Consider the following &quot;literal translation&quot; of the
first verse of the Bible, which maintains the Hebrew word order
and phrasing and ask yourself if it is easily comprehensible:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>In-beginning he-created God (definite direct object) the-heavens
and-(definite direct object) the- earth. </B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
But even this is not entirely accurate in a word for word sense,
because Hebrew does not have past tense; however, there is no
other way to indicate perfect aspect (completed action). However,
when one of the prophets makes use of the perfect aspect to show
the certainty of the prophesy, to translate it as a past tense
can create the false impression that the prophet is speaking of
things that have already happened when that is not the case at
all! And in front of the single words (they are only one word
in Hebrew) &quot;the-heavens&quot; and &quot;the-earth&quot; is
the Hebrew word that indicates that what follows is a definite
direct object, as you can see, hardly translatable into English
at all.
<P>
Having said all this, one would imagine that this first verse
is a complicated sentence. Not at all. It is remarkably simple.
It only becomes difficult if we expect translation to be &quot;literal&quot;.
It isn't. All translation, by its very nature, is paraphrastic
and interpretive.
<P>
The way translation happens is as follows. The translator learns
a foreign language and learns it well. Learning Hebrew or Greek
is just like learning French or Spanish in high school. There
is nothing mysterious or special about the ancient languages.
Then the translator reads the foreign text and understands it.
Having understood it, he or she then puts it into the best English
possible.
<P>
There is no mystery associated with the translation of the Bible,
nor are there any significant disagreements between translations.
However, by the nature of what translation is - the work of individuals
with their own separate styles - the wording of say<I>, Today's
English Version</I> is not going to be identical to the <I>King
James Version</I> or the <I>New International Version</I>. Not
because anyone is trying to twist something or make it say what
it doesn't, but only because each translator is going to word
it as he thinks best. But the MEANING will be the same. And of
course between the King James and the more modern translations
there is also the gap caused by the change in the English language
- we don't speak like the people in Shakespeare's time did, but
their way of speaking is no &quot;grander&quot; or any more &quot;eloquent&quot;
than ours. King James English was the way any farmer or fisherman
of 1611 would have talked, just as <I>Today's English Version</I>
or the <I>New International Version</I> is the way an average
person speaks today. For all the snobbishness of attitude on the
part of some regarding Shakespeare today, in his own day he was
considered somewhat vulgar and not a little risque. Shakespeare
was like an ordinary television drama or sitcom is for us today.

D. Canon
<P>
(The material on Canon is excerpted from the book by James Barr,
<I>Holy Scripture: Canon, Authority, Criticism,</I> Philadelphia:
The Westminster Press, 1983 pp. 1-32)
<P>
1. What it is
<P>
There was not always a Bible. That is a truism, of course. And
all of you are quite aware that this is the case. When was the
time that was &quot;before scripture&quot;?
<P>
James Barr wrote:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Clearly, in the misty antiquity of the human race, before Abraham,
before the origins of Israel: then there was as yet no holy scripture.
But it is not to this distant antiquity that I refer. When we
say &quot;before scripture&quot;, we are speaking of the time
of the Bible itself. In what we call &quot;biblical times&quot;,
or in much of them, there was as yet no Bible.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Our traditional doctrine of scripture takes its departure from
the situation where the Bible is already complete, defined, known
and acknowledged. The Bible is understood to be already there,
it is already demarcated from other writings. This is so both
in Catholic and Protestant doctrines, but it is particularly evident
in Protestantism because in it the role and the authority of scripture
are more starkly isolated and more sharply defined as uniquely
essential.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Traditional doctrines - and most emphatically in Protestant orthodoxy
- are from the start predicated upon the existence of scripture
as a whole, as a collection delimited and defined. The canon of
scripture, that is, that list which defines which books lay within
it, and by exclusion, those which lay without it, is seen as complete,
exclusive, and unchanging; the attributes of scripture, its inspiration,
its necessity, its sufficiency, its clarity, and so on, are applied
in a level way to all parts of the Bible. In Protestant orthodoxy
scripture is taken to be the central criterion for faith, and,
even more, it is taken to be the central source for doctrine:
thus, doctrine is represented as derived from scripture, so that
in the total scheme of understanding, scripture is antecedent
to doctrine. Doctrine, to be valid, must derive from scripture.
Faith is required to be biblical. That's why the study of theology
always (except in one college to be left nameless) begins with
bibliology - the study of the Bible.
<P>
The Westminster Confession places its formulation of the doctrine
of scripture right at the beginning, before any other matters
at all are considered. Scripture was given by inspiration of God,
and the scope of its operation was defined with extreme precision:
all sixty-six books of the Protestant canon were completely inspired.
No other books were inspired at all. Everything else, however
good, belongs at the best to human tradition or ecclesiastical
opinion. Verbal inspiration means that all the words of the text
of exactly these books are inspired and therefore infallible.
All doctrinal formulation is to be strictly guided and controlled
by scripture and by no other comparable source of authority.
<P>
2. Problem
<P>
But there is a difficulty here which we must face: the question
of the canon itself. It is impossible to provide scriptural proof
for this most central of questions, namely, which precisely were
the books which had been divinely inspired. No passage in either
the Old or New Testament gives a list.
<P>
The list of contents prefaced to the Bible is not a part of the
inspired text of the Bible itself.
<P>
For evidence about what is within the canon, what exactly the
Bible is, one must go outside the canon itself. The most ancient
precise evidence for the shape of the Old Testament, which supports
the traditional Protestant view, is in Josephus (Ap. i.37-41).
He does not name the books precisely. He says there are five books
of Moses, thirteen books written by prophets to continue the history
after Moses, and four books containing &quot;hymns to God and
precepts for the conduct of human life.&quot; If one takes together
certain books, e.g. Judges and Ruth, Jeremiah and Lamentations,
this enumeration can fit that of the present Jewish and Protestant
canons.
<P>
Another source is 4 Ezra 14:37ff, which tells us that after the
Law had been burned and lost, and needed to be restored, five
men under the direction of Ezra wrote what had been dictated in
order, producing 94 books. Afterwards, the Most High spoke to
Ezra saying that the 24 should be made public so that all should
read them, but the other 70 should be kept and delivered only
to the wise. This is a text that is really interested in the numbering
and delimiting of the books, and at least some people, one supposes,
have thought it to be an inspired work: it is part of the Latin
Bible, even if only in an appendix nowadays. But of course it
is no more possible to use 4 Ezra than to use Josephus as proof
of a Protestant orthodox view of Scripture: 4 Ezra is a book considered
to be apocryphal, and - even worse - it expressly sanctioned the
authority of no less than seventy additional works outside the
Jewish canon.
<P>
These exotic sources being ruled out, there is, on the orthodox
view, no scriptural evidence to decide what are the exact limits
of the canon. Most books do not necessarily say whether they are
divinely inspired or not, and many books that do in some fashion
lay claim to divine inspiration were nevertheless not accepted
as canonical.
<P>
3. Tradition
<P>
Appeal can be made to the Fathers and to tradition but the Fathers
and tradition are disunited over exactly this matter. Protestantism
in following the Hebrew Canon, agrees with the judgment of Jerome.
<P>
And so, when all is said and done, what is the Bible? It is what
has been accepted traditionally; primarily, it is what the Jewish
tradition has been.
<P>
In the final analysis, we must accept the canon on faith - just
as we accept Jesus Christ on faith. The study of the Bible and
theology in a work such as this can become so technical, so esoteric,
so concerned with objectivity as regards facts, that we forget
to remember the element of faith, and the end or goal of our studies.
<P>
Consider Hebrews 11:1-6.
<P>
Please be reminded that we do not know and cannot know everything.
