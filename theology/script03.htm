<B>E. Necessity of the Bible</B>
<P>
1. General Revelation
<P>
General revelation refers to that revelation that comes from the
universe around and from history (see Psalm 19:1-6, Romans 1:19-20,
Psalm 8:13, Isaiah 40:12-14, 26, Acts 14:15-17, 17:24- 28) It
reveals such matters as the wisdom, power, and glory of God (Romans
1:20)
<P>
2. Special Revelation
<P>
Special revelation comes by means of miracles, direct communication,
the incarnation, and finally, through scripture. Scripture is
the principle way by which God currently reveals himself to human
beings, and it is the final judge and arbiter, the final authority
of all such communication, general or special.
<P>
3. Limitations of General Revelation
<P>
a. Ecclesiastes
<P>
The author of Ecclesiastes attempts to arrive at an understanding
of God and at an understanding of the purpose of human existence,
apart from God's self-disclosure in the Bible. He fails, arriving
at futility and despair: bad things happen to good people, good
things happen to bad people. There is nothing for us but to be
terrified at a capricious God and universe. 4. Limits of Special
Revelation
<P>
It is sufficient, not complete or exhaustive. It does not tell
us everything there is to know about God or the universe. General
revelation has its role to play, just as special revelation does.
<P>
F. Studying the Bible
<P>
When we think about studying God, the first place we usually look
is the Bible. What are some things we need to understand about
this book that we all own? We think we know all about the Bible,
don't we? It has been a part of western civilization for nearly
two thousand years, and most of us have been exposed to it all
our lives. We therefore assume we understand it.
<P>
But do we?
<P>
What Thorkild Jacobsen had to say about Sumerian religion should
give us pause as we consider the Bible:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Considering first the absolute distance in time from the end of
ancient Mesopotamian civilization shortly before the beginning
of our era to the present, it may be noted that it is not only
a distance but a clean break. No living cultural tradition connects
us with our subject, spans the gap between the ancients and us.
We are almost entirely dependent on such archaeological and inscrip-tional
data as have been recovered and upon our own contemporary attempts
at interpreting them. These data are, unfortunately, incomplete
and somewhat haphazard as sources for the total culture to which
they testify; and the languages of the inscriptional materials
are still far from being fully understood. The concepts denoted
by their words and the interrelations of these concepts, moreover,
are not infrequently incongruent with, or accented differently
from, anything in our present day culture and outlook, so that
misunderstanding and even failure to comprehend altogether are
constant stumbling blocks.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Formidable as our difficulties are, they are no cause for dismay
or for ceasing our efforts to understand. If they were, then earlier
generations should have been the ones to give up, for they had
far greater difficulties and far less help than we have. Actually,
the very realization that difficulties exist often goes a long
way toward overcoming them by forcing upon us the necessity of
other ways of thinking and evaluating than those to which we are
accustomed. We may become alert to the dangers of too easy generalization,
may doubt accepted translations and search for more adequate meanings
of a word.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
While the Bible is certainly familiar, it is also alien. It was
written thousands of years ago by people living thousands of miles
away from us, speaking a language unknown to most of us, and still
imperfectly understood by those who have devoted themselves to
its study. The culture of the Bible is radically different from
twentieth century America. A person diving into the Bible experiences
many of the same problems facing an American who travels to another
country. Alvin Toffler writes:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Culture shock is the effect that immersion in a strange culture
has on the unprepared visitor. Peace Corps volunteers suffer from
it in Borneo or Brazil. Marco Polo probably suffered from it in
Cathay. Culture shock is what happens when a traveler suddenly
finds himself in a place where yes may mean no, where a &quot;fixed
price&quot; is negotiable, where to be kept waiting in an outer
office is no cause for insult, where laughter may signify anger.
It is what happens when the familiar psychological cues that help
an individual to function in society are suddenly withdrawn and
replaced by new ones that are strange or incomprehensible.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The culture shock phenomenon accounts for much of the bewilderment,
frustration, and disorientation that plagues Americans in their
dealings with other societies. It causes a breakdown in communication,
a misreading of reality, an inability to cope.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
So it is with the Bible. It is an alien land, and many people
hop into it unprepared, expecting it to be populated with Americans.
They read American cultural values, composition techniques, and
democratic ideals into the ancient text. Those things that they
find in the Bible which don't fit twentieth century norms are
either ignored, misinterpreted, or explained away.
<P>
The people of the Bible, its authors and original readers, did
not think the same way as twentieth century Americans. The Old
Testament was not written by someone who lived his life in a suburb
of Columbus, Ohio. To take a modern example of the difficulties
we might face in understanding the Bible, think about the Australians.
The Australians speak English, they live in a modern industrialized
society, watch TV and do many of the same things Americans do.
&quot;Walzing Matilda&quot; is a song known to just about every
Australian, and Americans have heard the tune and may know a few
of the words:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>Once a jolly swag man camped by a billy-bong, </I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>Under the shade of a kulibar tree, </I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>And he sang as he sat and waited for his billy-boil, </I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>&quot;You'll come a-walzing, Matilda, with me.&quot; </I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
If Americans have difficulty understanding a simple song written
in their own language by people almost like themselves, is it
any wonder that we moderns should have difficulty fully understanding
the Bible? &quot;Walzing Matilda&quot; has nothing to do with
dancing or girls; instead, it refers to walking with a kind of
knapsack. A &quot;swag man&quot; is a hobo, and &quot;billy-bong&quot;
is a brook or pond. A &quot;kulibar&quot; tree is a eucalyptus
tree, and &quot;billy-boil&quot; is coffee.
<P>
Should we give way to despair then as we think about studying
the Bible? Is it a book that only specialists with years of study
can read? Not at all. But certain things do need to be kept in
mind as we begin reading it:
<P>
1. We must not assume that idioms or idiomatic ideas in the Bible
mean the same thing that they do in modern English. In other words,
don't make assumptions! Study things carefully. We must be careful
to notice how a word or phrase is actually being used in context,
before we assume that we understand what it signifies. We must
be constantly alert to unexpected meanings connected to what we
thought we already understood. For instance, in English, the word
&quot;heart&quot;, when it doesn't refer to the physical organ,
has the sense of the seat of the emotions. But in Hebrew and Near
Eastern society in general, it instead had the idea of &quot;mind&quot;,
or the seat of the intellect. A big difference!
<P>
2. Be careful to notice how the Biblical documents are structured;
notice that they don't follow the pattern we would expect of a
document written in English. For instance, in the Old Testament,
and even some in the New Testament, when the Jews wrote poetry
they did not rhyme the sounds; instead they rhymed the ideas.
In English, adjectives might be piled up one on the other, or
a carefully worded description of characteristics or appearance
might be given, but in Hebrew synonymous phrases are piled one
on top of another. For example, Psalm 1:1:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
or stand in the way of sinners
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
or sit in the seat of mockers...
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The author of Psalm 1 is not describing three different activities
or types of people. A native English speaker would have expressed
the verse differently:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>Blessed is the man who does not practice wickedness as a habit
of life. </I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Of course this bare prose statement is not as vivid or pretty
as the poetry of the Psalm, but this is the <I>meaning</I> of
Psalm 1:1.
<P>
Therefore, be open to new and different methods of expression.
Be careful not to prejudge a statement. Try to understand it in
its complete cultural context, as well as its textual context.
Check out how words and phrases are used in the Bible - not necessarily
how we use them in modern America.
<P>
3. We must approach the Bible as an exciting adventure in a foreign
country, where all is not as we may assume it to be. Most importantly,
we must realize this is where God reveals himself to us; to understand
Him, we must understand the place he reveals himself.
<P>
<B>B. What are Some Basic Guiding Principles for Bible Study?</B>

<P>
Certain presuppositions - hypotheses that are accepted at the
start of an argument as self-evident (like axioms in geometry)
- should be stated at the outset. They can be listed as a series
of eight points. The first three are basic presuppositions which
underlie modern science, and these same basic presuppositions
should also underlie anyone's approach to theology.
<P>
<I><B>1. There is an actually existing external universe.</B></I>

<P>
The universe, and everything it it, is real. That is should be
necessary to state explicitly something so obvious should not
be viewed as strange.
<P>
Certain eastern philosophies and religions would deny the validity
of just this point, leading inevidtably to solipsism. Thus, I
would assume that the Bible - God's special revelation - is real
in the same way that I assume the universe - God's general revelation
- is real.
<P>
<I>2. <B>The external universe is attainable accurately by our
senses. </B></I>
<P>
It is possible to gain an accurate understanding of the world
and everything in it by looking, hearing, feeling, and tasting.
In the same way, I would assume that we may gain an accurate account
of the Bible - God's special revelation.
<P>
<I><B>3. The external universe is orderly, endowed with cause
and effect and it follows the laws of logic. </B></I>
<P>
Likewise, the Bible - the special revelation of God - is orderly
and endowed with cause and effect and follows the laws of logic.
That is, we can gain a correct understanding of the Bible because
the Bible will be consistent, orderly, and sensible. A consistent
hermeneutic (interpretation or explanation) is possible in examining
the universe, and so a consistent hermeneutic is possible in examining
the Bible.
<P>
Irving M. Copi of the University of Hawaii and author of <I>Introduction
to Logic, </I>argues that there are three fundamental laws of
thought necessary and sufficient for thinking to be &quot;correct&quot;.
Traditionally, these are called:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
a.The Principle of Identity
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
b.The Principle of Noncontradiction
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
c.The Principle of the Excluded Middle
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<I>a. The Principle of Identity</I> 
<P>
Simply stated, the first of the fundamental laws is a tautology.
If any statement is true, then it is true. Some have criticized
this first principle on the basis that things change. For instance,
in 1790 one could make the statement: &quot;The United States
of America is made up of thirteen States.&quot; But obviously
such a statement is not true today. However, the fact of change
in human affairs does not negate this principle of logic. Statements
which change over time are said to be elliptical, or incomplete
statements. Thus, the statement &quot;The United States of America
is made up of thirteen States&quot; is a partial formulation of
the statement, &quot;The United States of America was made up
of thirteen states in 1790.&quot; Such a statement is as true
today as it was in 1790. Thus, as Copi said, &quot;When we confine
our attention to complete or non-elliptical formulations, the
Principle of Identity is perfectly true and unobjectionable.&quot;
<P>
<I>b. The Principle of Noncontradiction</I> 
<P>
Simply proposed, this asserts that &quot;No statement can be both
true and false.&quot; Or to take it a step further, &quot;A given
thing cannot be and not be in the same way and to the same extent
at the same time.&quot; This is a vital principle, without which
reasoned thinking is not possible. While it may seem obvious that
a given object cannot be both an apple and a peach, this principle
is often ignored or twisted out of shape by both secularists and
theologians.
<P>
The word &quot;paradox&quot; is used sometimes to describe contradictions
- contradictions that, some would say, must be accepted.
<P>
For instance, famous experiments with light indicate that under
certain experimental conditions, light acts as if it is made of
particles, while under other experimental conditions, light seems
to be made of waves. A contradiction! In some circles it has been
suggested that light is both and neither and we must live with
the contradiction.
<P>
Occam would shout &quot;Poppycock!&quot; to that conclusion. He
was a famous fourteenth century schoolman and philosopher, born
at Ockham in Surrey, England. A Franciscan, his fundamental principle
was that &quot;entities must not be unnecessarily multiplied.&quot;
That is, in arriving at a theory for any situation, the simplest
explanation that adequately handles all the data, is more likely
to be correct than a competing explanation which is more complicated.
One might call this the K.I.S.S. principle: keep it simple, stupid.
It more commonly is known as Occam's razor.
<P>
Therefore, in the question of the nature of light, the simpler
explanation, by making use of Occam's razor, is to say that the
experiments have settled nothing, and that further study is needed.
We can't just throw up our hands and say, &quot;Oh well, it's
both; let's say light is made of 'wavicles'.&quot; What the heck
is a 'wavicle'? The same thing arises in theology in attempts
to explain the Trinity, the relationship of free will to divine
sovereignty, or how a good, all powerful God could permit sin.
Too often, theologians are satisfied with the paradox - &quot;the
apparent contradiction&quot; - and leave it at that. Again, Occam's
razor would simply slice through the gobbledygook and tell the
theologians that they have more work to do. Frank Wilczek and
Betsy Devine, writing about nature (the general revelation of
God), made a very perceptive point, which has definite implications
for understanding the Bible (the special revelation of God):
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Nature poses many riddles but contains no contradictions. By solving
one of her puzzles, therefore, we are guaranteed to learn something
- and the weirder, the more impossible the paradox seems at first,
the more mind-expanding will be its ultimate resolution.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
What all this means then, is that contradictions cannot be real.
Such a conclusion is a very hopeful and useful tool, and has been
of immense impetus to scientific research, because this principle
of noncontradiction assures the researcher, in whatever field,
that there is, indeed, an answer to any conundrum. And if there
is an answer, then it is possible to find it.
<P>
On a personal level, this principle of noncontradiction has some
serious implications. Every day, we discover people who, within
their lives, are not living up to the principle. George Orwell
described the problem as &quot;doublethink&quot;. An older word
for this sort of person is simply &quot;hypocrite&quot;. The Bible
calls such a person a &quot;double-minded man&quot;:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If any of you lacks wisdom, he should ask God, who gives generously
to all without finding fault, and it will be given to him. But
when he asks, he must believe and not doubt, because he who doubts
is like a wave of the sea, blown and tossed by the wind. That
man should not think he will receive anything from the Lord; he
is a double-minded man, unstable in all he does. (James 1:5-8)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Come near to God and he will come near to you. Wash your hands,
you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded. (James
4:8)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Notice the sheer idiocy and irrationality of the hypocrisy: a
person goes to God to request something that He has promised to
give, but then doesn't believe God will give it. Such an attitude
irrationally contradicts the truthfulness and goodness of God,
not to mention explicit biblical statements that God does not
lie.
<P>
The second passage in James 4:8 goes even further, equating hypocrisy
with sin, or better yet, portrays the sinner as being a hypocrite
by definition. After all, a Christian claims to be filled with
the Holy Spirit, cleansed by the sacrifice of Christ, a new creature,
and yet he sins. Contradiction. Of all things a nonbeliever delights
in most, it is to point out the inconsistency of believers. I
give two examples:
<P>
Catholic theology teaches that the Pope and Church are infallible.
The doctrines and traditions handed down from the fathers are
as much the words of God as the Bible. Yet, thousands who claim
to be Catholic, feel perfectly justified ignoring the Catholic
Church's teaching on birth control, abortion, or women in the
Church. How can this be?
<P>
Doublethink; hypocrisy; inconsistency. To be a consistent Catholic,
to obey the concept of noncontradiction, the follower of Rome
must accept what the Catholic Church says in all things.
<P>
Otherwise, that one becomes by definition, no longer Catholic
- but Protestant.
<P>
By contrast, Baptists claim (in the Protestant tradition) that
the Bible alone is authoritative, that the individual Christian
is free to interpret the Bible for himself, and that all believers
are priests, equal before God. Yet in practice, the standard,
traditional interpretation of the Bible is the true authority,
and to dissent from that interpretation (particularly if you act
upon it) will often result in church discipline, censure, and
possible expulsion, as the pastor alone is really in charge of
things. Where then is biblical authority? Where then is soul liberty?
Where then is the priesthood of all believers? They are swallowed
in doublethink.
<P>
What is in our heads rarely matches our practice, and often contradicts
other ideas in our heads. Humans are strange that way. Listen
to George Orwell:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The Party said that Oceania had never been in alliance with Eurasia.
He, Winston Smith, knew that Oceania had been in alliance with
Eurasia as short a time as four years ago. But where did that
knowledge exist? Only in his own consciousness, which in any case
must soon be annihilated. And if all others accepted the lie which
the Party imposed - if all records told the same tale - then the
lie passed into history and became truth. &quot;Who controls the
past,&quot; ran the Party slogan, &quot;controls the future: who
controls the present controls the past.&quot; And yet the past,
though of its nature alterable, never had been altered. Whatever
was true now was true from everlasting to everlasting. It was
quite simple. All that was needed was an unending series of victories
over your own memory. &quot;Reality control,&quot; they called
it; in Newspeak, &quot;doublethink.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;Stand easy!&quot; barked the instructress, a little more
genially. Winston sank his arms to his sides and slowly refilled
his lungs with air. His mind slid away into the labyrinthine world
of doublethink. To know and not to know, to be conscious of complete
truthfulness while telling carefully constructed lies, to hold
simultaneously two opinions which canceled out, knowing them to
be contradictory and believing in both of them, to use logic against
logic, to repudiate morality while laying claim to it, to believe
that democracy was impossible and that the Party was the guardian
of democracy, to forget whatever it was necessary to forget, then
to draw it back into memory again at the moment when it was needed,
and then promptly to forget it again, and above all, to apply
the same process to the process itself - that was the ultimate
subtlety: consciously to induce unconsciousness, and then, once
again, to become unconscious of the act of hypnosis you had just
performed. Even to understand the word &quot;doublethink&quot;
involved the use of doublethink.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<I>c. The Principle of the Excluded Middle</I> 
<P>
The principle of the excluded middle asserts that &quot;any statement
is either true or false&quot;. Some have objected that if this
principle is accepted one is forced into a &quot;two-valued orientation&quot;
which implies that everything is &quot;either-or&quot;, with no
middle ground possible. Such an objection results from a misunderstanding
of the principle. If you have something that is gray, for instance,
the statements &quot;this is black&quot; or &quot;this is white&quot;
are both false. When faced with a situation where one is given
such statements, &quot;this is white&quot; or &quot;this is black&quot;,
while both statements cannot be true, they very easily might both
be false.
<P>
When one restricts oneself to statements that are unambiguous
and precise, then the principle of excluded middle is perfectly
valid. In other words, what this principle asserts is that <I>real</I>
contradiction is not possible, only <I>apparent</I> contradiction,
the result of limited language or data. By the principle of excluded
middle, when faced with the question of whether light is made
of waves or particles, since the experiments contradict each other,
it is best to assume that light is neither wave nor particle,
but something else: GRAY.
<P>
<I><B>4.The Bible is unique. </B></I>
<P>
The Bible should not be viewed as equivalent to a work of Shakespeare.
Shakespeare was brilliant, but his writings are a purely human
creation. The Bible, on the other hand, is not a purely human
creation: it is the very Word of God - God's special revelation
of himself to the human race.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Above all, you must understand that no prophecy of Scripture came
about by the prophet's own interpretation. For prophecy never
had its origin in the will of man, but men spoke from God as they
were carried along by the Holy Spirit. (2 Peter 1:20-21)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<I><B>5.Stand in humility before the text of scripture.</B></I>

<P>
When something in the Bible seems contradictory, or when something
does not appear to make sense, the reader should assume that he
or she is failing to understand something. One should question
his or her own reasoning abilities and knowledge, since our reason
and knowledge are in a finite, corrupted, and fallen state. Do
not question the reliability of the Bible.

<I><B>6. The reader must always ask &quot;Where is it written?&quot;</B></I>

<P>
Just because a good Christian says it or writes it, just because
the pastor says it, or just because &quot;that's what I've always
believed&quot;, does not necessarily make it true. What does the
Bible really say?
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Now the Bereans were of more noble character than the Thessalonians,

<I><B>7. Do not be afraid of the Bible.</B></I> 
<P>
The ultimate source of authority for Christians is the Bible,
not our theological preconceptions, not our cultural preferences
or fears. If what the Bible says does not square with one of our
theological ideas, then we must change our theological idea! We
must not go through strange contortions to get the text to support
our preferred viewpoint.

So the Pharisees and teachers of the law asked Jesus, &quot;Why

He replied &quot;Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you

And he said to them: &quot;You have a fine way of setting aside

Moses said, 'Honor your father and mother,' and 'Anyone who curses
his father or mother must be put to death.' But you say that if
a man says to his father or mother: 'Whatever help you might otherwise
have received from me is &quot;Corban&quot; (that is, a gift devoted
to God), then you no longer let him do anything for his father
or mother. Thus you nullify the word of God by your tradition
that you have handed down. And you do many things like that.&quot;

<B>C. What is the Value of Tradition?</B> 
<P>
What is tradition, and what value does it have? These are two
questions that need to be asked now, as we think about how to
approach the text of scripture. We all come to the Bible with
preconceived notions about the proper interpretation of given
passages. How much weight should be allowed for that which &quot;has
always been taught&quot;?
<P>
<I><B>1. Definition of Tradition:</B></I> 
<P>
The dictionary defines &quot;tradition&quot; as &quot;the handing
down of information, beliefs, and customs by word of mouth or
by example from one generation to another without written instruction.&quot;
It can also be defined as &quot;an inherited pattern of thought
or action (as religious practice or social custom)&quot; or it
involves &quot;cultural continuity in social attitudes and institutions.&quot;
Tradition has been described as opinion which has the force of
habit behind it. That is, the difference between opinion and tradition
is that an opinion belongs to an individual, while tradition belongs
to a group.
<P>
<I><B>2. The Value of Tradition: </B></I>
<P>
James Barr has some interesting thoughts on tradition in his book,
<I>Holy Scripture: Canon, Authority, Criticism: </I>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
In spite of what has been said about the positive importance of
tradition, and the way in which scripture emerged from tradition,
we do not suggest that Protestantism was wrong in claiming scripture
as its authority and in denying that tradition (after scripture)
could be placed on the same level as scripture or that tradition
should be allowed to decide what was the right exegesis of scripture.
In all this Protestantism was in many ways right. But Protestantism
is not proof against the vices which it itself set out to reform.
It is perfectly possible today to reiterate the positions of the
older Protestant orthodoxy, to regard its judgments as virtually
final and to resist the possibility that they might be substantially
modified as a result of more modern research into scripture. What
then happens is that the traditional &quot;Catholic&quot; and
&quot;Protestant&quot; roles come to be reversed: the facts of
scripture are once again obscured through the imposition of a
tradition, but this time it is not a medieval Catholic tradition,
it is a Protestant tradition, built upon the insights of the seventeenth
century and anxious to maintain these insights against the evidence
of the text of scripture or at least against the fact that quite
different interpretations of the text are possible. When one looks
at the various &quot;conservative&quot;, &quot;orthodox&quot;,
or &quot;evan-gelical&quot; schemes of doctrine which are so influential
today, and all of which energetically proclaim the authority of
scripture as their first principle, it requires no great insight
to see that in many cases it is &quot;conservatism&quot; or &quot;Calvinism&quot;,
or &quot;evangelicalism&quot; that is the actual authority, which
is the real dominant power. The Bible is fully authoritative,
but it does not have authority to question the accepted doctrinal
tradition. This is analogous to the late medieval position against
which the Reformers protested.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Biblical authority on Protestant terms (on Catholic or Orthodox
terms it may be otherwise) exists only where one is free, on the
ground of scripture, to question, to adjust, and if necessary
to abandon the prevailing doctrinal traditions. Where this freedom
does not exist, however much the Bible is celebrated, its authority
is in fact submitted to the power of doctrine and interpretation....If
the Bible says a certain thing, but says it only when understood
through an existentialist interpretation, or through a Calvinist
interpretation, then it becomes very doubtful whether the Protestant
appeal to scripture can be maintained at all....

<P>
What does the Bible have to say about the value of tradition?
Without exception it is viewed as a corrupting influence.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
See to it that no one takes you captive through hollow and deceptive
philosophy, which depends on human tradition and the basic principles
of this world rather than on Christ. (Colossians 2:8)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
For you have heard of my previous way of life in Judaism, how
intensely I persecuted the church of God and tried to destroy
it. I was advancing in Judaism beyond many Jews of my own age
and was extremely zealous for the traditions of my fathers. (Galatians
1:13-14)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Notice also Mark 7:1-13, and the parallel passage, Matthew 15:1-9.
It is a great challenge to find anything positive about tradition
in the Bible: there simply isn't anything. It must be noticed
that Christ's condemnation of traditions involved the interpretations
of the Bible which had become traditional. When asked to explain
the why of an interpretation, the worst imaginable answers are
&quot;That is what I was told&quot;, or &quot;That is what the
Church has always believed.&quot;
<P>
In a Sunday School lesson regarding a passage in Isaiah several
students disagreed with the teacher's interpretation of the text.
Unfortunately, the arguments brought against the teacher's interpretation
were based not on the Bible, but on tradition.
<P>
One student expressed the fear that if we were to question all
the traditions, we would then have nothing to believe in. Another
wondered whether a small Sunday School class shouldn't be hesitant
to postulate something different from the generally accepted view.
&quot;Who are we to go against tradition?&quot;
<P>
I was reminded of the criticisms voiced against Martin Luther
and his radical insistence on &quot;Only Scripture&quot; and &quot;salvation
by faith&quot;, that such beliefs were contrary to the established
traditions of the church. Several students reacted by saying,
&quot;Well, that's different. Luther was right and those traditions
of the Catholic Church were obviously wrong.&quot; Ah, how easy
to see the speck in the eye of another!
<P>
Attacking tradition results in the same criticism faced by Copernicus
as he demonstrated that the Sun was the center of the Solar System,
and not the Earth. It is the same criticism faced by Martin Luther
King, Jr. as he tried to get a nation to accept Blacks as human
beings, deserving of equal respect and treatment.
<P>
Tradition dies hard, and it complains a lot.
<P>
D.A. Carson, in his book <I>Exegetical Fallacies,</I> writes:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Careful handling of the Bible will enable us to &quot;hear&quot;
it a little better. It is all too easy to read the traditional
interpretations and invest them with a false, even idolatrous,
degree of certainty. Because traditions are reshaped as they are
passed on, after a while we may drift far from God's Word while
still insisting all our theological opinions are &quot;biblical&quot;
and therefore true. If when we are in such a state we study the
Bible uncritically, more than likely it will simply reinforce
our errors. If the Bible is to accomplish its work of continual
reformation - reformation in our lives and our doctrine - we must
do all we can to listen to it afresh, and utilize the best resources
at our disposal.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
To appeal to tradition, to argue that because such and such an
idea has always been accepted, is to fall prey to the logical
fallacy of simplistic appeals to authority. Again D.A. Carson:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Such appeals can be to distinguished scholars, revered pastors,
cherished authors, the majority, or various others. The fallacy
lies in thinking that appeals to authority constitute reasons
for interpreting texts a certain way; but in fact, unless that
authority's reasons are given, the only thing that such appeals
establish is that the writer is under the influence of the relevant
authority! The most such an appeal can contribute to an argument
is to lend the authority's general reputation to its support;
but that is not so much a reasoned defense or explanation as a
kind of academic character reference.

<B>D. Theological Method</B> 
<P>
At the outset of Bible study, three questions need to be asked,
and they need to be kept firmly distinguished from each other.
Confusing these three questions has resulted in many errors:
<P>
<I><B>1. What does the Bible really say?</B></I> 
<P>
First off, we must determine what the text is actually reporting.
What, precisely, is written on the page? The second question is
related, but it is the second step, and must be kept separate
from this first question.
<P>
<I><B>2. What does the Bible mean?</B></I> 
<P>
Too often people skip the first question and dive headfirst into
the second, not realizing the difference. It's no wonder they
get into trouble. Only after we have clearly articulated what
the Bible says, can we go on and ask about the meaning - the interpretation
- of a given passage.
<P>
<I><B>3. How does the Bible apply to me?</B></I> 
<P>
Finally, and only after the first two steps have been taken, can
the final, third step be made to personal application, where the
text takes on relevance to an individual in a particular place
and time. A common fallacy in modern Christianity, and a source
of considerable confusion, derives from the tendency to skip the
first two steps, leap on the third, and then trumpet the application
as the eternal and universal truth, ignoring fully the actual
context and meaning of the text - and sometimes even denying that
it matters.
<P>
Of course, the contrary mistake can be made, of ignoring this
third step altogether, resulting in Bible reading that is as dead
and useless as perusing the yellow pages for entertainment.
<P>
Let's look at how these steps can be put to use with a silly example.
We are presented with the following text: &quot;This dog is white.&quot;
That is all it says, no more, no less. Any step beyond this bare
statement, any questions we ask about it, begin the process of
interpretation. Does the text mean that all dogs are white? Does
the text tell us that this dog is all white, without a spot of
other color on him? How white is white? What kind of dog is it?
Are there any types of dogs we can exclude because of this statement?
Does this statement about a white dog mean the dog is an albino?
Where is the dog from? Is it a live dog or a dead dog? Such questions
are endless, and at this point, random. To help organize our search
for meaning, we may categorize the sorts of questions that must
be asked:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
1. What is the definition/connotation of the words?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
2. Are these words universal or specific in their application?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
3. What is the context?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
4. The newspaper questions: Who, What, When, Where, Why and How?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Practically speaking, in thinking about the Bible, we can say
without hesitation that the Bible is the absolute, inerrant word
of God, and that anything it says is absolutely correct. The Bible
describes reality for us: not simply A reality, but <I>the</I>
reality.
<P>
But, and this is vital: <B>WE MUST BE CAREFUL NOT TO CONFUSE OUR
INTERPRETATION OF THE BIBLE WITH THE ACTUAL STATEMENTS OF THE
BIBLE.</B> The distinction must be kept clearly in mind. Our interpretation
may accurately reflect the true meaning of the Bible. Our interpretation
may indeed be what the Bible &quot;says&quot;. But again, our
interpretation may<I> not </I>be what the Bible &quot;says.&quot;
<P>
We must work at knowing what the Bible says. We must explicitly
label - at least in our own minds - that which is stated, and
that which is left unsaid.
<P>
So how does this three step approach work with an actual passage
of scripture? Let's look at Genesis 3:21:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Yahweh God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife and clothed
them.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
What does Genesis 3:21 say? It says that God made clothes for
Adam and Eve. No more and no less is indicated by the words of
this sentence.
<P>
But what is the popular interpretation of these words in Genesis?
That here is a sacrifice by God for the sin of Adam and Eve. To
make skins, an animal had to be killed; therefore its blood was
shed, and thereby atonement was made for their sins. This was
the example God made, so that Adam and Eve would know how to sacrifice.
<P>
Question: is this what the text actually <I>says</I>?
<P>
Of course not.
<P>
The popular interpretation <I>may</I> be valid; however, there
is no textual support for it. No other passage in the Bible refers
to this incident or gives it the popular interpretation of &quot;sacrifice&quot;.
It would be best to take Genesis 3:21 at face value and leave
it at that; it is more consistent with the grammatico-historical
method of interpretation. The popular interpretation is subjective,
and appears to represent a more allegorical approach to biblical
interpretation.
<P>
Uh-oh, I just used a big hyphenated word in the last paragraph:
&quot;grammatico-historical&quot; interpretation. What in the
world does that mean? Walter E. Kaiser, Jr. wrote:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The grand object of grammatical and historical interpretation
is to ascertain...the specific usage of words as employed by an
individual writer and/or as prevalent in a particular age. And
the most fundamental principle in grammatico-historical exposition
is that words and sentences can have only one signification in
one and the same connection.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
In studying the Bible, the attempt is made to figure out the explicit
meaning of a given text, to understand it fully in its historical
and cultural context, and to fully understand the idiom of the
author. This is sometimes called the &quot;literal&quot; approach;
this does not mean a failure to recognize idioms, though. For
instance, if a given passage says &quot;the king was sitting on
his right hand&quot;, unless the text gives us a particular reason
to think so, the clear meaning of the text is that the king was
sitting to the right of the other individual; it is very unlikely
to mean that the king had his butt on the other guy's palm - or
his own palm. That would be an abnormal understanding of the language.
Still, all possibilities, however bizarre, should be explored
as hypotheses in attempting to arrive at the true meaning of a
given passage.
<P>
One other thing should be noted: what we derive from the text
of scripture alone may not be enough to properly understand what
is going on. In the <I>Baptist Bulletin,</I> the official organ
of the General Association of Regular Baptist Churches, an article
was published in April 1986, in which Gerardus D. Bouw argued
that Copernicus was wrong. Instead, Bouw insisted that the sun,
and everything else, goes around the Earth, which is stationary
at the center of the universe. He bases his contention on such
statements as Joshua 10:12-14 which states:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The sun stopped in the middle of the sky and delayed going down
about a full day.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Bouw argues that there are hundreds - even thousands - of verses
which support his contention that the sun goes around the Earth
and not the other way around. We have all been hoodwinked. The
Bible speaks about the &quot;sun setting&quot; and the &quot;sun
rising&quot;, and he insists that such statements must be accepted
literally. To speak of phenomenological language is to miss the
point, he argues.
<P>
From a strictly literal perspective, Bouw is right about what
the Bible states. But what does the Bible <I>mean</I>?
<P>
This author has forgotten that there are two revelations from
God: the special revelation we call the Bible, and the general
revelation of the universe around us. The Bible is absolutely
correct in everything it states, but the problem remains that
we don't always correctly <I>understand</I> it. Until the time
of Copernicus, many people had misinterpreted both the words of
the Bible, and the phenomena of nature. Recognizing that the sun
is indeed the center of the solar system does not mean that we
are forcing the Bible to say something it doesn't; it simply means
that we gain the proper understanding of what it intended. To
say that the sun goes around the Earth is as silly as insisting
that two and two are five. It is not a matter open to question.
There are no doubts at all about a heliocentric system. It is
not a theory or a hypothesis. It is reality.
<P>
<B>E. What Are Some Standards for Responsible Interpretation?</B>

<P>
1. The meaning of a biblical statement is going to be the ordinary,
normal meaning of the words: a meaning in keeping with the context,
idiom, and purpose of the given author. Therefore, it is important
for us to remember that listing a reference &quot;does not necessarily
mean that one's interpretation of it is faithful to the biblical
meaning.&quot; Cults are commonly guilty of messing up at this
point. Let's be careful not to be like them.
<P>
2. The meaning of the biblical statements should fit the historical
and cultural setting of the writer and readers. That's why archaeology
and the study of history are valuable. The frame of reference
can't be ignored. We must be very careful not to interpret the
Bible through our own culture.
<P>
3. The meaning of a sentence is the one that best fits the writer's
context. The usage an author makes of a word is what is important.
The definition of a word is contextually determined. The etymology
is of hardly any importance in truly gaining an understanding
of a word. The sentence is the basic unit of a writer's thought.
&quot;Then the sentence should be understood in relation to the
other books in its Testament. And the two Testaments need to be
related to each other.&quot;
<P>
4. The Bible doesn't contradict itself.
<P>
5. The intended meaning of the text is going to be the literal
historical-grammatical one. There is not a &quot;deeper&quot;
or &quot;secret&quot; meaning. Avoid allegorization and spiritualization
of the Bible. Such techniques come from the Middle Ages, and are
the province of such modern groups as Theosophy, Christian Science,
and the New Age Movement. There is no place for such things in
a truly rational approach to Scripture.
<P>
6. Scriptural passages are comprehensible as they are related
to, and informed by others. For instance in 1 Corinthians 15:10
Paul writes:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace to me was
not without effect. No, I worked harder than all of them - yet
not I, but the grace of God that was with me.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
A passage like this informs our understanding of passages that
refer to the &quot;works&quot; that Christians do. Rather than
imagining that &quot;works&quot; passages contradict the gospel,
a passage like this clarifies the intent. Salvation by grace has
inevitable outward manifestations. Any work we do, the effort
we make, is actually God working through us. God does the work,
not us.
<P>
Thus, Paul's intention in Ephesians 5:1-15 is clear:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Be imitators of God, therefore, as dearly loved children and live
alife of love, just as Christ loved us and gave himself up for
us as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
But among you there must not be even a hint of sexual immorality,
or of any kind of impurity, or of greed, because these are improper
for God's holy people. Nor should there be obscenity, foolish
talk or course joking, which are out of place, but rather thanksgiving.
For of this you can be sure: No immoral, impure or greedy person
- such a man is an idolater - has any inheritance in the kingdom
of Christ and of God. Let no one deceive you with empty words,
for because of such things God's wrath comes on those who are
disobedient. Therefore do not be partners with them.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord.
Live as children of light (for the fruit of the light consists
in all goodness, righteousness and truth) and find out what pleases
the Lord. Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness,
but rather expose them. For it is shameful even to mention what
the disobedient do in secret. But everything exposed by the light
becomes visible, for it is light that makes everything visible.
This is why it is said:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;Wake up, O sleeper,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
rise from the dead,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
and Christ will shine on you.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Be very careful, then, how you live
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
- not as unwise but as wise.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
It is impossible for a person to take a passage like Ephesians
5:1-15 and try to make that inform our understanding or comprehension
of Ephesians 2:8-10, because to do so creates a contradiction.
Likewise, our understanding of the book of James is informed by
our comprehension of Ephesians 2:8-10, Galatians 3:1-6, and the
rest. Ephesians and Galatians inform our understanding of Peter's
comment on Lot in 2 Peter 2:7-8, or how Jephthah as described
in Judges 11:24-40, who sacrificed his daughter as a burnt offering,
can still wind up listed with David and Samuel in Hebrews 11:32.
<P>
Which of a given possible interpretations is correct can be demonstrated
by determining which passages inform other passages. How? Through
recognizing the proper cause and effect. For instance, wringing
a nose produces blood (Proverbs 30:33). However, blood does not
produce the wringing of a nose.
<P>
Thus, grace produces good works, but good works do not produce
grace. Besides the logical problem of imagining otherwise, Paul
is explicit:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
And if by grace, then it is no longer by works; if it were, grace
would no longer be grace. (Romans 11:6)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I do not set aside the grace of God, for if righteousness could
be gained through the law, Christ died for nothing! (Galatians
2:21)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
You who are trying to be justified by law have been alienated
from Christ; you have fallen from grace. (Galatians 5:4)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Certainly there are occasions when informing will work both ways;
however, in the case of grace versus works, the concept expressed
by &quot;salvation by grace through faith&quot; informs the concept
&quot;good works;&quot; the reverse, in this case, simply is not
possible, both by logic and by the text of Scripture.
<P>
Therefore, questions such as &quot;is baptism necessary&quot;
are like the question Paul dealt with in his letter to the Galatians:
&quot;is cirumcision necessary?&quot; Since salvation is not a
matter of outward action, the answer must be no. Outward action
is a <I>consequence</I> of grace.
