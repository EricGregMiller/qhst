<B>The Transcendence of God</B> 
<P>
Under the title of the transcendence of God may be included the
following items, ordinarily handled separately by traditional
systematic theologies: immutability, eternity, omnipresence, omniscience,
omnipotence, and sovereignty. In his book, <I>God and the New
Physics</I>, Paul Davies has pointed out that:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
A growing number of people believe that recent advances in fundamental
science are more likely to reveal the deeper meaning of existence
than appeal to traditional religion. In any case, religion cannot
afford to ignore these advances.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
In a course I taught on the book of Genesis I asked the question:
&quot;What are the theological implications of modern physics?&quot;
It is a question that none of my students were able to answer
fully, even after two lectures discussing the matter. Yet, it
is a question that begs of an answer, because the place where
modern physics has the most light to shed on theology is in this
area of the transcendence of God. Traditional systematic theology
is very good at describing the &quot;what&quot; of God. Where
it lacks most is in the &quot;how&quot;. That is precisely where
modern physics will be useful, as we will soon see.
<P>
<B>God is Immutable</B> 
<P>
So, who is God, or perhaps, more accurately, what is God? God
is immutable. This means that God does not change. The Bible indicates
that he is the same yesterday, today, and forever. The classic
verses demonstrating this point are Psalm 102:24-27 and Malachi
3:6. Bancroft, commenting on this attribute, writes:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Reason teaches us that no change is possible in God, whether of
increase or decrease, progress or deterioration, contraction or
development. All change must be to better or worse. But God is
absolute perfection, and no change to better is possible. Change
to worse would be equally inconsistent with perfection
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
This immutability must not be confused with immobility. God does
act and move and react. He will promise to destroy a wicked person,
but then will relent when that person repents. God has not changed,
he is simply behaving consistently with his personality.
<P>
A sailing ship, moving against the wind, must tack back and forth,
making progress only very slowly, while at the same time a second
ship going the other direction makes easy, rapid progress along
a straight line. It is not that the wind is behaving differently
in the two instances; rather, the position of the ships is different.
Likewise, as humans alter their perception and place before God,
they may think God has moved or changed. The reality is actually
that the person himself has moved or changed. As we will see with
God's love, the same actions may be perceived very differently
depending on the vantage point of the observer.
<P>
But of course, we must ask the question: is Bancrofts assumption
and definition, that change must be from worse to better or better
to worse, accurate? Does change, by definition, indicate some
lack of perfection? If I change from the suit I wore at work into
jeans and T-shirt so I can mow the lawn, have I changed from better
to worse? Or worse to better? No, just that one sort of clothes
are for one situation, and another for a different.
<P>
Is Bancroft's definition, and his concept of immutability consistent
with the incarnation, or the change that occured in Jesus as he
grew from infancy to adulthood?
<P>
If we actually examine the passages used in support of the traditional
concept of immutability, we will discover that they merely describe
God's consistency -- that is, that he is always loving, always
just, always opposed to sin, and the like.
<P>
<B>The Eternality of God</B> 
<P>
Genesis 21:33, Deuteronomy 32:40, Psalm 90:2, and Psalm 102:27
are the classic texts on the eternality of God (see also, Hebrews
1:10-12, Revelation 13:8, and 2 Peter 3:8). By this, I mean that
God is without beginning or end; he is free from the succession
of time. God is not in time: instead, he sees the past, present,
and future equally clearly. He sees Adam eating the forbidden
fruit, the birth of Christ, the explosion of the Challenger, and
the last judgment all at once.
<P>
An interesting question to consider, both for the eternality of
God, as well as for our everlasting state: why doesn't God get
bored?
<P>
One could suggest that the indeterminancy of the universe (free-will)
has something to do with it.
<P>
<B>God is Omnipresent, Omniscient, and Omnipotent </B>
<P>
It is very difficult to separate these three attributes of God,
though traditional systematic theologies always try. The three
are closely interconnected. A good passage for giving a complete
picture of God's power in general - of his knowledge, strength
and presence - is Isaiah 40:18-28:
<BLOCKQUOTE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
What image will you compare him to?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

and its people are like grasshoppers.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
and spreads them out like a tent to live in.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
and reduces the rulers of the world to nothing.

and a whirlwind sweeps them away like chaff.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
and calls them each by name.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
A picture of God's interaction with the world: the higher and
lower brain functions. Our brains automatically keep our hearts
pumping and lungs filling and hormones flowing and food digesting.
How much conscious thought goes into keeping the stars burning
or the wind blowing? God is intimately and immanently involved
with everything in the universe; but some of that may be on the
order of our lower brain functions.
<P>
<B>Omnipresence</B> 
<P>
When &quot;omnipresence&quot; is mentioned, traditionally the
thought has been that God, &quot;in the totality of His essence,
without diffusion or expansion, multiplication or division, penetrates
and fills the universe in all its parts.&quot; [Bancroft, p. 78].
<P>
This is, perhaps, overstating it a bit. The relevant Old Testament
passages are Genesis 16:13, 1 Kings 8:27, Isaiah 66:1, Jeremiah
23:23-24, Psalm 139:7-10, Amos 9:2-3, and the book of Jonah. Perhaps
a better way of describing God's omnipresence, one more in keeping
with the biblical materials, is to say simply that &quot;there
is no place one can go to get away from God.&quot; Bancroft's
definition creates unnecessary complications and potential contradictions:
for instance, how can the Incarnation - or any theophany - or
the indwelling work of the Holy Spirit - be reconciled with Bancroft's
quotation? Consider the difficulties it would face with the behavior
described in Genesis 3:8, 4:16, and 18:20- 21.
<P>
How does omnipresence work? If one were immortal and able to travel
freely in time, one could devote a hundred percent attention on
every detail of every individual's life that ever lived or would
ever live and not even break a sweat.
<P>
One could learn everything: the future self, having been and searched
everywhere, would be all knowing, and yet, at any given point,
would be learning that information for the first time. Perhaps
it explains what we see in Genesis 18, when God says he's going
to see if things are as bad in Sodom and Gomorrah as he's been
told. We just happen see him going to learn the information for
the first time, from our perspective, though from the persepective
of eternity, it is considerably different.
<P>
Rev. 13:8 indicates that Jesus has been crucified since the creation
of the world, yet from our perspective, the crucifiction happened
on one spring afternoon in the fourth decade of the common era.
<P>
Omniscience becomes more explicable in this -- God, free to travel
in time, knows all because he went and looked at everything. And
he's a detail person: we're told he knows how many hairs are on
each of our heads.
<P>
<I>Quantum mechanics: Heisenberg uncertainty principle.</I> 
<P>
We can know that given a block of uranium 238 , that in 4.5 billion
years (4,500,000,000) half of it will decay to thorium 234 and
finally to lead 206. However, we cannot ever say if a given atom
will decay in that time.
<P>
<I>Encyclopedia Britannica</I> (vol. 5, p. 502, 1984):
<P>
It is impossible to predict the instant when any given radioactive
atom will disintegrate. But, when enough radioactive atoms are
placed together, observation shows that the number of disintegrations
per unit time is proportional to the number of radioactive atoms
present. The situation is analogous to the death rate among the
human poplulation insured by an insurance company. Although it
is impossible to prdict when a given policy holder will die, the
company can count on paying off a certain fraction of beneficiaries
every month.
<P>
Statistical certainty is sitting on top of individual indeterminism.
But though God might not be able to predict the outcome for each
individual atom, he could check and find out and watch to see
which ones change and which ones don't, and then make any corrections
or adjustments that he saw fit in order to preclude or cause a
certain outcome: for instance, a man chancing past the block gets
struck by an irradiated electron, which causes damage to certain
DNA strands in a particular sperm cell with which he will impregnate
his wife, resulting in an offspring with certain mutations (good
or bad).
<P>
Depending on what God wanted, knowing that a given atom would
decay would be useful, and he could manipulate the situation to
either prevent or cause the mutation.
<P>
Yet, the God at the end of time, also free to move anywhere, already
knows, sees and has done everything. Yet the how of that achievement
was by moving in endless loops through his creation. Omnipresence
is preserved and explained -- that is we can see, at least to
some extent, the how of it -- the mechanism. And it explains the
confusing and troubling passages where we see God asking for information,
or traveling to check something out. It may even explain the places
where God &quot;repents&quot;, or seemingly changes his mind.
<P>
Does this sort of eternal looping have anything to say about how
we comprehend the Trinity? One can picture a single deity, thanks
to time loops, in more than one place at the same moment of time,
and even interacting with the various versions of himself. Yet,
quite obviously, there is still only one God.
<P>
<B>Omniscience</B> 
<P>
Omniscience, generally and classically, is defined as God's perfect
knowledge of all things. In other words, there is nothing that
God does not know. The standard Old Testament texts would be Job
28:20-28, Psalm 139:2-4, 17-18, and Jeremiah 17:10. Potential
problems that arise in reconciling Genesis 18:21, 22:12, Deuteronomy
8:2, and Deuteronomy 13:3 are easily explained by noting that
in all instances God is explaining things for the benefit of his
human audience. The heuristic purpose of his questions should
not be ignored: God asks the questions for the purpose of eliciting
certain responses from his human audience, not because he is unaware
of the answers.
<P>
<B>Omnipotence </B>
<P>
Finally, God is said to be omnipotent and sovereign. A few relevant
passages may be listed: Genesis 1:1, Genesis 50:20, Jeremiah 24:5,
32:27, Psalm 139:13-16, Isaiah 46:8-13 and Job 2:10. The problems
of God's sovereignty verses human free will, sin, and responsibility
have already been thoroughly discussed in the section on ethics.
<P>
<B>God and Time</B> 
<P>
What are the theological implications of modern physics? Augustine
(AD 354 - 430), in speaking of the creation of the universe wrote:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The world and time had both one beginning. The world was made,
not in time, but simultaneously with time.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
His words of more than a thousand years past, express well the
basic thrust of relativistic physics. Augustine ridiculed the
idea of picturing God waiting an infinite time and then deciding
at some propitious moment to create a universe - because without
the universe, time doesn't exist. God is outside time, unbound
by it. Psalm 90:4 records:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
For a thousand years in your sight
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
are like a day that has just gone by,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
or like a watch in the night.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Notice also 2 Peter 3:8. Paul Davies, in<I> God and the New Physics</I>
discusses the implications of the theory of relativity for time.
He writes that the revolution in our ideas of time can be summarized
by stating that, whereas time was once viewed as &quot;absolute,
fixed, and universal - independent of material bodies or observers...&quot;
it is now recognized as being dynamic: it can &quot;stretch and
shrink, warp and even stop altogether at a singularity.&quot;
Today, the movement of clocks are recognized as not absolute;
instead, such movements are relative to the state of motion or
the gravitational situation of the observer. This has forced physicists
to abandon some long held assumptions. For example, there is no
longer a universal agreement on the choice of &quot;now&quot;.
<P>
An experiment has been proposed. If one were to get a set of twins
and then place one in a spaceship moving at very close to the
speed of light, and then leave the other on Earth, an interesting
phenomenon would occur. If the destination of the twin in the
spaceship were a star twenty light years away, upon his return,
he would have aged at most a few months. His twin on Earth, however,
would be many years older. This is known as the time dilation
effect, and has been described fictionally in <I>Time For the
Stars</I> by Robert A. Heinlein and <I>The Forever War</I>, by
Joe Haldeman - among others. To give a sense of the weirdness
this effect entails, let me quote a short passage from <I>The
Forever War:</I> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
We wound up spending a lot of time in the tanks, just to keep
from looking at the same faces all day long in the crowded ship.
The added periods of acceleration got us back to Stargate in ten
months, subjective. Of course, it was 340 years (minus seven months)
to the hypothetical objective observer.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Time dilation is not a fictional concept. Arthur C. Clarke writing
in <I>The Promise of Space</I> discussed what would happen to
a spaceship approaching the speed of light:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
When the ship had reached 87 per cent of the speed of light (580
million mph), everything inside it would seem to be taking twice
as long as it should from the point of view of the outside observer;
two hours of ship time would be only one hour of Earth time. At
98 per cent of the speed of light the time rate would be slowed
fivefold, at 99.5 per cent tenfold, at 99.99 percent a hundredfold.
Thus the effect increases very rapidly as one nears the velocity
of light; but once again it must be emphasized that to the crew
of the ship, not only does everything appear normal - everything
IS normal. They are not responsible for the peculiar behavior
of the rest of the universe; their clocks and tape measures are
just as good as anybody else's.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Only when they had slowed down, turned around, and come home again
would they discover any discrepancy, and then they would be confronted
with the most famous paradox of the Theory of Relativity. For
centuries might have passed on Earth, while they had aged only
a few years aboard their speeding ship....
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
As a final example of the time-dilation effect, which also gives
some idea of the energy requirements, it would be rather difficult
to surpass a calculation made some years ago by the late Dr. Eugene
Sanger. He considered a spaceship circumnavigating the cosmos
- assuming that this represents a distance of ten billion light-years.
If the ship could achieve 99.999,999,999,999,999,996 per cent
of the velocity of light, the crew would imagine that the journey
had lasted thirty-three years - yet ten billion years would have
elapsed before they returned to Earth (if it still existed and
they could find it). Since this feat would require the complete
conversion into energy of a mass approaching that of the Moon,
Sanger decided that this far surpassed the limits of the technically
feasible. Of course, he may be right. But because now we know
that there are energy sources in the universe which appear to
be turning Moon-sized masses into radiation every ten seconds,it
might be best to reserve judgment even on this point.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
While such a concept as time dilation may seem like something
that can't possibly be real, it has been demonstrated empirically
in an experiment involving aircraft circling the Earth. More convincing
yet, time dilation slows down the decay rates of unstable muons
(traveling at near light speed), permitting them to reach sea
level following their creation in the upper atmosphere.
<P>
Quantitative tests of time dilation have been performed numerous
times at particle accelerators. A classic experiment was performed
in 1966 at the accelerator at the European high-energy laboratory
in Geneva, called CERN. Muons produced by collisions at one of
the targets in the accelerator were deflected by magnets so that
they would move on circular paths, and so could be stored for
a decent interval (such &quot;storage rings&quot; have become
an integral part of most high-energy accelerators). Their speeds
were 99.7 percent of the velocity of light, and the observed twelve-fold
increase in their lifetimes agreed with the prediction with 2
percent accuracy. Modern-day atomic clocks keep time so accurately
that in order to compare time kept on Earth at such installations
as the U.S. Naval Observatory or the Bureau International de l'Heure
in Paris with time kept on atomic clocks in orbiting satellites,
the time dilation must be accounted for, or discrepancies will
arise between the various observatories.
<P>
Davies points out that the demonstration of the Theory of Relativity
has some rather serious implications:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
One inevitable victim of the fact that there is no universal present
moment is the tidy division of time into past, present, and future.
These terms may have meaning in one's immediate locality, but
they can't apply everywhere.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
This abandoning of a distinct past, present, and future is a profound
step; as people, we are tempted to assume that only the present
really exists. It is, as Davies says,
<BLOCKQUOTE>
...usually presumed, withouth thinking, that the future is as
yet unformed and perhaps undetermined; the past has gone, remembered
but relinquished. Past and future, one wishes to believe, do not
exist. We like to believe that only one instant of reality occurs
at a time. The Theory of Relativity makes nonsense of such notions.
Past, present, and future must be equally real, for one person's
past is another's present and another's future.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Davies writes:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The physicist's attitude to time is strongly conditioned by his
experiences with the effects of relativity and can appear quite
alien to the layman, although the physicist himself rarely thinks
twice about it. He does not regard time as a sequence of events
which HAPPEN. Instead all of past and future are simply THERE,
and time extends in either direction from any given moment in
much the same way as space stretches away from any particular
place. In fact, the comparison is more than an analogy, for space
and time become inextricably interwoven in the theory of relativity,
united into what physicists call SPACETIME.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
When God created the three dimensions of which we are accustomed,
he also created the fourth dimension. Our universe is not three
dimensional, but four (or perhaps more. One theory suggests there
may be ten). When God created the universe, it was ALL created.
To separate time from God's creation is as impossible as separating
his attributes from him or from one another.
<P>
We don't even have time to discuss some of the wilder possibilities
presented by quantum mechanics, what effect those theories have
on such questions as causation, free-will verses determinism,
and the possibility of an infinite number of alternate universes.
As someone once said, the universe is not only stranger than we
imagine, it is stranger than we <I>can</I> imagine.
<P>
Humility in the face of God is only reasonable.
<P>
<B>Love</B> 
<P>
God is love, the Bible tells us (1 John 4:7-8). The story is told
about the theologian Karl Barth, that when asked about what was
the most profound thought he'd ever had, responded: &quot;Jesus
loves me, this I know, for the Bible tells me so.&quot;
<P>
I will argue that the theme, the grand unified field theoryof
the Bible is love (Consider Matthew 22:36-40, Romans 13:8-10 and
Galatians 5:14).
<P>
<I>I. Introduction to Love</I> 
<P>
Love is a universal human emotion. Some would go so far as to
say it is one of the things that distinguishes us from the animals.
Unfortunately, such a thought is utterly divorced from reality,
because recent studies indicate that animals, too, experience
love. The differences between humans and animals becomes ever
less as we learn more about them. Some studies even show that
they not only have emotions such as love and fear, they also seem
to think, to plot, to cheat, and even to lie to one another.
<P>
<I>A. Koko</I> 
<P>
Koko is a 230 pound female gorilla who converses in American Sign
Language (Amerslan). Her vocabulary includes 500 signs that she
uses on a regular basis and an additional 500 which she recognizes.
For more than twelve years, she has been the focus of study by
the Gorilla Foundation of California. On occasion the study has
received support from the National Geographic Society.
<P>
One day, Koko told her trainer, Dr. Francine &quot;Penny&quot;
Patterson, that she wanted a cat. So Dr. Patterson gave her a
toy cat. Koko was not satisfied. In June 1984 a litter of three
kittens was taken to the rural compound near San Francisco that
Koko calls home. The kittens had been abandoned at birth and were
wet-nursed by a dog for four and a half weeks. Koko signed &quot;Love
that&quot; to the kittens, and after carefully examining them
all chose a tailless male and named him &quot;All Ball&quot;-though
she generally refers to him now as simply &quot;Ball&quot;. <I>National
Geographic</I>, in January 1985 reported that:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
For Koko's July birthday, Penny drew a cat - as requested - on
her cake. &quot;What did I draw?&quot; she asked. &quot;Ball,&quot;
replied Koko. &quot;Koko love visit Ball.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The article in <I>National Geographic</I> went on to report:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Koko sniffs the kitten, treating him much as she would a baby
gorilla. She carries Ball tucked into her thigh and attempts to
have him nurse. Like a child with a pet, she dresses Ball in linen
napkins and hats. And she signs to Ball that they should tickle
each other - one of her favorite games.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Perhaps one of the most intriguing things is Koko's reaction to
the kitten when it bites her. Sometimes she laughs, but usually
she simply signs &quot;obnoxious&quot;. Dr. Patterson says that:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;It's encouraging that Ball can hurt Koko and Koko won't
hurt him. She seems to like his feisty nature.&quot; Or, as Koko
has said of Ball: &quot;Soft good cat cat.&quot;

<I>B. Adulterous Baboon</I> 
<P>
Jake Page, writing in the <I>Los Angeles Times</I> reported the
following:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Deliberate deceit has been found nowhere in the animal kingdom
so much as among primates. In one flagrant case, a female hamadryad
baboon engaged in a clandestine affair with a younger male. Typically
in such troops, a dominant male sees to it that the harem remains
faithful to him.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
In this instance, the illicit pair hid from the old boy behind
a rock. After each coupling, the female would look up innocently
over the rock and, in one instance, went over to the leader and
presented herself to him, reassuring him that all was well before
heading back for more trysting behind the rock.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The differences between the animals and us are not so great. We
share a huge array of physiological, biochemical, and behavioral
similarities. Carolyn Ristau of New York's Rockefeller University
said:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
We and most existent animal life have nervous systems that are
remarkably similar, and most neurons are connected by synapses
that also seem quite similar. If we wish to assume other species
are not conscious, what is it that is so distinctly different
about our nervous system that precludes consciousness in other
species?

Love is a wondrous state, deep, tender, and reassuring. Because
of its intimate and personal nature it is regarded by some as
an improper topic for experimental research. But, whatever our
personal feelings may be, our assigned mission as psychologists
is to analyze all facets of human and animal behavior into their
component variables. So far as love or affection is concerned,
psychologists have failed in their mission. The little we know
about love does not transcend simple observation and the little
we write about it has been written better by poets and novelists.

<P>
Advances in the study of love have been made since Harlow's address
in 1958. Harlow himself investigated mother-infant attachments
in monkeys, which he labeled as &quot;love&quot;. He assumed,
though, that there is a big difference between the love found
in monkeys, and the love found in adult human beings. However,
I don't know that this difference has actually been demonstrated;
it remains simply a tacit assumption.
<P>
In the context of Stanley Schachter's labeling theory of emotion,
love could be seen as simply a label humans have learned to place
on their own physiological arousal. However, as can easily be
demonstrated, love does not always - or perhaps even usually -
involve intense physical symptoms. Instead, love can be understood
as a particular sort of attitude that one person has toward another.
<P>
In 1970, on the basis of studies he made at the University of
Michigan, Zick Rubin developed an attitude measure that he called
a love scale; according to Rubin, this scale consists of three
components:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
a. attachment
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
b. caring
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
c. intimacy
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
In the textbook, <I>The Psychology of Being Human</I>, Zick Rubin
writes:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>Attachment</I> refers to a person's need for the physical presence
and emotional support of the other person. It corresponds to the
sort of love studied by Harlow in infant monkeys and to the emotional
attachment discussed by Weiss.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>Caring </I>refers to a person's feelings of concern and responsibility
for another person. Caring corresponds to Erich Fromm's (1956)
definition of love as &quot;the active concern for the life and
growth of that which we love.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>Intimacy</I> refers to a person's desire for close and confidential
communication with another person. When we love someone, we want
to share certain of our thoughts and feelings with that person
more fully than with anyone else.

<P>
<I>D. Questions </I>
<P>
At this point, certain questions should have arisen in the reader's
mind. What is love? Is love simply a biological reaction, tied
completely to glandular excretions? Or is love a rational, unselfish
action? Or is it a combination of mental and biological elements?
And then, if love is operative even in animals, what is the difference
between humans and animals? What in the world does it mean when
Christians and Jews say that human beings are created in the image
of God?
<P>
<I>II. What is the Image of God?</I> 
<P>
It is unfortunate that too often Christians study neither the
Bible nor the world around them when they attempt to answer the
question of what it means that human beings were created in God's
image.
<P>
Genesis 1:26-27 records the bare statement that Adam and Eve were
made in His likeness:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Then God said, &quot;Let us make man in our image, in our likeness,
and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the
air, over the livestock, over all the Earth, and over all the
creatures that move along the ground.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created
him; male and female he created them.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
What does all that mean? The significance of humans existing in
the image of God is that they therefore are very valuable and
important. In Genesis 9, following the flood, God stresses the
image of God as the fundamental difference between humans and
animals. Animals were for food - but not people.
<P>
Perhaps the significance of the image of God is all that we need
to understand. However, Christians have long wondered exactly
what God might have meant when he said we were created in &quot;His
image&quot;. The traditional answer given by most Christians runs
as follows:
<P>
1. Men and women possess attributes of personality
<BLOCKQUOTE>
a. Reason
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
b. Creativity
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
c. Love
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
d. Morality
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
e. Freedom
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
f. Responsibility
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
g. The ability to commune with God
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The above list is all well and good, but it raises two valid questions.
The first, is how does this list significantly differentiate us
from the animals? Certainly there is a difference of degree between
humans and animals, but the Bible strongly suggests that there
is a significant difference of KIND, which the above list doesn't
clarify. The second question that needs answering is likewise
devastating: where in the Bible is the &quot;image of God&quot;
defined as it is in the list above?
<P>
To summarize the objections, we might say that both natural revelation
and special revelation invalidate the traditional view.
<P>
Is there an answer then?
<P>
Certainly, and it is surprisingly simple. Look at Genesis 5:1-3:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This is the written account of Adam's descendants: When God created
man, he made him in the likeness of God. He created them male
and female; at the time they were created, he blessed them and
called them &quot;man&quot;.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
When Adam had lived 130 years, he had a son in his own likeness,
in his own image; and he named him Seth.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
If the reader searches a concordance, he or she will find that
every occurrence of the Hebrew words &quot;image&quot; and &quot;likeness&quot;
refer to a physical resemblance. In fact, &quot;image&quot; is
often used to describe an idol. It is most logical, therefore,
to conclude that the image of God in human beings is exactly what
a natural understanding of the words imply: human beings were
made to look like God. Moses contrasted what was normal in his
society with a different reality: where in the ancient Near East
it was universally the case that people made images of gods, God
now taught that instead, He made people as images of himself.
<P>
The objection that orthodox tradition might raise at this point
is tied to its failure to recognize what &quot;spirit&quot; means.
God, the Bible says over and over, is a spirit and invisible;
he is decidedly not physical. However, from these biblical statements,
an unwarranted assumption is made: non-physical means formless.
<P>
Where does the idea of a formless God come from? Certainly not
from the Bible, which speaks commonly of the hand, arm, eye and
so on of God. Instead, the concept of a formless God is Greek
in its origins. The words of Empedocles are illustrative:
<P>
We cannot bring God near so as to reach him with our eyes and
lay hold of him with our hands...For he has not human head attached
to bodily members, nor do two branching arms dangle from his shoulders;
he has neither feet nor knees nor any hairy parts. No; he is only
mind, sacred and ineffable mind, flashing through the whole universe
with swift thoughts.
<P>
What Empedocles wrote dominated the thinking of later Greek philosophers
like Plato, whose understanding then entered Christian thought
in the Middle Ages; such thinking has dominated Christian theology
ever since. Unfortunately, such a perspective does not match the
Bible. It is clear that human beings are of a different substance
than God: God is a spirit, while human beings are physical. However,
this does not mean that God is formless. Angels, for instance
are spirits, but they indeed have a form, usually rather strange
by human standards (cf. Ezekiel 1:4-14 for a description of Cherubim).
<P>
It is generally assumed by commentators that references in the
text of scripture to the finger, hand, eye, arm, face, or back
of God are &quot;anthropomorphisms&quot; - that is, descriptions
of God in human terms for the sake of human understanding: the
indescribable is described. However, there are no scriptural warrants
for understanding the descriptions of God in anything other than
an ordinary way. The idea of anthropomorphism as an explanation
seems to occur first in the writings of Aristobulus, a Jew of
the second century BC. Aristobulus, and later Jews made use of
the allegorical method of interpretation, finding it a convenient
means of explaining away those features of the Old Testament which
were troublesome in some way. Thus Aristobulus saw deeper meaning
in the anthropomorphic expressions. He announced, for example,
that those texts which described God standing, symbolized the
steadfastness of the Earth created by God. The desire in Judaism
to explain away the anthropomorphic expressions in the Old Testament
becomes particularly apparent in the Targums - Aramaic translations
of the Old Testament - where any mention of any human characteristic
connected to God is carefully eliminated.
<P>
Part of the responsibility for the belief that the descriptions
of God with feet, hands, face, and so on are not to be accepted
literally, rests with Thomas Aquinas. He taught that it was impossible
to describe the heavenly reality in anything but symbolic language.
He argued in his <I>Methods of Hermeneutics</I>, that the Bible
has a symbolic meaning, because heavenly things cannot be explained
in earthly terms without some degree of symbolism.
<P>
Yet, the Old Testament unequivocally states that God has a form.
<P>
Numbers 12:8 records:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
With him I speak face to face, clearly, and not in riddles; he
sees the form of Yahweh...
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Or Psalm 17:15:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
And I - in righteousness I will see your face;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
When I awake, I will be satisfied with seeing your form.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The Hebrew word for &quot;form&quot;, in case you wonder, as used
in these two passages, means exactly what the English word &quot;form&quot;
means (see its use in the following passages: Deut. 4:12, 16,
23, 25; 5:8; and Job 4:16, for example). Consider also Exodus
24:9-11:
<P>
Moses and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and the seventy elders of Israel
went up and saw the God of Israel. Under his feet was something
like a pavement made of sapphire, clear as the sky itself. But
God did not raise his hand against these leaders of the Israelites;
they saw God, and they ate and drank.
<P>
There is no reason to make such a puzzle out of &quot;the image
of God&quot; in man. As many of the early church fathers wrote,
it must include the physical and bodily characteristics - not
just the immaterial.
<P>
One final note. Only human beings are explicitly said to be created
in the image of God. Therefore, those places which speak of animal-like
qualities for God, i.e. &quot;his wings&quot; (Psalm 17:8; 91:4;
and Ruth 2:12) should be recognized as the metaphors that they
are.
<P>
On the other hand, we must take into consideration the fact of
other &quot;pictures&quot; of God in the Bible -- as for instance
in Genesis 15, where he shows up as a smoking fire pot, or in
the books of Moses, where he appears as a pillar of fire at night,
and a pillar of cloud by day -- or in Exodus, where he appears
to Moses as a flaming bush.
<P>
One must ask the question, whether appearances are symbollic in
the same sense language -- words -- are symbols of the underlying
reality, but are not that reality themselves. The black lines
on the page spelling out &quot;water&quot; do not quench my thirst
or wash my body; they merely symbolize the sound which symbolizes
the substance that I could fill my swimming pool with.
<P>
So, when we see God appearing, is his appearance part of the symbolism
that allows clear communication in other respects, such as his
choice of language and vocabulary, and general adjustment to the
cultural background of those he contacted? God, after all, wished
to be perfectly clear to those to whom he talked. So, when we
see God appearing as a biped in Genesis 18, is that appearance
the one that corresponds to ultimate reality, or is it his appearance
in Genesis 15 as a smoking fire pot?
<P>
If we argue that physical appearance is what constitutes the image
of God, then what of human beings who are deformed, whether by
birth or through some tragic accident? Do such people then lack
the <I>imago dei</I>?
<P>
On the other hand, if the more traditional formulation of &quot;image
of God&quot; is accurate, then what of the retarded, the autistic,
the insane, or even the foetus? Is their lack of -- or severely
damaged -- reason, volition, emotions and the like indicative
of their no longer having -- or perhaps never having -- the image
of God in them? The eugenic Nazi would thus argue, and we must
be careful in our definition that we don't give him that amunition.
<P>
If the thought of excluding some human beings from the image,
whether for physical or sentient reasons is distasteful and repugnant,
what will we do with non-human sentience, whether extraterrestrial
or electronically based?
<P>
Obviously, this question is far more complex than it may at first
appear.
<P>
<I>III. Definitions of Love</I> 
<P>
Again, I'd like to focus on the Old Testament. In the last chapter,
I gave evidence that its theme is love - the love of God for people
(particularly Israel), and the love required of people (especially
Israel) for God and for each other. It is therefore important
that the reader of the Old Testament have a proper understanding
of this concept called love. <BR>
In popular usage, &quot;love&quot; is a word filled with emotion;
it is a very positive, warm fuzzies sort of feeling. And there
is this aspect to its use in the Bible. However, that warm sort
of love is only one side of what is contained in the biblical
concept of love. In the Old Testament, love is two-sided (sort
of like the Force in Star Wars). There is:
<P>
1) The affirming side of love.
<P>
2) The inhibiting side of love.
<P>
Everyone knows, or rather <I>thinks</I> he or she knows, what
the affirming side of love is all about, though even with that,
most really have no clear concept at all. And the inhibiting side
of love? Most know it under a different name: wrath. How this
works out will become clear as we move along.
<P>
The main words used in Hebrew to express the idea of love in the
Old Testament are <I>ahab, raham,</I> and <I>hesed</I>. It is
the word <I>hesed</I> that most clearly displays the two halves
- affirmative and inhibitive - of love. <I>Ahab</I> and <I>raham</I>
are most often used for only the affirmative aspects of love.
These three words need to be examined in some detail.
<P>
<I><B>Ahab</B></I> 
<P>
<I>1. Introduction</I> 
<P>
The Hebrew root <I>ahab</I> and its derivatives are found not
only in the Old Testament and Hebrew texts of later times, but
also in some related Semitic dialects - although it doesn't occur
very often outside of Hebrew. For instance, in the Aramaic papyri
from Elephantine, <I>ahab</I> appears only as part of a proper
name.
<P>
In the Old Testament it occurs in all genres and in all time periods.
That the Old Testament frequently uses the root, while related
languages use it but rarely, indicates the use of <I>ahab</I>
in Biblical Hebrew developed independently from these other languages,
perhaps because of the significant theological differences between
Hebrew culture and the other cultures of the Ancient Near East.
<P>
In 1748 Schultens made the suggestion that the Hebrew <I>ahab</I>
was related to the Arabic word <I>habba</I>, which means &quot;to
breathe passionately, to be stimulated.&quot; Proverbs 30:15,
Psalm 55:22, and Hosea 8:13 are sometimes quoted to lend support
to Schultens' suggestion; however, it is very questionable that
&quot;breathing passionately&quot; is an appropriate translation
in any of the three passages mentioned.
<P>
Frankly, the etymology of the word <I>ahab</I> cannot be determined
with any degree of accuracy.
<P>
<I>2. Usage</I> In any case, it is not the etymology which determines
the meaning of a word, but rather its actual usage. The emotional
feeling expressed by the word <I>ahab</I> is often contrasted
with the word <I>sana</I>, &quot;hate&quot; (see Deuteronomy 5:9,
10; 21:15; Judges 14:16; 2 Samuel 19:6; Isaiah 61:8; Amos 5:15;
Micah 3:2; Malachi 1:2; Psalm 45:7; 109:5; Proverbs 9:8; 10:12;
12:1; 13:24; 14:20; 15:17). In Proverbs 15:9 it is contrasted
with <I>toebah</I>, &quot;to detest&quot;. Psalm 109:4 denounces
the ingratitude of one who rewards <I>ahab</I> with <I>satan</I>,
&quot;enmity&quot;.
<P>
Hebrew parallelism can be helpful in determining the various shades
of meaning:
<P>
1. The one who loves someone &quot;cleaves&quot; to him (Heb.
<I>dabaq</I>: see Deut. 11:22; 30:20; Prov. 18:24; and 1 Kings
11:2).
<P>
2. The one who loves someone &quot;runs&quot; after him (Heb.
<I>radaph</I>: see Psalm 23:6 and Is. 1:23).
<P>
3. The one who loves someone &quot;goes after him&quot; (Heb.
<I>halak ahare</I>: see Jer. 2:25).
<P>
4. The one who loves someone &quot;seeks&quot; (Heb. <I> biqqesh</I>:
see Psalm 4:2; 40:16; 70:4).
<P>
5. The one who loves someone shows &quot;devotion&quot; to him
(Heb. <I>hesed</I>: see for instance Jer. 31:3 and Hosea 11:4).
<P>
6. The one who loves someone has his soul knit to the soul of
another (see 1 Sam. 18:1).
<P>
7. The one who loves someone is occupied with &quot;affectionate
desire&quot; (Heb. <I>haphes</I>: see Psalm 34:12).
<P>
8. The one who loves someone chooses the one he loves (Deut. 7:7-8;
10:15; Isaiah 41:8; Psalm 78:68).
<P>
9. The one who loves someone thinks the one chosen is lovely (2
Sam. 1:23).
<P>
10. The chosen one is precious (Isaiah 43:4).
<P>
11. The chosen one is honored (Isaiah 43:4; Psalm 87:2-3)
<P>
We may therefore conclude, that <I>ahab</I> is the passionate
desire to be intimately united with another person both inwardly
and outwardly, toward whom we feel great affection (cf. Gen. 2:23-24).
<P>
Botterweck and Ringgren make an interesting point in the <I>Theological
Dictionary of the Old Testament</I>:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
It is interesting that the root - <I>Richam</I>, &quot;to love
with compassion,&quot; which often appears in proper names as
an indication of God's love to the person wearing the name (or
giving the name), never appears as a parallel to <I>ahabh</I>,
while the root-<I>dodh</I>, significantly, occurs with <I>ahabh</I>
only in Cant. 1:3f. If we have not overestimated the implications
of these facts, they seem to show that the root <I>ahabh</I> in
the OT has a basic meaning which is to be sharply distinguished
from that of <I>racham</I>, and perhaps also from that of <I>dodh</I>,
which prevents it from being used in connection with a divine
name or from functioning as divine appellative in proper names.
Consequently, the Hebrew of the OT has filled the concept of <I>ahabh(ah)</I>
with an entirely independent meaning.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Interestingly enough, the Septuagint uses the verb <I>agapao</I>
as a translation for <I>ahab</I> in an overwhelming majority of
cases. In earlier Greek the differences in meaning between <I>erao</I>,
<I>phileo</I>, and <I>agapao</I> is very indistinct. According
to the<I> Theological Dictionary of the Old Testament</I>, <I>agapao</I>
means simply &quot;to be content with something&quot;. However,
since the translators of the Septuagint chose to render Hebrew
words built from the root <I>ahab</I> by forms of <I>agapao</I>,
it developed its later New Testament meaning. This also indicates
that the Hebrew root <I>ahab</I> could not be easily expressed
by the Greek words <I>phileo</I> or<I> erao</I> because its fundamental
meaning did not correspond to either of these two words.
<P>
<I>Agapao</I> may be considered the Greek equivalent to <I>ahab</I>,
even though <I>agapao</I> is sometimes used for the Hebrew words
<I>ratsah</I>,&quot;desire&quot;, <I>richam</I>, &quot;compassion&quot;,
and <I>haphes</I>, &quot;desire&quot;.
<P>
The scope of the word <I>ahab</I> as it is used in the Old Testament
is wide. It is used of:
<P>
1. Parent to child (Gen. 22:2; 25:28; 37:3; 44:20; Prov. 13:24;
2 Sam. 13:21)
<P>
2. Opposite sex for one another (Gen. 24:67; 29:18, 30; 29:32;
34:3; Judges 14:16; 16:4, 15; 1 Sam. 1:5; 18:20; 2 Sam. 13:1,
4)
<P>
3. Mother-in-law to daughter-in-law (Ruth 4:15)
<P>
4. Between neighbors (Lev. 19:18, 34)
<P>
5. Friends (1 Sam. 16:21; Job 17:1; 2 Sam. 19:7)
<P>
6. Servant and master (Ex. 21:5; Deut. 15:16)
<P>
7. People and military leader (1 Sam. 18:16, 22)
<P>
8. Teacher and student (Prov. 9:8)
<P>
9. Strangers (Lev. 19:34; Deut. 10:18, 19)
<P>
10. Yahweh and Israel (Deut. 10:12; 11:13, 22; 19:9; 30:6; Josh.
22:5; 23:11; Jer. 2:2)
<P>
The attitude of human love for God is also apparent in the Israelites'
love for Jerusalem, Yahweh's sanctuary, and Zion (Isaiah 66:10;
Lam. 1:2; Psalm 122:6). But all of this is founded on God's love
for Israel, which motivates Him to both punish and save them (Hos.
11:4; 9:15; Jer. 31:3; Isaiah 43:4; 63:9; ZEphesians 3:17; Mal.
1:2; Deut. 7:8, 13; 10:15; 23:5; 2 Chron. 2:11; 9:8).
<P>
<I>Ahab</I> and its derivatives in the Old Testament have a very
pragmatic character. <I>Ahab</I> presupposes an inner disposition
which is strengthened by experiences and events, and it includes
a conscious act on behalf of the person who is loved or the thing
that is preferred. According to the <I>Theological Dictionary
of the Old Testament</I>, perhaps the most impressive statement
of the pragmatic character of <I>ahab</I> is found in 1 Sam. 18:1-4:
<P>
Jonathan made a covenant with David, because he loved him as his
own soul, and Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon
him, and gave it to David, and his armor, and even his sword and
his bow and his girdle.
<P>
A covenant was formed between David and Jonathan because Jonathan
had <I>ahab</I> for David. There were certain concrete items given
by Jonathan to confirm the reality of the covenant - to confirm
his <I>ahab</I> for David.
<P>
The attitude of <I>ahab</I> is illustrated well by Genesis 29:18-20:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Jacob was in love with Rachel and said, &quot;I'll work for you
seven years in return for your younger daughter Rachel.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Laban said, &quot;It's better to give her to you than to some
other man. Stay here and serve me.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
So Jacob served seven years to get Rachel, but they seemed like
only a few days to him because of his love for her.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The practical consequence of love is expressed by Proverbs 10:12:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Hatred stirs up strife, but love covers over all offenses.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
It is this attitude of <I>ahab</I> which is responsible for God'swillingness
to forgive sin, and his reluctance to punish:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Say to them, &quot;As surely as I live,&quot; declares Yahweh,
&quot;I take no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but rather
that they turn from their ways and live. Turn! Turn from your
evil ways! Why will you die, O house of Israel?&quot; (Ezekiel
33:11)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<I>Ahab</I> must be expressed by action. The Israel that loves
God follows him in obedience:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I remember the devotion of your youth, your love as a bride, how
you followed me in the wilderness, in a land not sown. (Jer. 2:2)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
In the same way, what Yahweh did on behalf of his people is explained
by his love for them:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Yahweh appeared to us in the past, saying:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;I have loved you with an everlasting love;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I have drawn you with devotion.&quot; [Jer. 31:3]
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I led them with cords of human kindness,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
with ties of love;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I lifted the yoke from their neck
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
and bent down to feed them. [Hos. 11:4]
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Because of God's <I>ahab</I> for Israel, he formed a covenant
and gave Israel <I>hesed</I>. It was because of love and compassion
alone that Yahweh saved them, lifted them up, and sustained them.
In Deuteronomy 7:8 Moses writes:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
But it was because Yahweh loved you and kept the oath he swore
to your forefathers that he brought you out with a mighty hand
and redeemed you from the land of slavery, from the power of Pharaoh,
king of Egypt.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
And in Deuteronomy 10:15 he writes:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Yet Yahweh set his affection on your forefathers and loved them,
and he chose you their descendants, above all the nations, as
it is today.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The covenant that God forms with people unites them, resulting
in <I>hesed</I> - &quot;devotion&quot; - between them.
<P>
Hosea uses the concept of love between a husband and wife to express
this relationship between God and his people. Marriage is understood
as a covenant (Mal. 2:14). Hosea may speak apologetically against
Canaanite practices, because he is committed to the concept of
marital fidelity, and strongly opposes the mere gratification
of sexual lust. It is clear that in Hosea devotion is expressed
in a loving attitude toward the person loved. God tells Hosea
to marry a prostitute, and to love her even when she has gone
after another man. Loving this harlot is a picture of Yahweh's
love for His unfaithful people. The reason discord existed in
Hosea's marriage is because Gomer did not remain faithful to him.
She did not act in a manner consistent with love, but went after
others. At Peor, Israel had already shown her infidelity (Hosea
9:10). After the settlement in the land of Canaan she looked on
the gifts of the soil, not as gifts from Yahweh, but rather as
gifts from Baal (Hosea 2:8). Thus, Israel's failure to reciprocate
in love is an expression of her inner alienation from God (Hosea
8:9). Israel lowered herself to the level of a prostitute, provoking
God's wrath - the inhibiting aspect of the covenant.
<P>
The book of Deuteronomy is the bedrock of the covenant relation
between God and Israel. One of the intentions of the book was
to teach Israel her duty to reciprocate God's love, not just as
an emotion, but as genuine obedience and pure devotion (cf. Jer.
2:2). The only possible way for Israel to live was in love and
fidelity to Yahweh. Moses writes in Deuteronomy 6:5:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
You shall love Yahweh your God with all your heart, and with all
your soul, and with all your might.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
People often ask, &quot;How can love be commanded?&quot; If we
recognize that love is not <I>just</I> emotion and warm fuzzies,
but rather involves behavior and obedience, then it becomes possible
to understand how God can command people to love. Yahweh calls
on his people to keep his commandments because of their love (Deut.
5:10; 7:9; Psalm 119:47, 48, 97, 113, 119, 127, 140, 159, 163,
165, and 167), to serve him (Deut. 10:12; 11:13), to obey his
voice (Deut. 30:20), to walk in his ways, and to adhere closely
to him (Deut. 11:22; 19:9).
<P>
Yahweh's love is the prototype for love in general. He gives out
of his own initiative, but he desires that his people unite themselves
to him alone. When the people have agreed to his conditions and
accept his covenant, then they are bound to God in <I>hesed</I>
- &quot;covenant loyalty and devotion&quot;.
<P>
This love of just and obedient behavior constrains people even
more when they are convinced that God himself loves justice and
righteousness (cf. also Psalm 33:5; 37:28). Thus the Israelites
are forced to make a decision:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
See, I have set before you this day life and good, death and evil.
If you obey the commandments of Yahweh your God which I command
you this day, by loving Yahweh your God, by walking in his ways,
and by keeping his commandments and his statutes and his ordinances,
then you shall live and multiply, and Yahweh your God will bless
you in the land which you are entering to take possession of it.
(Deut. 30:15-16).
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
God's love for his people is connected to their responsibility,
like the responsibility of a vassal to his lord. A failure to
love and obey Yahweh would bring a curse on Israel - God's wrath,
the inhibiting side of God's love.
<P>
The commandments and laws are not burdens to Israel, but are kept
for the sake of love; and if this is the case, Yahweh will give
the affirming side of his love. Yahweh is not a somber lawgiver,
but a loving Father who wants to take care of his people; as a
result, He expects fidelity and devotion (<I>hesed</I>) in their
whole manner of life. In fact, the other nations must be able
to see their love and acknowledge it. According to Judges 5:31,
&quot;the friends [of Yahweh] must be like the sun as he rose
in his might.&quot; Nehemiah applies this doctrine to Israel's
history: Yahweh &quot;keeps covenant and steadfast love (<I>hesed</I>)
with those who love him and keep his commandments.&quot; In their
interest, Yahweh is against the enemies of his people, but also
very severe to those of his people who break His commands. It
is against this background that the affirming side of love is
contrasted with the inhibiting side, the wrath of God, and the
fear of God.
<P>
<I><B>HESED</B></I> 
<P>
<I>Hesed</I> is perhaps the single most difficult word to translate
from Hebrew to English. It has the sense of goodness, kindness,
affection, loving kindness, and perhaps most importantly, loyalty
and devotion. The sense of the knowledge of God and the fear of
God are also part of the word <I>hesed</I>, at least when it is
used to express the relationship between God and the Israelites.
<P>
Nelson Glueck has written the definitive work on the word <I>hesed</I>;
entitled <I>Hesed in the Bible</I>, it was first published in
1927. He explains that the word <I>hesed</I> always indicated
some kind of relationship: host to guest, allies to one another,
friends to friends, rulers to other rulers, and most significantly,
God to his people. <BR>
<I>Hesed</I> implies relationship and indicates a deep and lasting
affection. And it implies at the very least an agreement or vital
relationship between individuals or peoples, even if a formal
covenant is not in view. Leon Morris, in <I>Testament of Love</I>,
writes:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Most scholars agree with Glueck that the term makes a more general
reference to relationship, whether the tie be a covenant bond
or some other kind. Walther Zimmerli, for example, thinks that
&quot;the nature of hesedh is conduct in relation, and demonstration
of this relation. It is grace shown, or ready to show itself,
in relation.&quot; It is too much to say that the word originates
in the usages of covenant. We can say however, that it is the
right word to designate the attitude that the partners of a covenant
ought to have toward one another.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Glueck writes:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
...<I>Hesed</I> is not some kind of arbitrary assistance, but
rather that which members of the covenant are obligated to practice
reciprocally. This meaning of<U> </U><I>hesed</I> as the faithful,
mutual assistance among people who are bound together by a covenantal
relationship mirrors, perhaps, the original meaning of the word.
Groups were formed so that through reciprocal assistance common
dangers could be combated and overall security established. This
distinct kind of aid, as well as the whole relationship in accord
with the rights and obligations of this community, was called
<I>hesed</I>.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The best way of determining the meaning of a given biblical concept
is to examine its usage in context. A detailed and comprehensive
examination may be found in Appendix 2 at the end of this book.
The understanding gained there is assumed for what follows.
<P>
<I>Hesed</I> has its fullest exposition in the relationship that
existed between God and Israel. <I>Hesed</I>, to the Israelites,
is the love and loyalty, the devotion, the truth, the trust, the
faithfulness guaranteed by God to the nation of Israel as the
result of the covenant, or contract, he made with them as a result
of the love (<I>ahab</I>) he had for them. Look at Deuteronomy
7:7-9:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Yahweh did not set his affection on you and choose you because
you were more numerous than other peoples, for you were the fewest
of all peoples. But it was because Yahweh loved (<I>ahab</I>)
you and kept the oath he swore to your forefathers that he brought
you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you from the land of slavery,
from the power of pharaoh, king of Egypt.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
God promised to give benefits to the Israelites if they kept their
half of the bargain; this is the positive, or affirmative side
of <I>hesed</I>. However, there is an inhibitive side to God's
love: if the Israelites did not obey, if they did not worship
Yahweh alone, if they did not treat their neighbors with love,
then the covenant promised God's wrath as a consequence. The covenant,
formed because God had love (<I>ahab</I>) for Israel, placed demands
on God and Israel both. Israel must obey. God must bless. But
if Israel disobeys, God must curse. Within <I>hesed</I> is included
both blessing and cursing. This created a certain tension, most
clearly displayed in Hosea 11:7-11:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
My people are hung up on turning from me;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
they call him &quot;High God&quot;, who will never raise them
up.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
How can I give you up, Ephraim?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Will I deliver you up, Israel?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
How can I give you up as Admah?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Will I put you down as Zeboiim?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
My mind is turning over inside me.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
My emotions are jumbled together.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Will I not carry out my burning anger?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Will I not return to devastate Ephraim?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Since I am God,and not man -
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
the Holy One in your midst -
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
will I not come in wrath? (my translation)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Because God loves Israel - because he has <I>ahab</I> for her,
he would rather not harm her. Look at Ezekiel 33:11:
<P>
Say to them, &quot;As surely as I live, declares the Lord Yahweh,
I take no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but rather that
they turn from their ways and live. Turn! Turn from your evil
ways! Why will you die, O house of Israel?&quot;
<P>
However, because he has established a covenant, because of the
<I>hesed</I> of that covenant, God is required to bring the inhibiting
side of his love - the negative side of the covenant. A human
being might not be able to actually execute the promised punishment
against a dearly loved individual. However, he is God, not man
- and despite his inner turmoil - he will do as he promised. God
always keeps his word, even when it is painful to him.
<P>
<I>RAHAM, RHAHAMIM, RAHUM, RAHAMANI</I> 
<P>
<I>Introduction </I>
<P>
This root, which occurs 133 times in the Old Testament, refers
to the deep love, usually of a superior for an inferior, that
is based on some natural bond. There is an emphasis on the graciousness
with which it is extended.
<P>
<I>Usage </I>
<P>
The verbal root <I>raham</I> is related to the noun<I> rehem </I>-
womb; in Jeremiah 21:7 it is used of a mother's love for her nursing
baby. It is used of a father's love at least once, in Psalm 103:13.
<P>
<I>Raham</I> seems to connote the feeling of mercy which people
have for each other simply because they are human beings (Jeremiah
50:42). It is a feeling most easily prompted by small babies (Isaiah
13:18) or other helpless people; it is the natural mercy for the
helpless that Israel's enemies lack because of cruelty (Isaiah
13:18; Jeremiah 6:23) - although God may occasionally give Israel's
enemies such compassion (1 Kings 8:50; Jeremiah 42:12).
<P>
The root<I> raham</I> is frequently used of God, where it expresses
several concepts:
<P>
1) It denotes the strong tie God has with those whom he has called
as his children (Psalm 103:13). God looks on his people as a father
looks at his children, and has pity on them (Micah 7:17).
<P>
2) It clarifies the sovereign choice of God. God is gracious and
merciful [raham] to whomever he chooses (Exodus 33:19).
<P>
3) It describes his mercy and forgiveness toward his people in
the face of deserved judgment and upon the condition of their
repentance (Deut. 13:17).
<P>
4) It is God's mercy and grace in preserving his unrepentant people
from judgment (2 Kings 13:23; Ezekiel 33:11).
<P>
5) The attribute becomes the basis, partially at least, of an
eschatological hope (Isaiah 14:1; 49:13; 54:7; Jeremiah 12:15;
33:26; Ezekiel 34:25; Micah 7:19; Zechariah 1:16). Deuteronomy
30:3 prophesies that the exile results from Israel's sin, but
stipulates that repentance will meet with God's compassion [raham].
During the exile Israel's leaders encouraged the people with God's
electing love and mercy (Lamentations 3:32), and led them to humble
themselves in repentance, calling on God to reinstate his father-like
compassion (Zechariah 1:12). The restitution of the father-son
relationship and the return from exile bear witness to God's loving
care (Hosea 2:23).
<P>
<I>The Inhibitive Side of Love </I>
<P>
The wrath of God is not a popular topic, yet it is common throughout
the Bible and we must, therefore, examine and understand it with
some thoroughness. It is very enjoyable and easy to study the
warm, bright side of God's love, examining in detail only the
blessings promised under the covenant. In ancient Israel, in fact,
the people concentrated their attention wholly on this side of
God's love, failing to recognize that the blessings were dependent
on obedience. Look at Hosea 6:1-3:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Come, let us return to Yahweh.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
He has torn us to pieces
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
but he will heal us;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
he has injured us
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
but he will bind up our wounds.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
After two days he will revive us;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
on the third day he will restore us,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
that we may live in his presence.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Let us acknowledge Yahweh;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
let us press on to acknowledge him.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
As surely as the sun rises,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
he will appear;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
he will come to us like the winter rains,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
like the spring rains that water the earth.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
As L.C. Allen said so well in commenting on this passage:
<P>
The people speak with spurious words of repentance representing
God in terms of Canaanite fertility religion - just a metaphysical
machine under human control which automatically delivers the goods
when the money is delivered and the button is pressed.
<P>
The people of Israel failed to understand who God is, or what
he expects.
<P>
To concentrate on just the blessings of God's love, on only the
things considered wonderful and pleasant, would leave the reader
with a one-sided, warped view of God. First, we must understand
that it is certainly clear from scripture that God does not behave
toward his people with wicked intentions. Look at Proverbs 3:11-12:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
My son, do not despise Yahweh's discipline
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
and do not resent his rebuke,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
because Yahweh disciplines those he loves [<I>ahab</I>],
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
as a father the son he delights in.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
See also Hebrews 12:10-11:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Our fathers disciplined us for a little while as they thought
best; but God disciplines us for our good, that we may share in
his holiness. No discipline seems pleasant at the time, but painful.
Later on, however, it produces a harvest of righteousness and
peace for those who have been trained by it.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
As these two passages make clear, the love of God does not prevent
necessary punishment. In fact, God's love insures that punishment
will in fact occur. It is only if God failed to have love for
a person that he would fail to discipline him. Look at Hebrews
again (12:8):
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If you are not disciplined (and everyone undergoes discipline),
then you are illegitimate children and not true sons.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
That God's wrath should be closely related to God's love may seem
puzzling - even contradictory - at first. Yet it really should
not surprise anyone. This same God - of whom John wrote, He &quot;is
love&quot; (1 John 4:8b) - is also the God of wrath:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
You alone are to be feared.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Who can stand before you when you are angry?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
From heaven you pronounced judgment,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
and the land feared and was quiet -
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
when you, O God, rose up to judge,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
to save all the afflicted of the land. <I>Selah</I>.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Surely your wrath against men brings you praise,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
and the survivors of your wrath are restrained. (Psalm 76:7-10)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
God is a righteous judge,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
a God who expresses his wrath every day. (Psalm 7:10)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
&quot;Wrath, judgment and anger as aspects of God's love? Weird!
Surely it must be necessary to distort the scriptures to conclude
that!&quot; So might some initially react to the concept. But
look at Psalm 136:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good.

<P>
A reading through this psalm reveals that the judgment of God
on his enemies - and the enemies of his people - is an expression
of his love - his <I>hesed</I>. To ask &quot;how can this be?&quot;
is a legitimate question only if we accept first the reality that
God's wrath is an expression of his love, thereby making our question
actually, &quot;please explain how this can be,&quot; rather than
&quot;please prove it is so&quot;, since the proof is inescapable.
<P>
It is clear from Psalm 136 that a single action by God can be
seen by the righteous as affirming, and at the same time, by the
wicked as inhibitive. This means that divine actions which a human
being might describe as either love or wrath are indeed <I>both
</I>love and wrath; but which of the two words he will use to
describe God's deeds remains dependent on that viewer's perspective.
As human beings, when we are looking at God's activities, we generally
have less than complete data. Our attempts at understanding are
often akin to the difficulties faced by the group of blind people
attempting to arrive at a consistent description of an elephant.
<P>
Look at Romans 12:17-21:
<P>
Do not repay anyone evil for evil. Be careful to do what is right
in the eyes of everybody. If it is possible, as far as it depends
on you, live at peace with everyone. Do not take revenge, my friends,
but leave room for God's wrath, for it is written: &quot;It is
mine to avenge; I will repay,&quot; says the Lord. On the contrary,
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If your enemy is hungry,feed him;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
if he is thirsty, give him something to drink.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
In doing this, you will heap burning coals on his head.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Our enemies may interpret our love for them as a negative thing.
Look at Matthew 5:43-48:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
You have heard that it was said, &quot;Love your neighbor and
hate your enemy.&quot; But I tell you: Love your enemies and pray
for those who persecute you that you may be sons of your Father
in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good,
and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous. If you love
those who love you, what reward will you get? Are not even the
tax collectors doing that? And if you greet only your brothers,
what are you doing more than others? Do not even pagans do that?
Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The sun shown over Gibeon in the days of Joshua, and delayed going
down about a day. For the Israelites, it was a great benefit;
for the Amorites it meant death (Joshua 10:1-15). In the days
of Noah the rain came down, destroying the wicked, but in the
Ark, Noah was safe (Genesis 6-8). The sun can be either a blessing
or a curse; rain can be either a blessing or a curse. The context
makes all the difference, and so it is with God's actions toward
the human race. For the righteous, his acts are perceived as blessing;
for the wicked, they are described as wrath.
