<H1>What Is This?</H1>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In case you are wondering about this odd script, you might 
be interested to know that it is the first two words of the Babylonian creation epic.  The epic is called <i>Enuma elish</i>, which translates as "When on high".<P>
Portions of <i>Enuma elish</i> were first made available in modern times by George Smith in 1876.  So far, there is no general agreement as to the date that <i>Enuma elish</i> was first written.  The extant texts all date from after 1000 BC.  However, internal evidence suggests to most scholars a date of composition during the Old Babylonian period -- that is, the early part of the second millennium BC.<br>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Below are the opening few lines:<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
When on high the heaven had not been named,<BR>
And firm ground below had not been named,<BR>
Then only ancient Apsu, their father,<BR>
And Tiamat, their mother, existed.<BR>
Their waters were mixed, forming a single body.<BR>
No reed hut had been built,<BR>
No wetlands had appeared.<BR>
When no gods whatever had been made:<BR>
Without names and their destinies undetermined --<BR>
Then it was that the gods were formed within Apsu and Tiamat.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B>Note:</B> Apsu is the god of fresh water and Tiamat is the goddess of salt water, that is, the sea.<P>
