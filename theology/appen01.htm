 Presuppositions of modern science that also underlie Christianity:

<P>
<B> Axiom 1:</B> There is an actually existing, objectively real, external
universe. 
<P>
<B> Axiom 2:</B> The external universe is attainable accurately by our
senses. 
<P>
<B> Axiom 3:</B> The external universe is orderly and endowed with cause
and effect and it follows the laws of logic.
<P>
 A question rises at this point: has the universe always existed, or did it have a beginning?  It is now almost universally accepted that: 
<P>
<B> Axiom 4:</B> The external universe had a beginning. 
<P>
 The above four axioms are the points of agreement between theists and non-theists. The differences arise with the next axiom:
<P>
<B> Axiom 5:</B> If the universe had a beginning, then --

Based on how the above axiom is worded, the development in thinking then will branch markedly between a theist and a non-theist:

<P>
 Obviously the answer to the question of <I>how</I> the universe
began will differ markedly based on the presuppositions underlying
it.  Notice that the cause of four extra steps on the theistic
side is necessitated by first determining the nature of the cause
of the universe, before tackling the<I> how </I>of the universe.

<P>
 As an example of how this chart works out practically, take the
question of evolution vs. creationism.  Frankly, it is rarely discussed
properly.  The above presuppositions must first be established,
and any worthwhile discussion between a theist and a non-theist
regarding the question is highly unlikely until then. In fact,
evolution vs. creationism is best argued between theists, where
there is some basic agreement on presuppositions. Discussions
between theists and non-theists would better take place at an
earlier presuppositional level; i.e. it is probably best to confine
discussion to the question of the existence of God.  For theists
and nontheists to discuss questions of origin and the how of creation
is nonsensical.
