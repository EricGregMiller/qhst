&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Quartz Hill School of Theology is an academic institution designed to
train believers for more effective ministry, both in and out of the church.
QHST affirms that each believer is a priest before God, indwelt by the
Holy Spirit, not needing any human intermediary to reach God and competent
to judge spiritual matters for him or herself.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Quartz Hill School of Theology is a ministry of <A HREF="church.htm">Quartz
Hill Community Church</A>, which is associated with the Southern Baptist
Convention.

(Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek) we also publish a journal: <A HREF="more.htm">Quartz
Hill Journal of Theology </A>
