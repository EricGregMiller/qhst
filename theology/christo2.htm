<B>The Office of Christ</B> 
<P>
<I>Prophet</I> 
<P>
The Bible makes clear that Jesus, in addition to his role as sacrifice
and the Son of God, is considered a prophet. In Deuteronomy 18:15-19
Moses tells the people to expect another prophet after him. The
fulfillment of this prediction was in the numerous prophets who
lived and ministered between the time of Moses and the time of
Christ, but it had its final fulfillment in the appearance of
Christ. Additionally, Matthew 3:13-17, Acts 3:22-26, and Acts
7:37 explicitly label Jesus as a prophet, and beyond that, we
see him making predictions that were later fulfilled, as for instance
in Matthew 24 and Luke 21, where he predicts the destruction of
the temple and Jerusalem.
<P>
What does a prophet do? He speaks for God to the people. This
involves more than simply predicting the future, though that is
clearly part of the prophetic office. After all, when asked how
to know a prophet is from God, the proof is that if what they
say does not come true, then they are not a prophet from God (Deuteronomy
18:22). Other tasks included in the prophetic service were teaching
and healing.
<P>
<I>Priest</I> 
<P>
In addition to being a prophet, the Son of God was also a priest,
standing as the ultimate and final mediator between God and humanity.
Hebrew 5:6-10 and Hebrews 7:11-28 makes explicit that he was a
priest after the order of Melchisedek. This Melchisedek priesthood
shows up two other places in the Bible: Genesis 14:18-20 and Psalm
110:4.
<P>
What is involved in this priesthood? First, reconciliation, which
was accomplished at Christ's first coming when he was crucified.
He became the sacrifice for our sins. Second, he intercedes for
us; this is being accomplished in heaven now, between Christ's
first and second comings. Finally, the ultimate redemption will
be accomplished upon his return This might be likened to the final,
priestly benediction (Genesis 14:19).
<P>
The Melchisedek priesthood is forever: &quot;A priest forever
after the order of Melchisedek&quot; (Psalm 110:4). This fulfillment
can only come through someone like Christ. What about the Aaronic
priesthood? Hebrews 9:6 speaks of it being a pattern of what was
to come. In ministry Jesus fulfills the Levitical pattern (cf.
Heb. 5:6, 6:20, 7:1-10, 21).
<P>
But more than that, Jesus must be a Levite as much as he is the
Son of David. Consider the following from Jeremiah:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
For this is what the LORD says: 'David will never fail to have
a man to sit on the throne of the house of Israel, nor will the
priests, who are Levites, ever fail to have a man to stand before
me continually to offer burnt offerings, to burn grain offerings
and to present sacrifices.'&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;This is what the LORD says: 'If you can break my covenant
with the day and my covenant with the night, so that day and night
no longer come at their appointed time, then my covenant with
David my servant--and my covenant with the Levites who are priests
ministering before me--can be broken and David will no longer
have a descendant to reign on his throne. I will make the descendants
of David my servant and the Levites who minister before me as
countless as the stars of the sky and as measureless as the sand
on the seashore.'&quot; (Jeremiah 33:17-22)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Yet Hebrews 7:11-17 makes it clear:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If perfection could have been attained through the Levitical priesthood
(for on the basis of it the law was given to the people), why
was there still need for another priest to come-one in the order
of Melchizedek, not in the order of Aaron? For when there is a
change of the priesthood, there must also be a change of the law.
He of whom these things are said belonged to a different tribe,
and no one from that tribe has ever served at the altar. For it
is clear that our Lord descended from Judah, and in regard to
that tribe Moses said nothing about priests. And what we have
said is even more clear if another priest like Melchizedek appears,
one who has become a priest not on the basis of a regulation as
to his ancestry but on the basis of the power of an indestructible
life. For it is declared:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;You are a priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
So Jesus would not seem to be descended from Levi at all, but
solely from the tribe of Judah. But then that would seem to create
problems with the prophesy of Jeremiah. What are we going to do?
Consider an interesting point:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
In the time of Herod king of Judea there was a priest named Zechariah,
who belonged to the priestly division of Abijah; his wife Elizabeth
was also a descendant of Aaron. (Luke 1:5)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Even Elizabeth your relative is going to have a child in her old
age, and she who was said to be barren is in her sixth month.
(Luke 1:36)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The word translated &quot;relative&quot; was used to refer to
someone of the same tribe. According to Luke, Elizabeth was descended
from Aaron; she was also a &quot;relative&quot; of Mary. This
would suggest, then, that Mary was a descendent of Aaron, also.
Therefore, through his mother, Jesus was in the line of Aaron,
and therefore can literally and physically fulfill the prophesy
of Jeremiah!
<P>
<I>King </I>
<P>
Jesus is the King of Israel, descended from the house of David.
This fulfills such Old Testament passages as Jeremiah 33:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
For this is what the LORD says: 'David will never fail to have
a man to sit on the throne of the house of Israel, nor will the
priests, who are Levites, ever fail to have a man to stand before
me continually to offer burnt offerings, to burn grain offerings
and to present sacrifices.'&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;This is what the LORD says: 'If you can break my covenant
with the day and my covenant with the night, so that day and night
no longer come at their appointed time, then my covenant with
David my servant-and my covenant with the Levites who are priests
ministering before me-can be broken and David will no longer have
a descendant to reign on his throne. I will make the descendants
of David my servant and the Levites who minister before me as
countless as the stars of the sky and as measureless as the sand
on the seashore.'&quot; (Jeremiah 33:17-22)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The reality of his relationship to David is made clear from the
the genealogies preserved in Matthew 1 and Luke 3. If the Jesus
is not the Messiah, and a physical descendent of David, and the
Son of God raised to life the third day, then the prophesy of
Jeremiah has failed, because there has not been a king of Israel,
descended from David, since the destruction of the southern kingdom
by Nebuchadnezzar in 586/5 BC.
<P>
<B>The Baptism of Christ</B> 
<P>
If nothing else, Jesus' baptism should demonstrate that baptism
has nothing to do with salvation since certainly Jesus did not
need to be saved. The concept of baptismal regeneration would
have serious difficulty handling the fact that Jesus was baptized,
as recorded in Matthew 3:13-17, Mark 1:9-11, Luke 3:21-22, and
John 1:29-34.
<P>
So why did Jesus get baptized? The baptism had Jewish significance,
for one thing. Jesus did lots of &quot;Jewish&quot; things because
he was Jewish. He was circumcized the 8th day, he was presented
at the temple as their first born son (Luke 2:21-22), he participated
in Synagogue worship (Luke 4:16), and in the holidays (John 10:21-22;
Matthew 26:17; Luke 22:7-8, John 2:23; 4:45). Likewise, baptism
was a Jewish rite of passage. It was Christ's induction into his
public ministry. The common idea is that he was anointed to his
priestly or public ministry. (Cf. Exodus 24:4-7) Whether prophetic
or priestly, it was certainly public (Matthew 3:16ff)
<P>
The specific statement in the Bible was that the baptism was to
&quot;fullfill all righteousness.&quot; How did it do this? Perhaps
in the fact that it identified Christ with sinful humanity and
spoke of his coming death (Mark. 1:9-15). Although its mode was
immersion, the baptism of Christ was not the pattern for believer's
baptism. We do not <I>follow</I> Jesus in baptism, we <I>obey</I>
him in baptism.
<P>
Jesus' baptistm was obviously an important event in Jesus life
- otherwise it wouldn't have been mentioned - but it is one of
the least understood events.
<P>
<B>The Temptation of Christ</B> 
<P>
Jesus experienced temptation according to several biblical references.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with
our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every
way, just as we are-yet was without sin (Hebrews 4:15).
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The temptation episode is described in Matthew 4:1-11 (cf. Mark
1:12-13, Luke 4:1-13, and Hebrews 2:18)
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the desert to be tempted
by the devil. After fasting forty days and forty nights, he was
hungry. The tempter came to him and said, &quot;If you are the
Son of God, tell these stones to become bread.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Jesus answered, &quot;It is written: 'Man does not live on bread
alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.'&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Then the devil took him to the holy city and had him stand on
the highest point of the temple. &quot;If you are the Son of God,&quot;
he said, &quot;throw yourself down. For it is written:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;'He will command his angels concerning you,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
and they will lift you up in their hands,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.'&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Jesus answered him, &quot;It is also written: 'Do not put the
Lord your God to the test.'&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him
all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor. &quot;All this
I will give you,&quot; he said, &quot;if you will bow down and
worship me.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Jesus said to him, &quot;Away from me, Satan! For it is written:
'Worship the Lord your God, and serve him only.'&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Then the devil left him, and angels came and attended him.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
We have already pointed out that Jesus was God. Yet, James 1:13
makes the statement that &quot;God cannot be tempted.&quot; Does
this then contradict the biblical accounts that refer to Jesus
being tempted? Does it mean, perhaps, that Jesus is not God?
<P>
Hardly. It must have been in an area of Jesus' humanity that he
was tempted. According to Philippians 2:6-7 Jesus emptied himself.
The Bible also indicates that God is not a man, yet Jesus clearly
was a man. We also know that God can't die, yet that is precisely
what Jesus did. Therefore, the temptation was possible precisely
because he was a human being, and precisely in the same way that
the first man was tempted. Jesus is called a second Adam (1 Corinthians
15:45), and in the same way the first Adam fell to temptation,
so the second Adam resisted it.
<P>
Some ask the question: could Jesus have succumbed to the temptation
and sinned? That is, to use technical terms was he peccable (able
to sin) or impeccable (unable to sin)? It really doesn't matter,
because the reality is, he did not sin; he successfully stood
up under the temptation. Whether he could have or not, doesn't
really matter.
<P>
Those who argue that he couldn't have sinned - couldn't have given
in to the temptation, will make the following points:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
a. He is immutable. Hebrews 13:8 states that he couldn't change
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
b. He is omnipotent. Therefore, how could the Devil ever overcomehim?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
c. He is omniscient. Jesus already knew the Devil's strategy,
and therefore would not be caught unawares or unprepared.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
d. It seems inconceivable, based on Jesus nature as divine, that
he could ever sin. If he was merely human, then it would make
sense, but he was not merely human.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
However, in answer to the above, it should be pointed out that
in his divinity he was immutable, omnipotent, and omniscient,
in his humanity he was none of those things. Otherwise, if he
were immutable, then how did he grow from infant to adulthood,
how did he die, and how did he become a man in the first place?
If he were omniscient, then why does Luke speak of him growing
in wisdom?
<P>
It also needs to be pointed out that one can be tempted to do
only what one wishes to do. For instance, waving a plate full
of liver in my face daily will never tempt me to eat it. I do
not like liver. Likewise, showing me naked pictures of guys does
not excite me. But wave a hamburger in front of me or naked women,
and my reaction will be very different. Then there is genuine
temptation.
<P>
It needs to be pointed out, too, that temptation is not the same
as sin. There is no sin in being tempted - in wanting to do something
you shouldn't do. The sin comes in actually giving in to the temptation.
Jesus, after not eating for forty days in the wilderness was genuinely
hungry. Therefore, he would have liked to have eaten. But he resisted
the temptation by Satan to eat on Satan's conditions.
<P>
But again, whether he was able to sin or not, the bottom line
is, he didn't - and that really is all that matters. Questions
of a hypothetical nature or just that, and therefore of limited
significance.
<P>
<B>The Transfiguration of Christ</B> 
<P>
Matthew 16:28-17:9 presents an interesting and unique event (also
recorded in Luke 9:28-36 and Mark 9:2-13):
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;I tell you the truth, some who are standing here will not
taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
After six days Jesus took with him Peter, James and John the brother
of James, and led them up a high mountain by themselves. There
he was transfigured before them. His face shone like the sun,
and his clothes became as white as the light. Just then there
appeared before them Moses and Elijah, talking with Jesus.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Peter said to Jesus, &quot;Lord, it is good for us to be here.
If you wish, I will put up three shelters-one for you, one for
Moses and one for Elijah.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
While he was still speaking, a bright cloud enveloped them, and
a voice from the cloud said, &quot;This is my Son, whom I love;
with him I am well pleased. Listen to him!&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
When the disciples heard this, they fell facedown to the ground,
terrified. But Jesus came and touched them. &quot;Get up,&quot;
he said. &quot;Don't be afraid.&quot; When they looked up, they
saw no one except Jesus.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus instructed them,
&quot;Don't tell anyone what you have seen, until the Son of Man
has been raised from the dead.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The mountain where this occured is traditionally identified as
Mt. Tabor. It looks like an upside down bowl - perfectly smooth
and round. So what happened here? There was obviously a literal
physical change of some sort. Based on the placing of the episode,
it obviously in some way fulfills the statement that &quot;some
here will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming
in his kingdom.&quot;
<P>
What does this mean? Is the transfiguration to be understood as
the kingdom of God, revealed early to the disciples? Or are we
to suggest that Christ made a mistake and the second coming and
the eternal kingdom didn't arrive as planned - or can we make
something of what John wrote?
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Jesus answered, &quot;If I want him to remain alive until I return,
what is that to you? You must follow me.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Because of this, the rumor spread among the brothers that this
disciple would not die. But Jesus did not say that he would not
die; he only said, &quot;If I want him to remain alive until I
return, what is that to you?&quot; (John 21:22-23)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
It is unlikely that John is still alive; or anyone else from that
period. Since Jesus has yet to come back, the fulfillment of his
words cannot refer to the still future second coming.
<P>
But, it may be an over simplification to suggest that this was
merely a &quot;lights and magic spectacular.&quot; Since God is
not bound by space and time, it is a possibility that what happened
on the mountain was not just a change in Jesus, but rather, a
change in location for the disciples, both spatially and temporally.
It might be easiest to understand what happened if we suggest
that they were moved through time to the end of everything, where
they experienced a glimpse of what that yet future day (for us)
would be like. If we understand the transformation in this way,
it makes the fulfillment of Christ's words in Matthew 16:28 more
literal than they otherwise would be.
<P>
The &quot;two men&quot; were not disembodied spirits. The disciples
recognized them, apparently without introduction. This may be
remarkable, demonstrating that when we reach the eternal kingdom
we will recognize each other, and perhaps people we don't know,
too. Or it could be that as Jesus talked to them, he called them
by name, or it could be simply that they were introduced and the
passage just doesn't tell us, since that's a minor thing and we
know that the Bible does not tell us everything that happened.
<P>
<B>The Garden Struggle</B> 
<P>
Jesus' struggle in prayer just before his arrest and subsequent
execution is described in Luke 22:39-46, Matthew 26:36-46, Mark
14:32-42, and John 18:11. Luke 22:42 records:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me; yet not
my will, but yours be done.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
A question arrises with this particular verse. What is the &quot;cup&quot;
that Jesus is talking about? There are at least three views on
this verse:
<P>
<I>1. Satan met Christ in the Garden and sought to kill him.</I>

<P>
The idea here is that Satan was trying to get Jesus before he
got to the cross. Luke 22:53 is used in support of the view:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;Every day I was with you in the temple courts, and you did
not lay a hand on me. But this is your hour-when darkness reigns.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Although Jesus speaks these words in the Garden, they seem severly
stretched as a reference to Satan. The problem with thinking that
Satan is the &quot;cup&quot; is quite obvious: there is no mention
of Satan in the text, nor is there any obvious reason for thinking
that he is a great concern to Jesus at this point. It also would
seem contradictory to the statement in 1 Corinthians 2:7-8:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
No, we speak of God's secret wisdom, a wisdom that has been hidden
and that God destined for our glory before time began. None of
the rulers of this age understood it, for if they had, they would
not have crucified the Lord of glory.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Rather than attempting to stop Jesus' crucifixion, the forces
of Satan seemed to have been actively orchistrating it, seeing
in that the frustration of God's plans, rather than their final
fulfillment and triumph. Satan was getting Jesus through Judas
(notice in Luke 22:3 and John 13:27 that Satan entered Judas just
before he sold Jesus out - the only place in the Bible that describes
Satan himself taking possession of an individual).
<P>
<I>2. Christ was afraid to die and pled to be relieved from his
proposed ministry.</I> 
<P>
Hebrews 5:7 makes the following statement:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
During the days of Jesus' life on earth, he offered up prayers
and petitions with loud cries and tears to the one who could save
him from death, and he was heard because of his reverent submission.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
His prayer was answered when he was resurrected, though it was
the Father's will that he should first die. Being a human being,
the chances seem good that the prospect of a painful death on
the cross was not something that Jesus looked forward to. So it
seems likely that this was probably part of what the &quot;cup&quot;
signifies. There may have been a little more to it than simply
a painful physical death that was bothering him, however.
<P>
<I>3. Gethsemane afforded Christ a final picture of what was involved
in Calvary - that is, the nature of the sacrifice. </I>
<P>
Jesus became a sacrifice for sin - he took on the ultimate penalty,
an infinite penalty, that was due the human race. That, in addition
to the painful physical death itself, would have given Jesus pause
(Cf. John 18:11, 1 Corinthians 11:25, Isaiah 53:10-11, John 8:29
and 2 Corinthians 5:21). Death, after all, is not the worst thing
that can happen to a human being.
<P>
<B>The Substitutionary Nature of the Death of Christ</B> 
<P>
Various words are used to describe what Jesus did for us on the
cross. The Bible tells us that Jesus &quot;atoned&quot; for us
- that is, he covered or pardoned our sin (Acts 3:25, Hebrews
2:17 and 1 John 2:2-4:10). Jesus &quot;reconciled&quot; us to
God; that is, that which had kept us apart from God was eliminated,
giving us free access to him. (Romans 5:11, Ephesians 2:16, 2
Corinthians 5:17-20 and Colossians 1:20-22). Jesus' death on the
cross &quot;liberated&quot; us from sin - we are no longer enslaved
to it. Our sin is &quot;expiated&quot; - God is satisfied with
the blood of Christ (Romans 3:25).
<P>
Christ's death on the cross is the payment made which constitutes
a ransom from sin (1 Timothy 2:6). Redemption is a vicarous ransom
on behalf of all; that is, Jesus was our substitute - he took
our place (Isa. 53:6, 11; Ex. 12:13; Zech. 13:7; Matthew 20:28;
John 1:29; Gal 1:4; Gal 3:13).
<P>
The Old Testament gives several pictures of substitution, all
of which are useful in trying to understand the nature of what
Jesus did for us on the cross:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
1. Genesis 3: the coats of skins instead of the fig leaves
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
2. Genesis 22: the ram in the thicket instead of Isaac
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
3. Genesis 44:33: Judah instead of Benjamin
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
4. Exodus 12:13: the Passover Lamb in place of the firstborn
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
5. Leviticus 16: The two goats instead of the sinful people.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
6. Numbers 19: The red heifer instead of the defiled Israelite.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
7. Zechariah 3: The rich apparel instead of Joshua's filthy garments.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<B>The Necessity of the Atoning Death</B> 
<P>
Without the death of Jesus on the cross for us, we would have
to die for our own sins; as finite creatures, we would suffer
infinitely. Jesus, as an infinite being, could suffer finitely.
The death of Jesus was necessitated by our sinful condition (Gen.
2:17; Romans 5:12; 2:15; 1 Corinthians 15:56; Ez. 18:4; Romans
6:23; Luk. 10:28; Jam. 2:10; Psa. 51:5; Ephesians 2:1-2 etc.).
<P>
<B>The Extent of the Atoning Death </B>
<P>
When Jesus died on the cross, he died for the &quot;sins of the
world&quot;. On the face of it, this would seem to suggest the
universal sufficiency of the atonement, that he made provision
for all humanity. The Bible also suggests that the efficiency
or efficacy of the atonment is limited. That is, it has actual
benefits only for those who accept it. Free will is not violated.
That is, those who do not believe do not receive atonement.
<P>
There are some questions about the nature of Christ's atonement,
however. Historically, two views on the extent of the atonement
exist: what is called limited atonement and what is called unlimited
atonement. Consider the following passages:
<P>
Universality of the atonement - that is, Unlimited Atonement

<P>
<B>Limited or Unlimited Atonement?</B> 
<P>
What is the issue? Did Jesus come with the design of or for the
purpose of saving only the elect or all humanity?
<P>
<I>Limited Atonement:</I> 
<P>
The arguement for limited atonement may be put in the form of
a syllogism:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The design of God is always efficacious
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Only some of are saved.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Therefore, God's design must have been to save the elect.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
It is clear, also, that Scripture sometimes qualifies those for
whom Christ died, as for instance in John 10:15 and Ephesians
5:25.
<P>
The scope of intercession is the same as substitution (John 17:9).
The scope of sacrifice equals the scope of intercession which
is the same as the elect. If he prays only for the elect and the
scope of the sacrifice and the scope of the intersession are equal,
then the sacrifice is only for the elect.
<P>
Additionally, unlimited atonement would seem to require universalism.
That is, if Jesus died for the entire world, then why can't the
entire world be saved, especially since salvation is a matter
of grace, not works, and even faith is a gift of God.
<P>
The word &quot;world&quot; sometimes means the &quot;elect&quot;,
and it is clear that the word &quot;all&quot; does not necessarily
mean &quot;universal&quot; (so for instance see 2 Corinthians
5:15; Heb. 2:9; 1 Corinthians 15:33).
<P>
Some passages which seem universalistic, such as 2 Peter 2:1 and
Hebrews 10:29 give merely the view of the people themselves, from
their own perspective.
<P>
<I>Unlimited Atonement</I> 
<P>
Those who believe that Jesus' death was for the whole world, and
not just the elect or the church, will point to passages such
as John 3:16-20; 3:36; 5:24-29; 20:3; 1 John 2:2; 4:14; Romans
10:17, and 2 Timothy 3:15.
<P>
The bearing of all sins is not equivalent to the saving of all
people. The blood of Christ does not determine all blessing in
any realm. The blood provides god with liberty to bless his forgiven
people. That is, the forgiveness of sins and our position in Christ
are secured through the cross. Freedom, under grace, apart from
a merit system, access to God, heavenly citizenship, etc., are
acts of benevolence expressed freely by God because of propitiation.
Equivolence is not in view.
<P>
Election, as in Romans 8:30 does not diminish because of a parallel
offer of salvation to all who believe.
<P>
Humans cannot reject what does not exist, nor can they be judged
for what is not related to them. (John 3:18)
<P>
Human responsiblity is virtually nullified apart from a bona fide
invitation to believe and be saved. Scripture continually puts
responsibility on humans to believe on Christ and be saved. We
dare not qualify this offer and say, that no provision for someone
to be saved has been made (John 8:24; 5:34)
<P>
<I>Conclusion</I> 
<P>
To some extent, the question of unlimited versus limited atonement
is like the question of whether Jesus could actually sin. The
results are the same in either case: that is, if Jesus' atonement
was unlimited, it is still only effective for those who believe.
And if he died only for the elect, then again, it is only effective
for those who believe. In effect, either theological position
results in the same outcome, and it is hard to say that one point
of view is more or less simple than the other. Therefore, neither
theory has obvious supperiority over the other and neither makes
a prediction different from the other. From the standpoint of
logic, however, limited atonement seems to have more going for
it, and it does remove the problem of universalism (that is, the
idea that everyone would be saved).
<P>
<B>Theories of Atonement</B> 
<P>
What exactly was involved in Christ's atoning death on the cross?
Several theories have arrisen over the centuries. Some of the
major ones include:
<P>
A. Recapitualation Theory
<P>
(Iraeneus) In his life and death, Christ was undergoing all the
experiences of humanity.
<P>
B. Commercial Theory
<P>
(Anselm) The suffering of Christ was to satisfy the honor of God.
<P>
C. Payment to Satan Theory
<P>
(Origen) Jesus pays Satan the price due him.
<P>
D. The Moral Influence Theory
<P>
(Abelard, Bushnell, Schliermacher, Ritschl, Origen) The death
of Christ was designed to reveal how much God loved us.
<P>
E. The Example Theory
<P>
(Socinian views; Taelius; Unitarians) Jesus death reveals the
way of obedience.
<P>
F. The Mystical Theory
<P>
(Schliermacher, Irving) Much like the moral influence theory.
Christ has a sin nature, but triumphed over it, and therefore
he changed humanity.
<P>
G. The Governmental Theory
<P>
(Hugh Grotius, 1583-1645, Wardlaw, Miley) Christ died as a token
of God's displeasure toward sin and it was accepted by God as
sufficient; but actually God does not exact strict justice. H.
Repentance Theory
<P>
(Macleod, Campbell) It assumes that a perfect repentance is sufficient
to atone for sin. In his death, Christ entered into the Father's
condemnation of sin, condemned sin, and by this, confessed it.
<P>
I. Substituional or Vicarious Theory (Orthodox position) Christ
died as our substitute, taking our place on the cross.
<P>
<B>The Burial of Christ</B> 
<P>
After his crucifixtion, Jesus was buried in the tomb of a rich
man, fulfilling the prophesy in Isaiah 53. Each of the four gospel
accounts speaks of his burial; the burial is significant because
it gives that much added proof to the fact that Jesus actually
died (Romans 6:2-4, 1 Corinthians 15:3-4, and Colossians 2:11-12).
We would be at a loss as to evidence if He had not been buried.
The burial further attests to his death.
<P>
As to salvation, the burial of Christ is typified by the &quot;scapegoat&quot;,
the emphasis being that Christ &quot;took away&quot; our sins.
The tomb obliterates the trace of sin, just as the wilderness
obliterated the trace of the scapegoat.
<P>
The burial also appears to be the ground of experimental sanctification
in that the power of such a nature was defeated.

<I>Importance </I>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Now, brothers, I want to remind you of the gospel I preached to
you, which you received and on which you have taken your stand.
By this gospel you are saved, if you hold firmly to the word I
preached to you. Otherwise, you have believed in vain.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance:
that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that
he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to
the Scriptures, and that he appeared to Peter, and then to the
Twelve. After that, he appeared to more than five hundred of the
brothers at the same time, most of whom are still living, though
some have fallen asleep. Then he appeared to James, then to all
the apostles, and last of all he appeared to me also, as to one
abnormally born. For I am the least of the apostles and do not
even deserve to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the
church of God. But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his
grace to me was not without effect. No, I worked harder than all
of them-yet not I, but the grace of God that was with me. Whether,
then, it was I or they, this is what we preach, and this is what
you believed.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
But if it is preached that Christ has been raised from the dead,
how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?
If there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ
has been raised. And if Christ has not been raised, our preaching
is useless and so is your faith. More than that, we are then found
to be false witnesses about God, for we have testified about God
that he raised Christ from the dead. But he did not raise him
if in fact the dead are not raised. For if the dead are not raised,
then Christ has not been raised either. And if Christ has not
been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins.
Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ are lost. If
only for this life we have hope in Christ, we are to be pitied
more than all men.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead, the firstfruits
of those who have fallen asleep. (1 Corinthians 15:1-20)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
If Jesus has not been raised from the dead, then the Christian
message is without any value whatsoever. The doctrine, therefore,
is prominent in apostolic teaching (Acts 4:33) and it is mentioned
about 100 times in the New Testament. It is central to the truth
of the Gospel message.

It was not just that Jesus fainted and then woke up. He was quite
dead.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
But when they came to Jesus and found that he was already dead,
they did not break his legs. Instead, one of the soldiers pierced
Jesus' side with a spear, bringing a sudden flow of blood and
water. (John 19:33-34)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
It was not just a &quot;vision&quot; of the resurrected Lord.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
He said to them, &quot;Why are you troubled, and why do doubts
rise in your minds? Look at my hands and my feet. It is I myself!
Touch me and see; a ghost does not have flesh and bones, as you
see I have.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
When he had said this, he showed them his hands and feet. And
while they still did not believe it because of joy and amazement,
he asked them, &quot;Do you have anything here to eat?&quot; They
gave him a piece of broiled fish, and he took it and ate it in
their presence. (Luke 24:38-43)

It was not just a myth.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;Men of Israel, listen to this: Jesus of Nazareth was a man
accredited by God to you by miracles, wonders and signs, which
God did among you through him, as you yourselves know. This man
was handed over to you by God's set purpose and foreknowledge;
and you, with the help of wicked men, put him to death by nailing
him to the cross. But God raised him from the dead, freeing him
from the agony of death, because it was impossible for death to
keep its hold on him. David said about him:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;'I saw the Lord always before me.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Because he is at my right hand,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I will not be shaken.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Therefore my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
my body also will live in hope,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
because you will not abandon me to the grave,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
nor will you let your Holy One see decay.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
You have made known to me the paths of life;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
you will fill me with joy in your presence.'
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;Brothers, I can tell you confidently that the patriarch
David died and was buried, and his tomb is here to this day. But
he was a prophet and knew that God had promised him on oath that
he would place one of his descendants on his throne. Seeing what
was ahead, he spoke of the resurrection of the Christ, that he
was not abandoned to the grave, nor did his body see decay. God
has raised this Jesus to life, and we are all witnesses of the
fact. Exalted to the right hand of God, he has received from the
Father the promised Holy Spirit and has poured out what you now
see and hear. For David did not ascend to heaven, and yet he said,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;'The Lord said to my Lord:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;Sit at my right hand
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.&quot; `
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;Therefore let all Israel be assured of this: God has made
this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
When the people heard this, they were cut to the heart and said
to Peter and the other apostles, &quot;Brothers, what shall we
do?&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Peter replied, &quot;Repent and be baptized, every one of you,
in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins.
And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. The promise
is for you and your children and for all who are far off - for
all whom the Lord our God will call.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
With many other words he warned them; and he pleaded with them,
&quot;Save yourselves from this corrupt generation.&quot; (Acts

He appeared in the same body in which he was crucified.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Now Thomas (called Didymus), one of the Twelve, was not with the
disciples when Jesus came. So the other disciples told him, &quot;We
have seen the Lord!&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
But he said to them, &quot;Unless I see the nail marks in his
hands and put my finger where the nails were, and put my hand
into his side, I will not believe it.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
A week later his disciples were in the house again, and Thomas
was with them. Though the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood
among them and said, &quot;Peace be with you!&quot; Then he said
to Thomas, &quot;Put your finger here; see my hands. Reach out
your hand and put it into my side. Stop doubting and believe.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Thomas said to him, &quot;My Lord and my God!&quot; (John 20:24-28)

The apostles believed in his resurrection and it changed their
lives forever.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
On the evening of that first day of the week, when the disciples
were together, with the doors locked for fear of the Jews, Jesus
came and stood among them and said, &quot;Peace be with you!&quot;
After he said this, he showed them his hands and side. The disciples
were overjoyed when they saw the Lord. (John 20:19-20)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
See also Mark 14:50-52 and Acts 1:6.
<P>
<I>Mode of the resurrection</I>
<P>
1. Raised by the Father - 1 Peter 1:3; Ephesians 1:19-20; Acts.
2:24
<P>
2. He arose by his own power - John 10:18; John 2:19
<P>
3. He arose by the Holy Spirit - Romans 1:4; 8:11; 1 Pet. 3:18
<P>
<I>Significance</I> 
<P>
Events and things that can only be accounted for by the actual
resurrection of Christ:
<P>
1. Empty tomb. Luke 24:1-9, 12, 22-24; John 20:1-13; Mark 16:1-8
<P>
2. The change in the disciples (see John 20:19-20, Mark 14:50-52,
Acts 1:6)
<P>
3. Change of the day of worship (Romans 14:4-5; Acts 4:33). It
is unlikely that a Jewish person would start worshiping on Sunday,
the first day of the week, unless some excellent rerason demanded
it.
<P>
4. The existence of the NT scriptures.
<P>
5. The existence of the NT church (Cf. what Gamaliel says in Acts):
<BLOCKQUOTE>
But a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law, who was honored
by all the people, stood up in the Sanhedrin and ordered that
the men be put outside for a little while. Then he addressed them:
&quot;Men of Israel, consider carefully what you intend to do
to these men. Some time ago Theudas appeared, claiming to be somebody,
and about four hundred men rallied to him. He was killed, all
his followers were dispersed, and it all came to nothing. After
him, Judas the Galilean appeared in the days of the census and
led a band of people in revolt. He too was killed, and all his
followers were scattered. Therefore, in the present case I advise
you: Leave these men alone! Let them go! For if their purpose
or activity is of human origin, it will fail. But if it is from
God, you will not be able to stop these men; you will only find
yourselves fighting against God.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
His speech persuaded them. They called the apostles in and had
them flogged. Then they ordered them not to speak in the name
of Jesus, and let them go. (Acts 5:34-40)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<B>The significance of the Resurrection</B> 
<P>
1. It declares Christ's deity - Act. 2:24, 27
<P>
2. It distributes resurrection life - Colossians 3:1-4
<P>
3. It distributes resurrection power - Matthew 28:18; Ephesians
1:19-21
<P>
4. It inaugurates Christ's headship - Ephesians 1:18-21
<P>
5. It proclaims justification - Romans 4:25
<P>
6. It recognizes Christ as firstfruits - with the harvest certain
to follow 1 Corinthians 15:2-23
<P>
<B>Ascension</B> 
<P>
There is a view that Jesus ascended immediately after the resurrection,
then descended back to Earth, had his further work on the Earth
showing himself to people for forty days, and then ascended again.
<P>
The typical argument is based on Hebrews 9:6-24 (esp. vs. 12).
On the Day of Atonement (Lev. 16:15), the high priest took the
blood of the sacrifice into the Holy of Holies and sprinkled the
mercy seat. So, according to type, Christ must have presented
his blood in the holy place to the Father.
<P>
A second argument comes with John 20:17:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Jesus said, &quot;Do not hold on to me, for I have not yet returned
to the Father. Go instead to my brothers and tell them, 'I am
returning to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<I>Response:</I> 
<P>
This would mean the work of the cross was unfinished, contradicting
Christ's words, &quot;it is finished&quot; (John 19:30)
<P>
The idea of presenting his blood in heaven supports the Roman
Catholic view of perpetual offering. However, Protestantism generally
doesn't share this concept. In contrast, in the <I>shedding</I>
of blood the redemption is accomplished. There is no saving efficacy
in the blood after it is shed. The eternal achievement is the
blood shed while he was on the cross.
<P>
&quot;Do not hold on to me&quot; in John 20 means &quot;stop clinging
to me&quot;. She grabbed him out of her joy - an entirely normal
human response - but it was not appropriate.
<P>
&quot;For I have not yet returned...&quot; This does not mean
he went to heaven at this moment; instead, he is looking forward
to the ascension recorded in Acts that occured forty days later.
Upon his final ascension, a new intimacy of fellowship would be
possible apart from all material aspects. He was with Mary again,
true, but only temporarily - she should not cling as if he were
never going to leave again, though that was certainly Mary's hope.
<P>
The view of the Ascension after 40 days, or the single Ascension
theory, is the more prevalent and more likely, just from the standpoint
of simplicity. That is, given the option of multiple ascensions
or a single ascension, since the facts are compatible with a single
ascension, that seems the more likely view based on Occam's razor.
<P>
It seems clear from scripture that Jesus anticipated only a single
event, not two, in John 6:62, Luke 9:51, John 7:33, John 14:12-28,
and John 16:4-28.
<P>
The historic record of the ascension seems to describe only a
single event. Consider Luke 24:50-53, Acts 1:6-12 (the account
in Mark 16:19-20 is discounted since Mark 16:9ff are not part
of the original manuscript), Hebrews 4:14, and 1 Peter 3:22.
<P>
<B>Significance of the Ascension</B> 
<P>
What is the significance of the ascension? It was the end of the
period of Jesus' self-limitation He hadn't always displayed his
glory. He now makes it known (Cf. John 17:5; Hebrews 1:3-4, and
Philippians 2:8-11).
<P>
After the ascension, the entrance of resurrected humanity into
heaven was now possible (Hebrews 6:20). Jesus is presented as
the forerunner, the firstfruits (1 Corinthians 15:22. See also
1 Timothy 6:16).
<P>
The ascension begins Jesus' assumption of his new priestly work.
Heb. 7:23-25.
