          <b>Sunday School</b>
        Sunday School meets every Sunday morning at 10:00. In everything that we do at 
        church, we hope to tell people about Jesus' work on the cross so that they can 
        become Christians. Once a person has become a Christian, then the church, in 
        its various activities, helps him or her learn how to live his or her life as a 
        worker for Jesus Christ. Sunday School is an important element in helping give 
        this instruction. Available for every age group from nursery through the oldest 
        adult, the classes are designed to allow plenty of opportunity for asking 
        questions and discussion.<p>
          <b>Worship Services</b>
        The teaching in the evening and Wednesday services are Bible-centered, designed 
        to instruct believers so that they learn how to live as Christians. The Sunday 
        morning services are especially directed to reach those who have not yet become 
        Christians.<p>
          <b>Music</b>
        Included in all worship services, music is provided by piano and other 
        instruments; the music is varied and upbeat, ranging from the newest 
        contemporary songs to the oldest hymns. Occasionally there are solos and other 
        specials.<p>
          <b>Youth</b>
        The youth group meets every Wednesday evening for their own time of Bible Study 
        and prayer. They periodically arrange outings, sleep-overs, and parties (with 
        adult supervision).<p>
          <b>Children</b>
        In addition to the Sunday School program, we have the Kids 4 Christ Club for 
        ages 4-12 on Wednesday nights; it is a time of fun activities that teach about 
        the Bible, helping children discover how to live as Christians. It also 
        provides the opportunity for those who are not yet Christians to make that 
        decision.<p>
          <b>Nursery</b>
        Nursery is provided at all services and is designed to be more than just a 
        baby-sitting service. We hope to provide a foundation, so that when the babies 
        become older they will want to become Christians.
