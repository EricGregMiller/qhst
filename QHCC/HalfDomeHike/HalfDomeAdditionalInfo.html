Lots of good info and pictures. Remember they took the mist trail, so many distances are 1.2mi short.
</p>
<p>
<br>
They also have info on <a href="http://www.thecaliforniahikingpage.com/yosemite/sentinel-dome/sentinel-dome-index.html">Sentinel Dome</a>
and <a href="http://www.thecaliforniahikingpage.com/yosemite/fissures/fissures-index.html">Taft Point</a>.

<a href="http://www.trails.com/tcatalog_trail.asp?trailid=HGS372-012">The Panorama Trail - Glacier Point to Nevada Falls<a>
<p>
Preview: The name of the trail says it all. It follows the southeastern portion of the valley rim above Happy Isles, crossing Illilouette Creek at the top of Illilouette Fall to the (usually) sunny flat where Nevada Fall launches itself over the cliff into Yosemite Valley. The Giant Staircase is in sight most of the way, as well as occasional glimpses of Yosemite Falls back to the west. You get five famous waterfalls in one hike. Take a minute to recover from the overwhelming immensity of the panorama from Glacier Point before setting off.To the left (northwest) is North Dome, capping the graceful Royal Arches; in the center is Half Dome, the monumental symbol of Yosemite.Tenaya Canyon stretches away to the northeast, and to the west runs the Merced River Canyon, down whose Giant Staircase flow Vernal and Nevada Falls. 
</p>
<p>
This site also describes trail as “wet and slippery”. However, others seemed to have no problem.
</p>
<p>
<b>The following sounds bad, but is actually talking about straight down to the valley from Glacier point</b>
<p>
We hiked down from Glacier point. It is a very steep climb, and although only 4 miles, it took about 4 hours, as you can't walk very fast. It was quite tiring on the calf muscles. There wasn't much water, so carry some with you. It was beautiful and the viewpoints across are quite stunning. Quite a bit of the hike was in the shade. It was not always interesing climbing, and it did get a bit tedious at times.

<b>Panorama Trail from Glacier Point</b>
</p>
<img src="GlacierPoint.gif">
<p>
This trail is popular for both day and overnight hikers. Day hikers can hike to the top of Illilouette Falls, along the Panorama Cliffs and down the Vernal/Nevada Falls corridor to Yosemite Valley. Many people do this one way hike by shuttling cars or by paying to take a bus to Glacier Point. This trail is also very popular for overnight hikers wishing to travel to Little Yosemite Valley and Half Dome. Overnight hikers must travel to Little Yosemite Valley before camping. Camping in Little Yosemite Valley is limited to the designated backpacker campground. Overnight camping is not allowed at the bridge above Illilouette Fall, at the top of Nevada Fall or along the Panorama Cliffs.

<b>Note:</b> The distances to Little Yosemite Valley and especially Half Dome seem short. That would make this hike the same distance as from Happy Isles

<a href="http://home.znet.com/schester/fallbrook/hiking/tchikes/yosemite_panorama.html">Glacier Point to Curry Village Via Panorama Trail<a>
<p>
The view from Glacier Point, and indeed from nearly every point along the Panorama Trail, is to die for. Yosemite is a stunning place, one of the crown jewels of America's National Parks, and this trail gives you the best views period of any place in the park. 
</p>
<p>
To get to the trailhead at Glacier Point, we took the shuttlebus for $10.50 each. The bus left Curry Village at 8:05 a.m. and arrived at Glacier Point just before 10:00 a.m. after making four stops in the Valley. (The only other bus left at 1:00 p.m., too late to do this hike.) Although this took much more time than I expected, the trip was absolutely delightful due to the excellent commentary delivered by the driver. He spoke nearly non-stop from his own store of knowledge, and clearly was not delivering a scripted talk about which he knew little. The driver had an excellent knowledge of the history, geology, ecology and biology of the area, and gave many personal observations from living in the Yosemite area and hiking there for many years. I learned a few things, including that the bottom edge of the moss layer on the tree trunks indicates the maximum height of the snowpack
</p>
<p>
This table of distances is cool and informative, but it seems like actual distances walked, including breaks. Perhaps they had a GPS unit??
