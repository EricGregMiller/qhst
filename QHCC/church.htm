          The church is not a building. It's people. The 
          government of Quartz Hill Community Church is vested in the body of believers 
          who compose it. It is subject to no other ecclesiastical body, but it 
          recognizes and sustains obligations of mutual counsel and cooperation which are 
          common among New Testament churches of like faith and order. Quartz Hill 
          Community Church is a cooperating member of the Southern Baptist Convention and 
          the High Desert Baptist Association.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 30pt">
        Quartz Hill Community Church desires to be a dynamic 
        spiritual organism empowered by the Holy Spirit to share Christ with as many 
        people as possible in our church, community, and throughout the world; it seeks 
        to be a worshipping fellowship, experiencing an awareness of God, recognizing 
        his person, and responding in obedience to his leadership; it wants to 
        experience an increasingly meaningful fellowship with God and fellow believers; 
        it wants to help people experience a growing knowledge of God and humanity; it 
        wants to be a church that ministers unselfishly to persons in the community and 
        world in Jesus' name; and it wants to be a church whose purpose is to be 
        Christlike in its daily living, emphasizing total commitment of life, 
        personality, and possessions to the lordship of Christ.
