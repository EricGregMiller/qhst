    <h1>Outreach</h1>
    <p>
      We want to continue reaching out to our community and letting people know who we are.
      Out next day passing out flyers is Saturday, May 24.
      We meet at 9am and have a time of prayer and getting organized.
      Then we drive to neighborshoods, place flyers on doors, and give them to people we meet.
      We finish by noon.
      Please join us in getting the message out.
