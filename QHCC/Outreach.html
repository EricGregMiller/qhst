    <h1>Outreach</h1>
    <p>
      We want to continue reaching out to our community and letting people know who we are.
      On Saturday, December 8, and Saturday, December 15, we will meet at 9am to pass out fliers.
      We will pick one or more nearby neighborhoods and place fliers on doors and give them to people we meet.
      We will finish by noon.
      Please join us in getting the message out.
    </p>
