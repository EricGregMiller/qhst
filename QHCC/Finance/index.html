    <h2>Current Status October 2007</h2>
	<p>
        In October our General Fund balance was always very low.
        We ended the month with $1,234 but have an unpaid property tax bill of $1,106.
        As in September, people responed to the crisis and gave generously to help us stay afloat.
        Our October income was $7,526.
        We were also able to replace our roof. 
        The roof job came in under bid and left us with $1,330 in the roof fund.
        This $1,330 was voted into the General Fund and is part of the $7,526 October general income.
        The temporary balance once again shows only the $75 left over youth money.
