    <h1>December 2006 Report</h1>
      <h3>Overview</h3> 
        <p>
          The increase of our general fund to $4,326 looks like good news, and it is, but not as good as it appears. 
          December was a five Sunday month and all income is reported (there are no outstanding offerings).
          Furthermore, December is usually an up month, followed by down.
          Finally, the December building payment of $1,137 was not made until January (treasurer mistake).
          In light of this, a more accurate balance would be $3,189.
          We basically broke even, which is not such a bad thing.
          All bills are paid and up-to-date.

        <p>
          A refrigerator was bought for the parsonage, which reduces the parsonage fund and the main account balance.
          The temporary fund balance of $139 is due to two things: 
          $224 received for Lottie Moon, but not sent in December; and $85 spent on the youth calendar fund raiser, but none of the funds raised have been deposited yet.
