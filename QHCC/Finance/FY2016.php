  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    This is the 2016 financial report for Quartz Hill Community Church.
    It starts with this overview of the year.
    Following the overview there is detailed information about fund balances and the budget. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Overall 2016 was another good year financially.
		Giving dropped but expenses were also very low.
    Giving to the General Fund dropped to $68,246, about $17,000 below the $85,048 we received in 2015.
		However, expenses fell to $50,370, which is $37,000 below budget.
    Most of the savings was due to not having a full-time pastor, but this also probably was a major factor in the reduced giving.
    The net result is we ended the year with $30,171 in the General Fund, a huge increase over 2015.
  </p>
  <p>
		The renovation project begun in 2014 continued throughout 2016, although at a slightly slower pace than previously.
    Almost all renovation work in 2016 was on remodelling our kitchen or on work related to it.
		The $5,556 that remained in the Renovation Fund was used on the kitchen remodel.
		In addition about $8,800 of maintenenance budget was spent on the remodel and related work.
    The kitchen is done and looks great.
    The Renovation Fund balance stands at $0.
		2017 should see a new maintenance budget more in line with our current needs.
  </p>
  <p>
    A thorough inspection of the parsonage indicated that it was not sensible to spend the money needed to fix it.
    Therefore the congregation voted to sell it as is.
		We received a good price of $180,000.
		After paying the outstanding mortgage and related escrow fees, we netted $129,179 from the sale.
    Combined with the existing $385 leaves the Parsonage Fund with a balance of $129,565.
  </p>
  <p>
		Selling the parsonage erased our largest debt, which was $38,640 at the time of sale.
    In addition we paid off our church building mortgage in August.
		The result is we are now debt free.
  </p>
  <p>
		As usual we continue to reach out to our community and around the world.
		We sent $640 to the Southern Baptist cooperative program.
		As usual the congregation generously participated in the Angel Tree program.
		However, this year we went above and beyond, and spent about $550 on a very nice Christmas party for Angel Tree children.
  </p>
  <p>
		In summary, we are in a good financial position even though giving is down.
		We are in the unusual (for us) position of having some financial stability and flexibility.
		Our financial challenges as we look to 2017 revolve primarily around intelligent use of the funds which God has entrusted to us.

  <h2>Balances</h2>
  <p>
    The table below shows the balances of the various QHCC funds at the end of each month in 2016.
    The chart below the table shows the General Fund history.
    The chart includes unpaid bills in the General Fund balance to show when we are behind.
    All funds are contained in the QHCC Account, which means that the QHCC Account column is a total of the rest.
    Most income and spending occurs through the General Fund.
<!--    When we fall behind in our bills, another bar appears on the chart.
    The "Effective Balance" bars show the General Fund minus any outstanding bills. -->
  </p>
  <p>
    The Parsonage Fund has funds primarily from parsonage refinancing and is used to care for and maintain the parsonage.
    The Deacon Fund is usually donated to every communion service and is used to help people in need.
    At the 2008 budget meeting we voted to set up the Holding Fund.
    It is designed to hold funds needed to pay irregular large bills such as the property tax.
    Periodically youth at the church raise money and this money is stored in the Youth Fund.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Internet and Temporary Funds should normally show zero balances. 
    The Internet Fund tracks Quartz Hill School of Theology's support for our internet fees.
    The Temporary Fund covers money taken in for things not budgeted, such as Souper Bowl or the Lottie Moon offering.
