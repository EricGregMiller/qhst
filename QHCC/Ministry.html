    <h1>Ministry Opportunities</h1>
    There are many opportunities for ministry. 
    Currently we need a Sunday School Superintendent to replace Rick.
    The Sunday School Superintendent job involves ordering material, counting attendance in Sunday School, and coordinating teaching needs for our various classes.
    Please contact <a href="deacons.html">Pastor Don or one of the deacons</a> if you wish to be Sunday School Superintendent or would like some other ministry.
