<h1>Half Dome Hike Information</h1>
<h2>Current Plans</h2>
<p>
Several men of the church plan to hike up Half Dome this July.
Our trip is scheduled for Wedneday, July 11, through Saturday, July 14.
We plan to drive up Wednesday, acclimate Thursday (perhaps taking a small hike), 
hike Half Dome Friday and drive home Saturday.
We will be camping at Bridalveil campsite near Glacier Point.
</p>
<p>
Most people who hike Half Dome start at Happy Isles trailhead in Yosemite valley.
We, however, are planning to start at Glacier Point, end at Happy Isles and take the 
shuttle bus back to our cars at Glacier Point.
The hike from Glacier Point is about 1.4mi longer than from Happy Isles but 
it avoids the 2000 ft. climb from Happy Isles to Little Yosemite Valley. 
</p>
<h2>Interactive Map</h2>
<p>
The map below shows Half Dome and various hiking possibilities. 
It is an interactive map, just like a Google Map (it uses shared Google technology).
Like <a href="maps.google.com">Google maps</a>, you can drag, pan and zoom the map.
You can view a road map, a satellite picture, or both.
In addition, you can view a topographic map (like <a href="http://www.gmap-pedometer.com">Gmaps Pedometer</a>).
Use the radio buttons to show the trail you want to see.
When you move the mouse over the points of interest, they are shown on the map along with relevant information about the points.
You may see some delay in loading the topo maps, the same as on <a href="http://www.gmap-pedometer.com">Gmaps Pedometer</a>.
Clicking on the map shows the latitude and longitude of a point.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately there is a data error for the Half Dome topographic map (Gmaps shows the same error).
If you zoom in more than the original zoom on this page, the Half Dome topo is shifted slightly to the north and west.
The trail routes will be off on these maps. Lesser zooms of the topos, the satellite photos and road maps are all OK.
All but the northern most part of our hike up Half Dome is on this topo.
The <a href="http://www.topozone.com/map.asp?lat=37.73609&lon=-119.55425&s=100&size=l&u=4&datum=nad27&layer=DRG">TopoZone</a> maps appear to be correct.

<h2>Trail Notes</h2>
<h3>John Muir Trail from Happy Isles Trailhead</h3>
<p>
The first route begins and ends at Happy Isles in Yosemite Valley.
We would hike along the JMT until the junction with the Half Dome trail, 
then along the Half Dome trail to the top of Half Dome and return along the same path.
The main advantage of taking this route is that it is the shortest. 
We can even make it shorter by taking the Mist trail part of the way, but that trail is steep and slippery and not usually recommended.
The disadvantage of this path is that it starts 4800ft. below Half Dome, and starts with 2000ft. of 
climbing in the first three miles.
</p>
<h3>Panorama Trail from Glacier Point</h3>
<p>
The second route we are considering begins on the Panorama trail at Glacier Point. 
Much of the hike is the same -- the Panorama trail merges with the JMT after about 4.8mi. (about 3.4mi into the JMT). 
To avoid the climb back up to Glacier Point, we plan to end the hike at Happy Isles and 
take the shuttle bus back to Glacier Point.
The major advantage of the Panorama trail is that we avoid the 2000ft. initial climb of the JMT. 
Another advantage of the Panorama trail is the breathtaking views -- about 4mi of hiking along cliffs that overlook the most breath-taking valley in the world.
A third advantage of the Panorama trail is that we can park our cars at the trailhead and 
not be dependent on the shuttle bus to start our hike.
Although the Panorama trail offers less of a climb and even starts only 1600ft. below Half Dome, 
it still has climbs. 
After leaving Glacier Point, the trail drops to 5800ft. at the Illouette footbridge, 
then climbs back to 6600ft along the Panorama cliff, before dropping to 6000ft at its junction with the JMT.
</p>
<h3>Sentinel Dome and Taft Point Trails.</h3>
<p>
These trails are not part of our Half Dome hike. 
However they do provide short hikes to good vista points.
They might be interesting to hike while we acclimate ourselves.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
Here is the map on topo zone from <a href="http://www.topozone.com/map.asp?lat=37.73609&lon=-119.55425&s=100&size=l&u=4&datum=nad27&layer=DRG">TopoZone</a>.
</p>
<p>
Distances are mostly from <a href="http://www.thecaliforniahikingpage.com/yosemite/halfdome/halfdome.html">California Hiking Pages</a>.
I used the trailhead sign picuture, which I believe refers to the JMT, not the Mist trail.
For any distances in the text I subtracted 1.2mi from points after the Mist trail. 
</p>
<p>
Panorama trail distances are from <a href="http://home.znet.com/schester/fallbrook/hiking/tchikes/yosemite_panorama.html">Glacier Point to Curry Village Via Panorama Trail</a>.
They are merged with the Happy Isles distances by assuming the Panorama trail meets the JMT at Nevada falls.
The <a href="http://home.znet.com/schester/fallbrook/hiking/tchikes/yosemite_panorama.html">Glacier Point to Curry Village Via Panorama Trail</a> distances 
were fudged some zince the table distances seem a little long because of walking around off the trail (using a GPS unit??).
