    <h1>Funding Factory</h1>
    <p>
      The youth are rasing funds by recycling cell phones and ink cartridges.
      They are doing this through the <a href="http://www.fundingfactory.com/programs/recycling/your_help.aspx">Funding Factory</a>.
      Please bring your used cell phones and ink cartridges and leave them in the box in the foyer.
      If your workplace would like to donate that would be even more helpful.
      Contact Beth Houdyshel for more details.
