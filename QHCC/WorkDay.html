    <h1>Work Day</h1>
      Sunday, September 30, we will have a church work day. 
      Come to church dressed in your work clothes.
      We will have a potluck lunch after the second service, then work in the afternoon.
      Stay as long or as little as you wish.
      A list of current needs is posted in the foyer. 
      Feel free to help with these, or any other project you think needs doing.
