        <h2>Background Information</h2>
        <p>
        To encourage himself to get into shape, Don has set a goal to climb <a href="HalfDomeHike/HalfDome.html">Half Dome</a> this summer.
        He is inviting any interested me to join him.
        The Half Dome climb is not easy and those interested should train regularly, 
        especially those of us who were born at a more comfortable distance 
        from the apocalypse and haven't done much physical activity in a while.
        To help encourage regular training we are having practice hikes about once a month. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Here is the practice hike schedule.

        </ul>
        On each hike you should plan on bringing plenty of water and some food. 
        Usually we stop for lunch at the top or halfway point and trail snacks often help keep your energy up.
        Although the main purpose of the practice hikes is to prepare for Half Dome, 
        any man who is interested in a time of hiking and fellowship is invited.
