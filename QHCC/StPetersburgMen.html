    <p>
	We are having a special performance by the St. Petersburg Men's Ensemble.
	They will be at church Thursday, April 26 at 7pm.
	The ensemble sings a mixture of Christian and Russian folk music.
	Don and Karen heard them and were so impressed they invited them to sing at our church.
	Come enjoy the excellent music.
