    <h1>Rummage Sale</h1>
    <p>
      Many call them "garage sales," some call them "yard sales."
      We at church call them "rummage sales."
      To help us get us with our financial woes we are holding a rummage sale.
      It will be February 27th and 28th.
      Please start collecting items you'd like to donate.
      Please also mark each item with a price tag.
      Contact Marla McCulley or Kathy Rose for more details.
