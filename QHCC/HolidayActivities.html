      <p>
        Because of Christmas and the New Year we will not have evening services
        December 24 and December 31.
      </p>
      <p>
        On December 24 the Longs are hosting an open house. Come by and enjoy
        Christmas goodies and fellowship.
      </p>
      <p>
        On December 30 the Millers are having their annual New Years Eve party. 
        The party starts whenever people show up in the evening and runs through midnight.
        Drinks and some snacks will be there, but feel free to contribute as you wish.
        Games, music and good times will usher in the new year.
