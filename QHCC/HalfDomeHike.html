    <h1>Half Dome Hike</h1>
        <a href="HalfDomeHike/HalfDome.html"><img src="HalfDome.jpg" align="left" hspace="20" border="0"></a>
        <h2>Half Dome</h2>
        <p>
        Men from the church hiked up Half Dome in July 2007.
        Information about that hike is <a href="HalfDomeHike2007.html">here</a>.
        We are planning to hike up Half Dome again in July 2008. 
        We are inviting all who wish to come.
        Those who wish can just camp and hang around Yosemite.
        For those climbing Half Dome, we plan to backpack to Little Yosemite the day before the climb.
        Reservations for the backpack are needed by January.
        </p>
        <h2>Practice Hikes</h2>
        <p>
        Currently we are resting from practice hikes.
        We plan to start having practice hikes early in 2008.
        More details will be posted when we have them.
        </p>
        <p>
        Here is the practice hike schedule.
        <ul>
        <li>Saturday, January 12 <a href="HalfDomeHike/BridgeToNowhere.html">Bridge to Nowhere</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        On each hike you should plan on bringing plenty of water and some food.
        Usually we stop for lunch at the top or halfway point and trail snacks often help keep your energy up.
        Although the main purpose of the practice hikes is to prepare for Half Dome, anyone who is interested in a time of hiking and fellowship is invited.
