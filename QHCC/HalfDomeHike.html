    <h1>Half Dome Hike</h1>
        <a href="HalfDomeHike/HalfDome.html"><img src="HalfDome.jpg" align="left" hspace="20" border="0"></a>
        <h2>Half Dome</h2>
        <p>
        Men from the church hiked up Half Dome in July 2007.
        Information about that hike is <a href="HalfDomeHike2007.html">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
        We are planning to hike up <a href="HalfDomeHike/HalfDome.html">Half Dome</a> again in 2008. 
        This year the camp and hike are open to all, not just men.
        We will camp at Bridalveil Campground July 8 through July 12.
        Even if you don't wish to climb Half Dome you can come.
        You can come, go on our short walks, go to Yosemite Valley or just hang around camp as you wish.
        </p>
        <p>
        Trip costs include gasoline, park entry permits, campsite fees and food. 
        The trip will cost about $70 - $75 per person (a break down of estimated costs is <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pzTYwR6Fxe600zb77s17xNg">here</a>).
        The cost may vary especially if gas prices change dramatically.
        Please also plan to bring money for lunch on the drives up and back, shopping in Yosemite Valley and a couple of meals in Yosemite Valley.
        </p>
        <p>

        </ul>        
        </p>
        <h2>Practice Hikes</h2>
        <p>
        Here is the practice hike schedule.
        <ul>
        <li>Saturday, February 2, 8am: <a href="HalfDomeHike/OldRidgeRoute.html">Old Ridge Route</a>.</li>
        <li>Saturday, March 1, 8am: <a href="HalfDomeHike/VasquezRocks.html">Vasquez Rocks</a>.</li>
        <li>Saturday, April 5, 6am: <a href="HalfDomeHike/DevilsPunchbowl.html">Devil's Punchbowl</a>.</li>
        <li>Saturday, May 17, 7am: <a href="HalfDomeHike/BouquetCanyonHikeSouth.html">Bouquet Canyon</a>.</li>
        <li>Saturday, June 7: <a href="HalfDomeHike/BadenPowellHike.html">Mt. Baden-Powell</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        On each hike you should plan on bringing plenty of water and some food.
        Usually we stop for lunch at the top or halfway point and trail snacks often help keep your energy up.
        Although the main purpose of the practice hikes is to prepare for Half Dome, anyone who is interested in a time of hiking and fellowship is invited.
