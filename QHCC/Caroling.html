    <h1>Christmas Caroling</h1>
      This Saturday, December 22, at 6:30pm we will be Christmas caroling in west Lancaster.
      We will also pass out fliers about the church to those interested.
      The caroling will be followed by a time of fellowship, goodies and 
      games at the Spurgeon's.
      Caroling practice is this evening at 6pm at the church.
