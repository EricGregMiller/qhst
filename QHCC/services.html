          <b>Sunday School</b><br/>
        In everything that we do at church, we hope to tell people about Jesus' 
        work on the cross so that they can become Christians. 
        Once a person has become a Christian, then the church, in 
        its various activities, helps him or her learn how to live his or her life as a 
        worker for Jesus Christ. Sunday School is an important element in helping give 
        this instruction. Available for every age group from nursery through the oldest 
        adult, the classes are designed to allow plenty of opportunity for asking 
        questions and discussion.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Worship Service</b><br/>
        The teaching in the Sunday morning service is Bible-centered and designed 
        to instruct believers so that they learn how to live as Christians. 
        Nonetheless anyone is welcome to come and hear. 
        The service often are directed to those who are not familiar with our church.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Small Groups</b><br/>
          Sunday evening small groups meet at church and offer a time for closer fellowship and directed teaching.
          The setting is informal and the teaching style is interactive with a heavy emphasis on group discussion.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Youth</b><br/>
        Youth meet for Sunday School to learn and hang out with friends.
        They periodically arrange outings, sleep-overs, and parties (with
        adult supervision).
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Wednesday Prayer Time</b><br/>
        Wednesday evening services offer a short teaching time but focus primarily on
        prayer.
        Prayer is informal and in small groups.
        There is also plenty of time to visit and fellowship.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Music</b><br/>
        Included in all worship services, music is provided by piano and other 
        instruments; the music is varied and upbeat, ranging from the newest 
        contemporary songs to the oldest hymns. Occasionally there are solos and other 
        specials.
        </p>
        <!--<p>
          <b>Children</b><br/>
        In addition to the Sunday School program, we have the Kids 4 Christ Club for 
        ages 4-12 on Wednesday nights; it is a time of fun activities that teach about 
        the Bible, helping children discover how to live as Christians. It also 
        provides the opportunity for those who are not yet Christians to make that 
        decision.
        </p>-->
        <p>
          <b>Nursery</b><br/>
        Nursery is provided at all services and is designed to be more than just a 
        baby-sitting service. We hope to provide a foundation, so that when the babies 
        become older they will want to become Christians.
