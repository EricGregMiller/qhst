          <b>Sunday School</b><br/>
        In everything that we do at church, we hope to tell people about Jesus' 
        work on the cross so that they can become Christians. 
        Once a person has become a Christian, then the church, in 
        its various activities, helps him or her learn how to live his or her life as a 
        worker for Jesus Christ. Sunday School is an important element in helping give 
        this instruction. Available for every age group from nursery through the oldest 
        adult, the classes are designed to allow plenty of opportunity for asking 
        questions and discussion.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Worship Service</b><br/>
        The teaching in the Sunday morning service is Bible-centered and designed 
        to instruct believers so that they learn how to live as Christians. 
        Nonetheless anyone is welcome to come and hear. 
       
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Bible Study</b><br/>
          Sunday evening Bible Study is a time for closer fellowship and directed teaching.
          The setting is informal and the teaching style is interactive with a heavy emphasis on group discussion.
        </p>
       
        <p>
          <b>Wednesday Dinner & Prayer Time</b><br/>
        Wednesday evening services offer a dinner before the time of prayer begins.
        Prayer is informal and in small groups.
        There is also plenty of time to visit and fellowship.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Music</b><br/>
        Included in the Sunday Morning worship services, music is provided by keyboard and other 
        instruments; the music is varied and upbeat, ranging from the newest 
        contemporary songs to the oldest hymns. Occasionally there are solos and other 
        specials.
        </p>
        <!--<p>
          <b>Children</b><br/>
        In addition to Sunday School we offer a children's church service designed for those under 10.
        </p>-->
        <p>
          <b>Nursery</b><br/>
        Nursery is provided at all services and is designed to be more than just a 
        baby-sitting service. We hope to provide a foundation, so that when the babies 
        become older they will want to become Christians.
