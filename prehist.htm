<B>Creation</B> 
<P>
Genesis raises many questions. The first is very basic: should
we understand Genesis as fact, or fiction? We must settle this
question early on in our discussion, for our views about the nature
of the book will determine how we interpret it.
<P>
If the story of the fall of Adam and Eve into sin is fiction,
perhaps &quot;theological fiction&quot;, as some would call it,
it may be intended to give insight into what is basically wrong
with us as individuals. It may show our frailty, our sin, even
our attitude of rebellion against God. But if it is not historical,
if there is no literal fall, then there was no previous state
of innocence and no guilt for having fallen from it. In other
words, we are not sinful because of our own willful rebellion
against God.
<P>
We are simply sinful.
<P>
We need a helper, perhaps a savior, but we do not need to confess
our sin and repudiate it. Similarly, if the flood is not history,
but only a myth created to teach certain eternal truths, the story
may teach that God does not like sin. But it loses the fearful
truth that God intervenes in history against sin, to judge it,
and so we may begin to question the reality of future, predicted
punishment in the afterlife or at the end of time.
<P>
Is Genesis fact or fiction? Is it to be understood as a record
of literal events? Or is it something like inspired poetry, in
which &quot;spiritual&quot; but not &quot;historical&quot; truths
are discernible?
<P>
There are many who opt for fiction, calling Genesis &quot;myth&quot;
or &quot;fable&quot;. Recently, even some we might otherwise class
as evangelical, not just skeptics, have been willing to take a
similar position.
<P>
However, the rest of Scripture seems intent on assuring us that
Genesis is history.
<P>
This is the point with which Francis Shaeffer begins his short
study of <I>Genesis in Space and Time.</I> His position is that
the mentality of the whole Scripture is that &quot;creation is
as historically real as the history of the Jews and our own present
moment in time. Both the Old and New Testaments deliberately root
themselves back in the early chapters of Genesis, insisting that
they are a record of historical events.&quot;
<P>
As a case in point, Shaeffer cites Psalm 136, which praises God
for his enduring love. The psalm begins with a doxology but then
passes on to the reasons why we should praise him.
<P>
The first of those reasons is his work of creation, as recorded
in Psalm 136:5-9:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
who by his understanding made the heavens, 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
His love endures forever. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
who spread out the earth upon the waters, 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
His love endures forever.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
who made the great lights-- 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
His love endures forever. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
the sun to govern the day, 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
His love endures forever. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
the moon and stars to govern the night; His love endures forever.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Without any break and no indication that he is now beginning to
write a historical rather than in a poetical or somehow less literal
vein, the poet then goes on to list a second reason why God should
be praised: his work of delivering Israel from Egypt. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
to him who struck down the firstborn of Egypt
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
His love endures forever.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
and brought Israel out from among them
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
His love endures forever.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
with a mighty hand and outstretched arm;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
His love endures forever. (Psalm 136:10-12)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
 What is involved here?  Obviously a view of history and of God's
specific acts in history according to which there is natural continuity
between the acts of God in creation and the events of the present
day.  This means that, if we wish to maintain a biblical perspective,
the Genesis account must be taken as history. <BR>
Jesus, too, assumed the historicity of the Genesis account. <BR>
Matthew 19:3-6 records:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Some Pharisees came to him to test him. They asked, &quot;Is it
lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any and every reason?&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
&quot;Haven't you read,&quot; he replied, &quot;that at the beginning
the Creator 'made them male and female,' and said, 'For this reason
a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife,
and the two will become one flesh'? So they are no longer two,
but one. Therefore what God has joined together, let man not separate.&quot;
<P>
Notice also Mark 13:19:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
because those will be days of distress unequaled from the beginning,
when God created the world, until now--and never to be equaled
again.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
None of this will carry that much weight, we must understand,
with those who consider the Genesis account to be mere versions
of those clearly mythical accounts of creation that circulated
in the Ancient Near East before and after the time that Genesis
was written. 
<P>
There are the Babylonian Epic of Creation and the Cosmologies
of Egypt and Phoenicia.  These have some similarities to the accounts
in Genesis. 
<P>
If Genesis is indeed merely one of like character, must we not
think that Jesus was mistaken in his view of creation or at least
(and some have suggested this) he merely adapted his teaching
to the views of his day, though he himself knew better, being
God. 
<P>
The opinion of W.F. Albright is helpful at this point. 
<P>
Albright was not an evangelical, though he became increasingly
conservative in his opinions as his studies progressed (he was
forced into it by the facts) -- yet he spoke openly about the
lack of similarity between Genesis and the other ancient accounts.

<P>
His own view was that Israel was a &quot;rarely endowed people&quot;
who selected &quot;the most vital elements in their religious
literatures,&quot; combined them into &quot;a new and richer synthesis,&quot;
purified them by &quot;the monotheism of Moses, and spiritualized
[them] by the inspired insight of the Prophets.&quot;
<P>
In other words, it was an almost purely human process in his view.

<P>
Yet, in spite of this basic orientation, Albright argued that
it is difficult to see how this early &quot;mythological structure
can be connected in any direct way whatsoever with the biblical
story.&quot; 
<P>
Albright argued that the Babylonian Epic does have a certain superficial
resemblance to the Genesis account.  It was written on seven tablets,
while the Genesis account represents creation as having taken
place over a period of seven days. 
<P>
At some points the language is similar. 
<P>
But beyond that, hardly anything is the same.  The Hebrew account
is monotheistic.  Its language is terse.  The Babylonian account
is polytheistic, verbose, and crassly mythological. 
<P>
At the beginning of the Babylonian account there are two monsters
represented as dragons: 1) Apsu, the freshwater subterranean ocean
and his consort 2) Tiamat, the salt water ocean that surround
the earth. 
<P>
From these two springs a generation of deities, the last of which
become so powerful that Apsu and Tiamat plot to destroy them.

<P>
The result is a titanic struggle in which Tiamat is slain, and
her body is chopped in two.  The upper half is formed into the
heavens, while the lower half becomes the earth. 
<P>
Men and women are then made from the blood of Qingu, Tiamat's
chief minister.
<P>
The text says: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;Punishment they imposed on him, 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
His blood vessels they cut open, 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
with his blood they created mankind.&quot; 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Albright maintains, and I would agree with him, that nearly anyone
can see the vast gulf separating this account from the account
of creation preserved in Genesis. 
<P>
Don't some scholars still argue that the Genesis account is simply
a myth? 
<P>
Yes, some do.  But remember what C.S. Lewis wrote:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
A man who has spent his youth and manhood in the minute study
of the NT texts and of other people's studies of them, whose literary
experiences of those texts lacks any standard of comparison such
as can only grow from a wide and deep and general experience of
literature in general, is, I should think, very likely to miss
the obvious things about them. If he tells me that something in
a gospel is legend or romance, I want to know how many legends
and romances he has read, how well his palate is trained in determining
them by the flavor; not how many years he has spent on that gospel.
(<I>Christianity Today</I>, June 9, 1967, p. 895 &quot;Faulting
the Bible Critics&quot;).
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
 Some may still argue that we are missing the point.  For whether
the language of Genesis is mythical or not, these will still think
it inadequate for giving a truly factual or scientific account
of creation. <BR>
Let us think this through.  The account of creation might have
been written in one of three ways: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
1. In scientific language.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
2. In historical prose.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
3. In poetry. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
What would it take for the account of creation to be written in
scientific language? 
<P>
I quote from Frederick A. Filby, professor of Chemistry and author
of <I>Creation Revealed</I>.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The sciences which probe most deeply into the ultimate facts of
matter and life are probably astro- and modern physics and biochemistry.
But these sciences are written, not so much in language as in
symbols. It takes many pages of symbols to discuss the nature
of a single atom of hydrogen. It has been estimated that to give
a complete account of the position of the group and bonds in a
single virus of molecular weight 300 million would take a 200
page book. If the scientific description of a single hydrogen
atom, or of a virus too small to be seen without a microscope,
takes a book, what hope is there of ever giving a scientific account
of the creation of man and the universe?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Yet Genesis 1...uses only 76 different root words. If Genesis
1 were written in absolute scientific language to give an account
of creation, there is no man alive, nor ever has there been, who
could understand it. If it were written in any kind of scientific
language, only the favored few could understand it. It would have
to be rewritten every generation to conform to the new views and
terms of science. It could not be written in our mid-twentieth
century scientific language, for no earlier generations could
have grasped its meaning, and to our children it would be out
of date. The scientific description of the 'how' of the universe
is beyond the understanding of any human brain, but Genesis 1
was written for <I>all </I>readers, not for <I>none</I>....
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
What then would be the best method for the Creator to use for
(1) making a beginning to his book and (2) establishing that the
God of the Bible is also the God of creation -- in language simple
enough for all men in all time?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;The answer is...Genesis 1...the most amazing composition
in all the world's literature, using only 76 different word forms
fundamental to all mankind, arranged in a wonderful poetical pattern,
yet free from any highly colored figures of speech.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
It provides the perfect opening to God's book and establishes
all that men really need to know of the <I>facts</I> of creation.
No man could have invented it: it is as great a marvel as a planet
or a bird. It is God's handiwork, sufficient for Hebrew children
or Greek thinkers, or Latin Christians; for medieval knights or
modern scientists or little children; for cottage dwellers or
cattle ranchers or deep sea fishermen; for Laplanders or Ethiopians,
East or West, rich or poor, old or young, simple or learned...sufficient
for all! Only God could write such a chapter...and he did!
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
 The most fundamental of all issues is whether or not God has
spoken to us in scripture.  If you answer no, then you should
go away and forget all this. 
<P>
Yes, and then you can stay.
<P>
<B>The Most Popular Views of Creation</B>
<P>
<B>IV. Summary of the Most Common Interpretations of the Creation
Narrative:</B> 
<P>
<I>1. Six Day Creationism</I>
<P>
Takes the approach that the six days of Genesis 1 are to be understood
as actual twenty-four hour days.  Holds to a basically chronological
approach to the creation narrative, and believes that the universe
as a whole came into being about six thousand years ago.  Believes
that all the fossils were formed at the time of the Great Flood
of Noah.
<P>
<I>2. Gap Theory Creationism </I>
<P>
Places a gap in the narrative either before Genesis 1:1 or between
Genesis 1:1 and 1:2; believes the universe was created approximately
twenty billion years ago, then suffered a cataclysmic destruction
at the time of Satan's rebellion, necessitating he reconstruction
of the Earth about six thousand years ago.  The fossil records
illustrate the life forms prior to the reconstruction recorded
from Genesis 1:2 and following.  In common with the Creationist
perspective, it holds that the six days are to be understood as
ordinary twenty-four hour days. 
<P>
<I>3. Progressive Creationism </I>
<P>
Believes that the six days of Genesis should be understood as
long periods of time, rather than twenty-four hour days.  Believes
that God brought the universe into existence about twenty billion
years ago.  Believes that God created the world directly and deliberately,
that is, without leaving anything to chance, but that he did it
over long periods of time that correspond roughly to geologic
ages.  Different items were created on each successive day, with
long periods of waiting before the next stage of creation took
place.  Would suggest that creation is still going on.  Does not
necessarily view the creation narrative as a chronological description
of events. 
<P>
<I>4. Theistic Evolutionary Creationism </I>
<P>
Believes that the six days of Genesis should be understood as
long periods of time, rather than twenty-four hour days.  Believes
that God brought the universe into existence about twenty billion
years ago, and then made use of the evolutionary process to bring
forth life over an extended period.  Does not necessarily view
the creation narrative as a chronological description of events.
<P>
<B>Thematic Arrangement of the Six Days</B>
<P>
1. Light=day/dark=night   4. Sun for day/moon, stars for night
<BR>
2. water below/above   5. fish below/birds above <BR>
3. dry ground, plants   6. land animals, people 
<P>
Notice that on days 1-3, empty places are made, while on days
4-6 the inhabitants to fill those empty places are made.
<P>
<B>Topical Expansion in Hebrew Poetry and Narrative</B> 
<P>
Not uncommonly in the Old Testament, you'll find the structure
of the text is similar to what you'd find in a newspaper article,
where the first line or paragraph summarizes the rest of the story.
 Look at the following examples to get a sense of how this works
in the Bible. <BR>

<P>
<B>1. Genesis 1:1-3:25 </B>
<P>
1:1  In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
1:2-2:4a  How God created the heavens and the earth.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
2:4b-3:25  How God created man and woman. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<B>2. Jonah 3:5-9 </B>
<P>
3:5  Summary of the response of the city to Jonah's preaching.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
3:6-9  Specific details of what happened and how.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
3. Proverbs 1:10-19
<P>
1:10 My son, if sinners entice you 
<P>
        do not go.  
<BLOCKQUOTE>
1:11-14  How sinners entice. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
1:15-19  Do not go with them.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
4. Ecclesiastes 2:1-26 
<P>
2:1  I spoke in my heart, &quot;Come now, I will test pleasure

<P>
       and examine good.&quot; 
<P>
       Behold: all of it is also meaningless. 
<P>
2:2-10  Testing with pleasure to discover what's good. 
<P>
2:11-26  Everything is meaningless.
<P>
1. Arguments in favor of Six Day Creationism 
<P>
1. Linguistic 
<P>
There seems to be a problem with taking the days of Genesis to
mean anything other than normal twenty-four hour days.  The only
time that it can be demonstrated that &quot;day&quot; in Hebrew
means more than twenty-four hours is when it is placed in a genitival
relationship with another noun, as in Psalm 90:4 and Genesis 2:4,
i.e., &quot;day of...&quot;
<P>
2. All three other theories (Gap, Progressive, Theistic) introduce
death and destruction into the world before the entrance of sin.

<P>
&quot;If death was the punishment for sin, as the Bible seems
to indicate, and if this punishment was imposed upon the whole
world (including the animals) as the result of Adam's sin, then
there could not have been death in the world before Adam, and
the fossil record must be post-Adamic, as the Flood geologists
state.  Morris puts it tersely: <BR>
'The day-age theory...accepts as real the existence of death before
sin, in direct contradiction to the Biblical teaching that death
is a divine judgment on man's dominion because of man's sin (Rom.
5:12).  Thus it assumes that suffering and death comprise integral
parts of God's work of creating and preparing the world for man,
and this in effect pictures God as a sadistic ogre...not as the
Biblical God of grace and love.&quot;
<P>
2. Arguments in favor of Gap Theory Creationism (and problems
with other positions) 
<P>
Would argue that six day creationists ignore reality; the universe
is clearly older than six thousand years.
<P>
The usage of Tohu and Bohu 
<P>
The usage of <I>hayah</I>, &quot;to be&quot; or &quot;to become&quot;.
<P>
3. Arguments in favor of Theistic Evolutionary Creationism or
Progressive Creationism (and problems with other positions) 
<P>
The structure of Genesis 1-2 is not chronological: 
<P>
I. Summary statement, Genesis 1:1-2 
<P>
A. General Details of Creation, 1:2-2:3 
<P>
a. The Six Days  
<BLOCKQUOTE>
1. light/darkness        4. sun/moon and stars 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
2. water above/below     5. birds/fish 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
3. dry land, vegetation  6. animals and people
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
b. God Rests (seventh day)  
<P>
B. Details of Human Creation (return to the sixth day) 
<P>
(Genesis. 2:4-25) 
<P>
The structure of the six days narrative follows the pattern of
the creation of empty spaces (light and dark, water and atmosphere,
land) which are then filled by specific objects.  Notice, too,
that the first two days (and the parallel fourth and fifth day)
are split into two segments, while the third day and parallel
sixth day are not so split, with plants rising from the soil on
the third day and animals rising from the soil to inhabit the
land and consume the vegetation on the sixth day.
<P>
The word &quot;day&quot; is defined in the context of the creation
narrative in 1:5 where it is equated with the word &quot;light&quot;,
not a twenty-four hour period. 
<P>
The phrase, &quot;And there was evening, and there was morning
-- the...day&quot; occurs only in the first chapter of Genesis.
 It's exact meaning therefore is not absolutely clear.  Certainly
creationists are unwarranted in pressing the phrase as &quot;proof&quot;
of their contention that these are twenty-four hour days.  The
phrase itself proves nothing. 
<P>
There are other time periods in the Bible that are not literal
in their meaning -- for instance the seventy weeks of Daniel chapter
nine, which refer to a time period of 483 YEARS.  As if this were
not enough, according to the most popular evangelical teaching,
the last week is separated from the preceding sixty-nine weeks
by an indefinite time that at present has stretched to almost
2000 years, though there is nothing in the text of Daniel 9 to
suggest this possibility (hardly resulting in the most obvious
or &quot;literal&quot; interpretation of these seventy &quot;weeks&quot;).

<P>
Adam can be accepted as literally real even within an evolutionary
framework. 
<P>
As Abraham was later to be chosen by God from a pagan, polytheistic
society in order to become the progenitor of his chosen people,
so God can be seen as selecting Adam from a pre-existing group
of hominids and then giving them the choice of serving God or
not.  Perhaps Adam was a radical mutation from his forbearers,
hence the story in Genesis 2 describing his difficulty in finding
a suitable mate, necessitating divine intervention to fashion
a female clone (notice she was constructed from his genetic material).
<P>
The search for a mate and the naming of the animals is also evidence
that the sixth day at least, was almost certainly not a twenty-four
hour period, since it would be difficult if not impossible, for
a single man, however gifted, to identify and name all the species
on the planet in so limited an amount of time.  Consider that
there are at least one million species of animals (using the number
Morris gives in his book <I>The Genesis Flood</I>).  Therefore,
allowing no time for sleep, Adam would have had to name eleven
and a half animals every second (with 86,400 seconds in 24 hours).
 And this doesn't leave him time to realize there is no mate fit
for him, or for God to put him to sleep and form Eve. 
<P>
Jesus said he would return &quot;quickly&quot; or &quot;soon&quot;
(see Rev. 22:12, 20); yet if the world is really only 6000 years
old, to have waited for nearly 2000 years hardly seems &quot;soon&quot;.
 However, if the world is actually 4.6 billion years old (and
the universe 15-20 billion), then 2000 years is hardly any time
at all (cf. the analogy made between a day and the history of
the universe, where all of recorded human history takes up only
the last few seconds). 
<P>
The genealogies of Genesis are not likely to be complete and therefore
do not function as a chronology.  The genealogies of Genesis 5
and 11:10-26 are both lists of ten names, and both end with the
final individual have three significant sons.  The artificial
and selective nature of these genealogies thereby becomes apparent.
<P>
Matthew divides the genealogy of Jesus into three sections, each
with fourteen names.  His reason for doing this is that the Hebrew
name David is written with three letters whose numerical value
is fourteen.  To get the structure he desires, Matthew left out
several names, which can be demonstrated by comparing his genealogy
with those given in the Old Testament (for instance Matthew 1:8
and 1 Chronicles 3:10-12).  Therefore, it seems reasonable to
suspect that the author of Genesis does a similar thing with his
genealogies in order to get his ten plus three pattern. 
<P>
1 Chronicles 16:14-17 (which parallels Psalm 105:7-10; also cf.
Deuteronomy 7:9) states the following:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
He is Yahweh our God;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
his judgments are in all the earth.He remembers his covenant forever,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
the word he commanded, for a thousand generations,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
the covenant he made with Abraham,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
the oath he swore to Isaac.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
He confirmed it to Jacob as a decree,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
to Israel as an everlasting covenant:...
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
These passages seem to suggest that far more than the twenty generations
listed in Genesis 5 and 11 existed between the time of Adam and
the time of Abraham.  Though it is possible to read &quot;thousand
generations&quot; in parallel with &quot;forever&quot; in vs.
15, thereby making &quot;thousand generations&quot; figurative
hyperbole, one could just as easily argue that &quot;thousand
generations&quot; defines &quot;forever,&quot; moving from general
to specific (as in the numerical Proverbs [Proverbs 30:15-16,
30:18-19, 30:24-28, 30:29-31).  However, even if &quot;thousand
generations&quot; is hyperbolic it still suggests that far more
than a mere twenty generations are in view. 
<P>
Romans 5:12 is sometimes quoted to show that death could not have
existed on Earth until Adam's fall.  However, it should be pointed
out that the passage in Romans is speaking only about human death
and that it would be difficult to press it to include the death
of any other life forms.  Moreover, before the fall it is clear
(from Genesis 1:29-30) that at least plants had to die in order
to serve as food for people and animals.   This is  impossible
to reconcile if the passage in Romans is pressed to include any
more than human beings.
<P>
Creationists also contend that to allow death, suffering and the
struggle for survival before Adam's sin is to make God into an
ogre, since God repeatedly describes his creation as &quot;very
good&quot; in Genesis 1. 
<P>
However, in Psalm 136:17-20, where the death of the first born
in Egypt and the deaths of Sihon and Og are described, the Psalmist
comments that God's &quot;love endures forever.&quot;  Psalm 116:15
states that &quot;Blessed in the sight of God is the death of
his saints.&quot;  In both  these passages we are discussing the
deaths of human beings, not lower life forms! <BR>
Genesis 3:22-23 records that Adam and Eve were expelled from the
garden in order to prevent them from eating the fruit of the Tree
of Life and thereby living forever. 
<P>
Why? 
<P>
Because death was absolutely necessary if human redemption was
ever to occur.  If human beings were not to wind up in the hopeless
condition of the demons and Satan, they had to be able to die.
 Only by the Son of God taking upon himself the form of a human
being and dying could the race be saved.  If Jesus had not been
able to die, then the human race would have remained in its sin
and been forever irredeemable.  (The reason Satan and the demons
cannot repent and be saved is simply because Jesus cannot die
for their sins; Satan and the demons are immortal: they cannot
die.) <BR>
Death can also be seen as a good thing from the standpoint that
it limits the damage that the wicked can do.  Sooner or later,
even a monster like Hitler has to die -- thereby putting an end
to his evil. 
<P>
It can be demonstrated that death is necessary in order for life
to exist at all (animals eat plants, while other organisms consume
the dead plants and dead animals, returning nutrients to the soil,
making it fertile for the growth of new plants).  A question should
also be asked: if animals didn't die before Adam's fall, then
why do they die after it?  Did they sin, too?  Why should Adam's
sin have an  effect on them.

<B>V. The Image of God</B>

Where does the Bible tell us that this is what is meant by the
&quot;image of God&quot;?  Nowhere.
<P>
What does the Bible tell us about the nature of &quot;image&quot;?
 Look at Genesis 5:1-3.
<P>
Apparently, there is no great mystery, though a remarkable number
of Christians are uncomfortable with the implications.  The plain
meaning is that human beings look like God. 
<P>
God has shown himself occasionally: Genesis 18, Exodus 24; cf.
John 1:18.
<P>
<B>THE FALL OF THE HUMAN RACE</B> 
<P>
The third chapter of Genesis, which portrays the temptation and
the fall of man, has him living blissfully and innocently in a
delightful environment.  This fall is of immense theological importance.
 It furnishes the basis and supplies the need for divine redemptive
activity on behalf of the human race.
<P>
<B>1. Location of the Garden of Eden:</B> 
<P>
Biblical notices locate the garden of Eden, where the temptation
and fall occurred, somewhere in the Tigris-Euphrates country,
apparently.  See Genesis 2:10-14. 
<P>
It is futile to try to determine the exact site now.  The effects
of the flood, shifting river beds, and the changing configuration
of the country in the course of millenniums had lead many to believe
that such a task is impossible. <BR>
However, we must remember that the author of this passage is Moses,
and he is writing for a specific audience; therefore he uses terms
and place names that that audience will understand.  For instance,
although the patriarchs were unaware of the name &quot;Yahweh&quot;
according to Exodus 3 and 6, because it had not been revealed
until God told it to Moses, we find the name used throughout the
book of Genesis on the lips of the patriarchs.  Why?  Because
it was important for the Israelites that they should identify
the God of their fathers Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, as being identical
to the God Yahweh who was now leading them from bondage to the
promised land. 
<P>
Likewise, the terms for these rivers and the locations of them
perhaps apply to then existing rivers, not the names actually
used in antiquity. 
<P>
Tigris and Euphrates are easily identified.  What about the Pishon
and....? 
<P>
There are possibilities:
<P>
<B>2. The Myth of Adapa:</B> 
<P>
There is an ancient legend, which has been commonly interpreted
as the Babylonian parallel to the fall of man in Genesis 3.  It
was discovered on four cuneiform fragments, three from King Ashurbanipal's
library in Nineveh (seventh century BC) and the fourth from the
archives of the Egyptian kings Amenhotep III and IV at Amarna
(first half of the fourteenth century BC).  It is a story, like
the Epic of Gilgamesh (which we will get to when we study the
Flood), of a man's failure to seize the opportunity of gaining
eternal life. 
<P>
Adapa was a man to whom the god Ea had given wisdom, but not eternal
life.  As the administrator of Ea's temple at Eridu, he was out
on the Persian gulf fishing when the south wind rose suddenly
and upset his boat, plunging him into the sea.  Enraged, he broke
&quot;the wing of the south wind&quot;, pictured apparently as
some sort of bird.  Thus crippled, the south wind was unable to
blow cooling breezes over the land.
<P>
For this violent deed Adapa is called to answer before Anu, the
Great God of Heaven. Before ascending to the ethereal regions,
Ea, his father, instructs Adapa to dress in mourning as a token
of reverence to the two gatekeepers who have recently left the
land of the living and not to eat the food of death or drink the
water of death which will be offered him. His mourning for the
gatekeepers secures their goodwill. They intercede for him so
successfully that, instead of punishing him, Anu decides to bless
him:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;...The food of life
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Bring him that he may eat.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The food of life
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
They brought him,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
but he did not eat.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The water of life
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
They brought him,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
but he did not drink.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
A garment they brought him, 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
And he clothed himself.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Oil they brought him, 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
And he anointed himself
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Anu looked at him and laughed at him.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;Come here, Adapa! 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Why have you not eaten or drunk?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Now you will not live! 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Woe [to]...mankind.&quot; 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Ea, my lord, said: 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;Do not eat,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
do not drink!&quot; 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;Take him and bring him back to his earth&quot; [said Anu].

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Having been sent back to earth to die like all other people, Adapa
forfeited the chance at gaining eternal life.  It is clear from
Fragment IV of the text, that he is a representative of the human
race.  His refusal to partake of the bread and water of life not
only lost HIM eternal life, but also involved the whole race in
illness and disease, and evidently also lost immortality for the
human race as well.
<P>
<B>3. The Myth of Adapa and Genesis 3</B> 
<P>
Whatever correspondences there are between the myth of Adapa and
the third chapter of Genesis, the Babylonian legend obviously
does not offer a clear parallel to the biblical account of the
fall of the human race, and scholars are unwarranted in making
such an application (which doesn't prevent a few from trying).

<P>
There is not the slightest reason to look for the fall in the
literature of the Babylonians, as the idea of a fall is contrary
to their whole system of polytheistic speculation.  In Genesis
man is created in the image of a holy God.  But the Babylonians,
like the Greeks and Romans after them, created their gods, good
and bad, in the image of men.  Such gods who schemed, hated, fought
and killed one another could not be expected to create that which
was morally perfect.  Neither could a person who was formed out
of the blood of such deities possess anything but an evil nature.
 No fall was possible, because people were created evil, and had
no state of innocence from which to fall.  No Babylonian god ever
looked at what he had made and called it &quot;very good&quot;.

<P>
However, it cannot be denied that some elements in the legend
of Adapa are striking by way of similarity or contrast.  The &quot;food
of life&quot;, corresponds to the &quot;fruit&quot; of &quot;the
tree of life&quot; (Gen. 3:3, 22).  The two accounts accordingly
agree in the thought that eternal life could be obtained by eating
a certain kind of food or fruit.  However, Adam forfeited immortality
for himself because of sin, because he wished to be &quot;like
God&quot; (Gen 3:5).  For this reason he was expelled from the
garden lest he should eat of the &quot;tree of life...and live
forever&quot; (Gen. 3:22).  Had Adam not been prevented from eating,
and had he become immortal, he would have sabotaged any possibility
for redemption, because for redemption to occur the Son of God
would have to become a man and die.  If men could not die, then
Jesus could not die, and therefore sin could not be atoned for.
 People would have been just like the demons, then. 
<P>
Adapa was already endowed with wisdom by the gods and failed to
become immortal, not on account of disobedience or presumption
like Adam, but because of his obedience to his creator, EA, who
deceived him. 
<P>
Like the Biblical narrative of the fall of our race, the Adapa
story deals with the perplexing question of why people must suffer
and die.  In contrast, however, the answer is not that people
fell from their moral integrity and that sin into which they fell
involved death, but that this man lost his chance to obtain eternal
life as a result of being deceived by one of the gods.  The origin
of human sin is not at all in view in the Adapa story, while this
is basic to the Genesis account.
<P>
<B>The Beginning of Civilization</B> 
<P>
The Bible connects the beginning of human civilization with Cain
and Able, the two sons of Adam.  There are, as yet, no ancient
texts from Mesopotamia which bear any resemblance to the story
of Cain and Abel.
<P>
<I>1. The beginnings of agricultural life</I> 
<P>
People, as they very early had to become a food producer (after
the fall they were driven from the garden and had to work hard
for their food, unlike the ideal conditions in the garden of Eden),
began to control nature by simple farming and animal raising.
 Both of these activities are closely related, and begin at approximately
the same time, according to Genesis 4:2, where we find the first
two offspring of the first two human beings, involved in these
two activities: Abel kept sheep and Cain was a dirt farmer.
<P>
<I>2. The beginnings of urban life</I> 
<P>
The line of Cain is connected with the establishment of the earliest
city and with the development of the arts and crafts of urban
life (Gen. 4:16-24).  Jabal is connected with the development
of pastoral and bedouin life (Gen. 4:20).  His brother, Jubal,
is associated with the art of music and the invention of the first
musical instruments -- the harp and the pipe (Gen. 4:21).  Tubal-Cain
is mentioned in connection with the science of metallurgy and
craftsmanship in bronze and iron (Gen. 4:22). 
<P>
One thing to keep in mind is that we do not have the remains of
any preflood civilizations.  All the sites excavated simply tell
us what things were like after the flood.  For instance, the earliest
village settlements yet discovered are in northern Mesopotamia
at Tell Hassuna, south of modern Mosul and at Nineveh and at Tepe
Gawra, &quot;The Great Mound&quot; northwest of Nineveh.  These
sites belong to the Neolithic period, and are dated to about 5000
BC or earlier, and show stone tools and weapons, pottery and rude
buildings. 
<P>
Around 4500 BC copper came into use alongside of stone and by
3000 BC had displaced it as the dominant material for making tools
and weapons.  Iron came into general use not until 1200 BC.  But
in Gen. 4:22 we are confronted with bronze (a mixture of copper
and tin) and iron in use simultaneously, long before 1200 BC.
<BR>
What the sites so far discovered, therefore, show, is the re-invention
and re-development of a lost civilization and technology. 
<P>
Something to keep in mind: we do not know what things were like
before the flood in any detail.  We know that there were at least
(if we ignore the likely gaps in the genealogies) 1600 years between
the creation and the time of the flood.  We know that the people
before the flood were living upwards of nine hundred years or
more.  When you consider the technological advancement in just
the last two hundred years, advancement made possible by people
who live upwards of seventy years, we must not be quick to assume
that life before the flood was a primitive, stone age situation.
 Their world could have been just as advanced -- perhaps even
more advanced -- than our own.  We do not know.  But the word
which was before the flood, was completely destroyed (2 Peter
3:6). 
<P>
If you think it strange that it has taken so long to rediscover
technology, keep in mind the difficulty you would have if the
whole world was destroyed and you alone were left to rebuild it
from scratch.  A nuclear holocaust is nothing compared to what
the flood did to this planet.
