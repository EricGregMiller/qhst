<B>Book of Ecclesiastes</B> 
<P>
<B>I. Title:</B> 
<P>
The title of the book comes from the the Septuagint, the Greek
translation of the Hebrew Old Testament. The word &quot;Ecclesiastes&quot;
is an attempt to translate the Hebrew <I>Qohelet</I> on the analogy
of the rendering of <I>qahal</I>, &quot;congregation&quot;, by
the Greek word <I>ekklesia</I>, &quot;assembly, church.&quot;
The <I>ekklesiastes</I> is then understood as the leader or speaker
of an assembly.
<P>
<B>II. Author:</B> 
<P>
<I>A. Arguments Against Solomonic Authorship:</I> 
<P>
1. The words &quot;I the preacher was king over Israel&quot; (1:12),
seeming to indicate that his reign was in the past, could not
have been written by Solomon, who never ceased to be king as long
as he was alive.
<P>
2. It seems odd that a book purportedly coming from the son of
David should omit the divine name Yahweh which appears commonly
in the books of Psalms and Proverbs. It also seems odd that there
should be no mention of the history of Israel, Solomon's work
in building the Temple, or his palaces and gardens.
<P>
3. If written during Solomon's old age it seems puzzling that
he merely sighs over the emptiness of life instead of repenting
of his apostacy.
<P>
4. As merely the second king of his dynasty, it seems odd that
he should speak of &quot;all that had been before him&quot; as
if there had been a bunch.
<P>
5. The book describes the disorder and corruption of the government
(4:1, 5:8, 8:9, 10:5). This seems unexpected, since if such evils
existed, then Solomon was responsible for them.
<P>
6. The book seems to present striking parallels with the language
of Malachi, which is generally dated to a time after the Babylonian
Captivity, perhaps as late as 390 BC.
<P>
7. The book seems to contain allusions to events in the history
of Persia. Some think it may even refer to the history of Egypt
under the Ptolomies (4:13, 5:8, 9:14, 10:7, 16, 17, 20)
<P>
8. Some scholars see the germs of three tendencies which later
developed in Judaism: Pharisaism, Sadducaism, and the asceticism
of the Essenes (3:19-21, 7:1-6, 16).
<P>
9. Several passages seem to betray a writer influenced by Greek
philosophy and literature ( 1:3-11, 2:24, 3:20, 5:18, 6:6, 12:11-12).
<P>
<I>B. Arguments In Favor of Solomonic Authorship</I> 
<P>
1. The book identifies itself as having been written by Solomon.
&quot;I am a teacher, I was king over Israel in Jerusalem.&quot;
(1:12). Only David, Solomon, and for a very short time, Rehoboam
would have been able to make such a statement, that he was king
over Israel, in Jerusalem. After Jeroboam's rebellion, the king
in Jerusalem was only the king of Judah. Israel had its own kings.
<P>
2. Hebrew does not have past, present or future tenses, only completed
or uncompleted aspects. It would not necessarily be inappropriate
to use completed aspect &quot;I was&quot;.
<P>
3. The nature of the book and the perspective from which the author
is writing would make the use of the divine name inappropriate,
since he is seeking to discover knowledge of God appart from his
revelation to the nation of Israel. Hense also, the lack of mention
of the temple, Moses, or Israel's history.
<P>
4. Likewise, the fact he is not repenting for apostacy is because
he is still aposticised, unable to find God or know what God wants,
since he has purposely turned his back on divine revelation (see
1:13-14)
<P>
5. The similarities to Greek philosophy and literature are more
simply explained by a general similarity in topics than any conscious
borrowing. The differences in perspective between Ecclesiastes
and Greek thought are far more profound and obvious than the supposed
points of confluence.
<P>
6. Certainly it is to be expected that the Pharisees, Saducees
and Essenes would have been influenced by Ecclesiastes; but they
were also influenced by the rest of the Old Testament. We are
dealing with Jewish people, after all. Such influence is no proof
of a late, non-Solomonic authorship.
<P>
7. Supposed historical allusions are weak evidence at best, since
they rely on the assumption that the book is late and are never
explicit. Other possibilities are available.
<P>
8. The language used by Ecclesiastes is not the best evidence
for late authorship since the Masoretes have obscured whatever
historical development might have at one time existed in the Hebrew
of the Bible. They regularized and standardized usage, so that
few differences exist between so-called &quot;early&quot; and
&quot;late&quot; books.
<P>
9. David had no problem repenting of his role with Bathsheba,
and modern politicians are often quite forward in admitting errors
of judgement in their memoirs. Why should it surprise us to find
Solomon able to admit that his administration is not doing well
-- especially considering the depressive nature of the book. Depressed
people will tend to exagerate the bad at the espense of the good.
His discouragement at conditions are consistent with the tenor
of the book as a whole.
