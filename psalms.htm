<B>The Writings</B> 
<P>
The last segment of the Hebrew Bible was called the writings;
unlike the earlier two sections, the third and final section seems
to be a catch-all of miscellaneous documents, as if the compiler
of the Bible decided on having a section called &quot;miscellaneous&quot;.
<P>
Some scholars have tried to argue that the contents of the writings
are necessarily later in composition than the works that make
up the Law and the Prophets, and to some extent this may be true.
Certainly the books of Chronicles and Ezra-Nehemiah are post-exilic
in their origin. However, while the final form of such books as
Psalms and Proverbs were probably post- exilic, they contain material
which dates to a much earlier time. And the same can be said for
Job, Ruth, and Ecclesiastes. Daniel is of course exilic, and although
the majority of scholars would argue for a post-exilic date, this
Outline will assume an exilic date for the book.

<B>Hebrew Poetry</B> 
<ADDRESS>
A. Introduction
</ADDRESS>

<P>
Although most of the Latter Prophets are written in poetry, it
was decided to wait until this point in the Outline to discuss
the nature of Hebrew poetry, since traditionally it is with the
book of Psalms that discussions of poetry generally begin.
<P>
However, the earliest examples of Hebrew poetry may be found in
Exodus 15, the so-called Song of the Sea, and in Judges 5, the
Song of Deborah.
<ADDRESS>
B. The Nature of Hebrew Poetry
</ADDRESS>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
1. Lacks Everything
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Ordinarily, when a person who speaks English thinks of poetry,
the word that most readily comes to mind is &quot;rhyme&quot;.
The clearest distinguishing characteristic between poetry and
prose in English is this single concept. Prose is the nature of
this and all the previous sentences; nothing rhymes, except by
accident. A secondary characteristic of poetry in English is that
it has rhythm. Today, the most common poetry that people here
is in music, which combines all aspects of English poetry in a
pleasant format.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;Roses are blue,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Violets are red,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
If you think it's true
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
You're touched in the head.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Hebrew poetry, in contrast to the poetry in English, lacks all
these distinguishing characteristics. It rarely, if ever, has
rhythm, and rhyme exists only by accident.
<P>
So how does Hebrew poetry differ from Hebrew prose?
<P>
Through what is technically called, parallelism. It is responsible
for the somewhat repetitious quality most readers of the Psalms
(and other poetry in the Bible) have no doubt noticed.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
2. Parallelism
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
What is parallelism? Perhaps the easiest way to describe it would
be to say that whereas in English, poems rhyme <I>sounds</I>,
in Hebrew, poems rhyme <I>ideas</I>.
<P>
For instance, take a look at Psalm 1:1:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;Blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the
wicked,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
or stand in the way of sinners
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
or sit in the seat of mockers.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Rather than seeing here three separate behaviors or individuals,
the nature of Hebrew poetry instead shows us a single individual
and a single idea, but viewed, as it were, stereoscopically. &quot;Counsel
of the wicked&quot;, &quot;way of sinners&quot; and &quot;seat
of mockers&quot; are all parallel or synonymous concepts.
<P>
Look at 1:2:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;But his delight is in the law of Yahweh
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
and on his law he meditates day and night.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Again, the &quot;delighting&quot; and the &quot;meditating day
and night&quot; are synonymous concepts.
<P>
Look at Psalm 3:1:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;O Lord, how many are my foes!
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
How many rise up against me!&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The &quot;foes&quot; and those who &quot;rise up&quot; are the
same people, the concept simply being expressed in more than one
way. In English, where a writer might pile up adjectives, or use
long description, the Hebrew author would simply give parallel
statements. Therefore, if we were to translate Psalm 1:1 form
poetry into English prose, the concept that the psalmist would
be intending would come across something like: &quot;Blessed is
the man who does not practice wickedness as a life pattern.&quot;
Perhaps not as beautiful or memorable as the psalmist's words,
but the thought remains the same.
<P>
As an exercise, the reader might examine Judges 4 and 5 and notice
the difference in the method of expression used to describe the
same incident. Judges 4 recounts in prose Deborah's victory against
the enemies of Israel, while Judges 5 recounts the same incidents,
only in poetry.
<ADDRESS>
C. Types of Parallelism
</ADDRESS>

<P>
The writers made use of parallelistic principles in a number of
different ways. Three of the most common sorts that the reader
will come across are listed below:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
1. Synonymous
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The most common, and &quot;standard&quot; form of parallelism,
characterized by the two or three halves of the thought expressing
synonymous concepts:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Psalm 19:1 --
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;The heavens declare the glory of God;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The skies proclaim the work of his hands.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
2. Antithetical
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Antithetical parallelism occurs when the writer expresses a concept,
and then follows it immediately with its opposite:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Psalm 37:37-38 --
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;Consider the blameless,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
observe the upright;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
there is a future for the man of peace.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
But all sinners will be destroyed;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
the future of the wicked will be cut off.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Proverbs 17:22 --
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
A cheerful heart is good medicine,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
but a crushed spirit dries up the bones.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
3. Completion
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Rather than repeating or contrasting a concept, sometimes the
writer simply continues the thought, bringing it to its logical,
ultimate completion or end.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Proverbs 17:23 --
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
A wicked man accepts a bribe in secret
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
to pervert the course of justice.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
There are, of course, many variations on these basic formats;
but this should be enough to give the reader a good basic concept
of the principles involved.
<P>
The books, and parts of books, of the Bible that are poetic in
nature are as follows (some books listed as poetry may have sections
that are prose; in modern translations, the poetic sections are
clearly differentiated from prose):

<B>The Book of Psalms</B> 
<P>
<B>I. Title</B> 
<P>
The book is called the Book of Psalms; the English word &quot;psalm&quot;
is derived from the Greek word <I>psalmos</I>, which is itself
a translation of the Hebrew word <I>mizmor</I>, which refers either
to instrumental music or a song. For practical purposes, the English
title means &quot;Book of Songs&quot;. The traditional Hebrew
title is <I>sefer tehilim</I>, which means &quot;Book of Praises&quot;.
<P>
<B>II. Author and Setting</B> 
<P>
The book of Psalms is an amalgam of the work of several individuals;
the one responsible for editing and arranging the individual psalms
in their current framework is unknown. One tradition attributes
the job to Ezra. The authorship of the individual psalms, as attributed
by their titles, breaks down as follows (of the 150 psalms, 116
are provided with a title):
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Moses -- Psalm 90
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Heman the Ezrahite -- Psalm 88
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Ethan the Ezrahite -- Psalm 89
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Solomon -- Psalm 72, 127
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
David (73 times) -- Psalms 3-9; 11-32; 34-41; 51-65; 68-70; 86;
103; 108- 110; 122; 124; 131; 133; 138-145
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Asaph (12 times) -- Psalms 50; 73-83
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Sons of Korah (9 times) -- Psalm 42; 44-45; 47-49; 84-85; 87
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Author unknown (49 times)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The Septuagint gives additional authorship identifications as
follows:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Jeremiah -- Psalm 137
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Haggai and Zechariah -- Psalms 146-147
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Ezra -- Psalm 119
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Hezekiah (15 times) Psalms 120-134
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Duplicate Psalms:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Psalm 14 and 53 (notice 14 uses <I>Yahweh, </I>traditionally &quot;Lord&quot;,
and 53 uses <I>Elohim</I> &quot;God&quot;).
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Psalm 40:13-17 and Psalm 70
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Psalm 108 and Psalm 57:7-11 plus 60:5-12
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The titles prefaced to 116 of the psalms date back to a time before
200 BC (the translations of the Septuagint); they may, however,
not be authoritative.
<P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<B>III. Outline of the Book of Psalms</B>
