<B>The Book of Romans</B> 
<P>
<B>I. Title</B> 
<P>
As with most of the other letters, the letter derives its title
from those to whom it is addressed, the church in Rome.
<P>
<B>II. Author and Setting</B> 
<P>
Paul is the author of the book of Romans. The question naturally
arises, &quot;what was the occasion for writing such a letter?&quot;
E.F. Harrison writes:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
First, since Paul hoped to go beyond Rome even as far as Spain,
he evidently expected to have in the Roman church a base of missionary
operation comparable to Antioch in the East. If this was to be
realized, he needed to share with the church a rather complete
exposition of the gospel he had been preaching for over twenty
years. By putting this exposition in writing and sending it ahead,
he would give the Christian community in Rome an opportunity to
digest the message and be ready to share in the extension of the
gospel to the West.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Another factor may have entered in. The very passage that sets
forth his plan and purpose is followed by one requesting prayer
for his safety and success as he went on to Judea prior to leaving
for Rome. Particularly ominous is his expressed need to be delivered
from unbelievers in Judea (Rom 15:31). The plot by the Jews ad
Corinth against his life (Acts 20:3) may already have been made
and become an omen of future events. Possibly at this point intimations
from the Holy Spirit began to warn him about the imprisonment
and afflictions that awaited him (Acts 20:23). What if he should
not live to declare the gospel in the West? Then he must write
a letter so systematic and comprehensive that the church would
be able intelligently to continue his work, proclaiming the very
gospel he was spelling out for them, taking it in his stead to
the furthest reaches of the empire. For all he knew at the time,
this letter might be in a sense his last will and testament, a
precious deposit bequeathed to the church and through it to the
community of the faithful everywhere.
