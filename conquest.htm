<P>
<I><B>Who are the Canaanites</B></I>
<P>
 The Canaanites were the inhabitants of Canaan, the older native
name of Palestine.  As a geographical designation, the Hebrew
form of &quot;Canaan&quot; seems to be derived from &quot;Hurrian&quot;,
meaning &quot;belonging to the land of red purple.&quot;  As early
as the fourteenth century BC this term came to be used of the
country in which the Canaanites, or Phoenician traders, exchanged
for their wares their most important commercial commodity, red
purple dye, which was obtained from the murex shells found on
the shores of the eastern Mediterranean.  Accordingly, the Amarna
Letters apply the term &quot;Land of Canaan&quot; to the Phoenician
coast, and the Egyptians referred to all of western Syria by this
name.
<P>
 By the time of the Conquest, however, the term Canaan was in
vogue as the general designation of the territory later called
Palestine.  Canaanites lived in both the eastern and western part
of the country (Josh. 11:3).  According to Judges 1:9, 10, they
were praactically everywhere, in the hill country, the Negev,
the Shephelah, and Hebron.  &quot;The language of Canaan&quot;
(Is. 19:18) refers principally to Hebrew, but embraces the general
West Semitic languages spoken in this territory, of which Phoenician
and Moabite were also dialects.
<P>
 The name Palestine, as a geographical term, is of later origin
and is derived from the Philistines (<I>peleste</I>) who settled
in large numbers along the southern coast in the twefth century
BC.  The area where they settled became known as Philisita (Joel
3:4), from which, in turn, the Greek name (<I>he palestine</I>)
was derived (interesting note: in Hebrew, Palestinians, for instance
as in Palestianian Liberation Organization, is called a philisti.
 This term appears in the Bible and is translated there as Philistine.
 Israeli is simply the English transliteration of the Hebrew yisraeli,
which appears in the Bible also and there is translated into English
as Israelite.  One gets a very interesting and different perspective
on current events in the Middle East if you think in terms of
the Israelites against the Philistines.  Makes it easy to figure
out who the good guys are, in case you had any doubts.  Is the
current Israel the Israel of the restoration?  see Hosea 11:10-11.
 Behind yahweh they will go [reversal of 2a].  Because he roars,
his children -- i.e., the Israelites -- will return, but they
do not return in joy, but in a state of shock and fright, in a
time of disaster and panic.  The word &quot;tremble&quot; is usually
the result of dread at a sudden noise, the meaning of which is
not understood, by which probably is indicated that something
is wrong.  They return from the west -- literally, &quot;sea&quot;.
 The use of the verb &quot;to tremble&quot; and the statement
from &quot;the sea&quot; gives us a clue as to the restoration
being described here.  It is not the restoration of Ezra's time
after the Babylonian captivity.  They did not come from the west
or the sea then -- only from Assyria and Egypt.  What is described
here best fits the return in the twentieth century to the establishment
of the present state of Israel.  Notice in this jpassage that
there is no recognition of sin, no repentance, no turning to God.
 they come, and not in joy, but in fear.
<P>
 The NIV translates taht they come when he roars, literally, &quot;because
he roars.&quot;  That is, because of the action of God, they come
trembling.
<P>
 Following World War II thousands and thousands of Jewish people
fled Europe, coming on ships toward the land of Palestine.  Many
were stopped by the British and housed in concentration camps
on Cyprus until Israel became independent in 1948.  Many emigrants
also came from the Arab countries, to the north and east and from
Egypt in the South.  They left evrything they owned, many times.
 And they came trembling, not with assurance. See Deuteronomy
28:64-67.  In the Nazi camps, in the morning the Germans would
line the Jews up, pick a few at random, and those were were randomly
selected would be gassed. At night, the same process would be
repeated.  See also Ezekiel 37 -- the Dry Bones.)
<P>
<I><B>The Invasion of  Canaan</B></I>
<P>
 In the great pagan centers on the Nile and the Tigris there was
always an active movement of religious and cultural elements which
tended to create an almost imperceptible synthesis.  Throughout
the many centuries preceding the Israelite conquest this syncretizing
process had been operative upon the pre-Israelite inhabitants
of Syro-Palestine, so that by the time of Israel's entrance into
the land the Canaanites were enslaved by a morally degenerate
paganism.
<P>
 Israel's conquest of the land would be the ultimate fulfillment
of Gen. 9:25-27 (see also Josh. 9:22-22).
<P>
<B> Israel's Opportunity and Peril in the Conquest</B>
<P>
 In this moral and religious situation, which confronted Israel
on the eve of the Conquest, lay the Hebrew nation's greatest opportunity
for witness to its distinctive calling and mission and at the
same time its greatest peril.  if the nation would remain loyal
to its call to separation and resist incessant pressure from all
sides to yield to moral and religious syncretism with surrounding
paganism, the discharge of its high task of world-blessing would
be assured (Ex. 19:5-7).
<P>
 If, however, the nation compromised its moral and spiritual separateness,
its witness was doomed, its role of blessing forfeited.  This
is the reason the Israelites were divinely commanded to not only
utterly destroy the Cannanites, who by their idolatry and wickedness
had forfeited their rights to the land of Canaan, but also to
possess their land and to keep themselves in rigid and uncompromising
separation from the idolatry that led to their corruption and
downfall (Gen. 15:16; Josh. 6:17, 21; Judges 2:1-3).
<P>
 What they faced is the same thing we face today.  To be a Christian
is almost fashionable, or at least not horribly unacceptable.
 It is difficult to make fun of a group when one of their number
becomes President of the United States (i.e., Jimmy Carter or,
for that matter, Bill Clinton -- also the Gores are both Southern
Baptists, and for that matter, so was Harry Truman).  However,
as we are acceptable, this is still within firm limits.  It is
okay to believe anything, just so long as you don't bother anyone
with it.  Live and let live.  Don't hassle thy neighbor.  Alternate
life-styles and all.  And unfortunately, many evangelicals have
accepted this idea.  In so doing, evangelicals, for the most part,
have lost their purpose, the very meaning of their name.  We don't
evangelize!  It is not acceptable.  We don't want anyone thinking
we're a JW or worse yet, a Moonie.  Instead, of evangelizing,
a lot of evangelicals are busy lobbying for new laws, completely
obscuring the gospel in so doing.
<P>
<B> The Biblical Resume of the Conquest</B>
<P>
 After signal victories in Transjordan over Sihon, king of the
Amorites and Og, king of Bashan, Israel after the death of Moses
and under Joshua's leadership, passed over Jordan and began the
Conquest.  The story of the Conquest is told in Joshua 1 to 12,
and the allocation of the land to the various tribes is related
in Joshua 13-22.  After the destruction of Jericho and Ai  (Josh.
6:1-8:29), the conquest of southern Canaan (10) and northern Canaan
(11:1-5) is described.  Joshua 11:16-12:24 summarizes the Conquest
as a whole.
<P>
 The events recorded in the biblical account are evidently highly
selective.  Summary statements (21:43-45) seemingly embrace other
conquests not specifically described in the book.  Those which
are included were considered sufficient to accomplish the author's
purpose of proving God's faithfulness to His people to give them
the land of Canaan for their possession.
<P>
<I><B>The Date of the Conquest</B></I>
<P>
 The question of the date of the Conquest is of a piece with the
problem of the date of the Exodus.  Both as yet contain many unsolved
difficulties and are subject to limitless disagreement among scholars.
 As one wrote (Miller Burrows): &quot;It must be acknowledged
that archeology has not simplified the problems of the date of
the Conquest, but has rather introduced new complications.&quot;
<P>
<B> Biblical Account of the Conquest Abbreviated</B>
<P>
 The quite detailed account of certain phases of the Israelite
victories, particularly the initial successes at Jericho and Ai,
and the extremely abbreviated report of some of the other campaigns,
for example, that in northern Canaan (Josh. 11:1-5), with apparently
some important battles unmentioned, have combined to give the
impression of simplicity and have thus obscured to some extent
the original complexity, which in turn is undoubtedly being revealed
by archeology.  However, the account in Joshua does indicate that
the problem is complicated by the fact that the Conquest did not
take place all at once, but in stages.
<P>
 It is clear, for example, that the Transjordan was conquered
by Moses, much of eastern and central Palestine by Joshua, and
the remaining portions by the tribes either before or after the
death of Joshua (Judges 1:1-36), while other individual towns
like Gezer (Judges 1:29, 1 Kings 9:16), Dor, Megiddo, Taanach
and Bethshan (Judges 1:27-28) were not subdued until much later.
<P>
<B> Biblical Chronology and the Conquest</B>
<P>
 If the biblical narratives are accepted as reliable sources and
the Biblical chronology followed, the Exodus, as already noted,
must be placed around 1441 BC and the fall of Jericho around 1401
BC.  With this agrees the view of the British excavator of Jericho,
John Garstang.  The chronological notices in Judges 11:26 and
1 Kings 6:1 support this position, as well as the evident time
scheme underlying the OT historical books to the Solomonic era.
 In addition, this position has the distinct advantage of allowing
at least a partial equation of the Habiru of the Amarna letters
and the Israelites led by Joshua.
<P>
<B> Alleged Conflicting Archeological Data at Ai</B>
<P>
 A 1401 BC date of the beginning of the conquest is supposed to
violate the assured results of archeological findings in Palestine,
notably at Ai, Lachish, and Debir.  The problem of Ai is indeed
acute, if the mound of et Tell is actually the biblical city.
 Excavation of the site by Mme. Judith Marquet-Krause in 1933
and 1934 has shown that there was an occupational gap in the history
of the mound from about 2200 BC until after 1200 BC, so that supposedly
there was nothing but a ruin there when Joshua and Israel are
said to have captured and destroyed it (Josh. 8).
<P>
 Some critics, like Martin Noth, attempt a solution to the problem
by radically dismissing the biblical story as an aetiological
(a story made up to explain why something is the way it is, as
in Native American stories about &quot;how the bear lost his tail&quot;
or the like) legend, which supposedly explains how the place came
to be in ruins and to be called &quot;Ruin&quot; (the meaning
of Ai in Hebrew, after all).  A less radical explanation, but
one which scarcely accords much more historical reliability to
the biblical account is that of Albright, who assumes that the
narraive in Joshua 8 originally referred to the destruction of
Bethel in the 13th century BC but that the aetiological interest
in the ruins of Ai caused the story to be attached to this site
instead of Bethel.  But this assumption, besides being objectionable
in that it reflects upon the genuine historicity of the biblical
account, is extremely unlikely ecause the biblical narrative carefully
distinguishes between the two cities (Joshua 8:12) and there is
not the slitest hint of any destruction of Bethel at this time.
<P>
 However, the destruction of Bethel in the 13th century BC by
a tremendous conflagration, shown in the excavation of the site
in 1934 by a joint expedition of the Pittsburgh-Xenia Theological
Seminary and the American Schools of Oriental Research, under
the leadership of Albright, undoubtedly is to be connected with
the later destruction of the city by the tribe of Joseph quite
some time after Joshua's death (Judges 1:22-26).
<P>
 More reasonable is the explanation of Father Hughes Vincint that
the inhabitants of Ai had merely a military outpost at Ai of such
modest proportions and temporary nature that it left no remains
to give a clue of its existence to the archeologists. However,
the narrative clearly indicates an inhabited city.
<P>
 Whatever the explanation, further investigation and excavation
in the vicinity will doubtless yield the correct solution.  It
is still barely possible as Vincent suggests, that there was a
settlement in Joshua's day there, although no trace of it has
as yet been found.  The biblical narrative stressed the smallness
of the then-existing city (Josh. 7:3), which may have been nothing
more than a fortress guarding Bethel. Then too, it should be remembered,
as Sir Frederick Kenyon observed, &quot;the the transference of
a name from a ruined or abandoned site to another nearby is a
common phenomenon in Palestine.&quot;  Future research may establish
the actual site of the late Bronze Age city which fell to Joshua
is not et-Tell at all, but somewhere in the immediate or more
remote vicinity of the ancient ruin, and discover that the name
of the older city was transferred to it.
<P>
<B> Alleged Evidence from Lachish</B>
<P>
 Archeological findings at Lachish (Tell ed-Duweir), the capture
of which by Joshua and all Israel is related in Joshua 10:31-33,
show that the city suffered violent destruction by fire about
1230 BC.  A thick layer of ash containing a scarab of Rameses
II, an inscribed bowl and several other details combine to establish
the date.  But the question may fairly be broached, is this destrction
to be attributed to the invading Israelites under Joshua?  Advocates
of the late-date theories of the conquest readily assume this
to be the case.  But besides being complete out of focus with
the findings at Jericho and the general biblical datings, the
fact must be faced that the biblical record says not a word about
the city itself being burned or destroyed when captured by Joshua.
 Rather, in the light of Joshua 11:13 it is clearly to be intimated
that in the case of &quot;cities that stood upon their mounds&quot;,
it was Joshua's later military policy, and with few exceptions,
to burn <I>none</I> of them.
<P>
<B> Alleged Evidence from Debir</B>
<P>
 The city of Debir, earlier known as Kiriath Sepher, offers a
similar example.  Now identified with Tel Beit Mirsim, thirteen
miles soutwest of Hebron, the mound was excavated in 1926 by a
joint expedition of the Pittsburgh-Xenia Theological Seminary
and the American Schools of Oriental Research at Jerusalem under
the direction of Melvin Grove Kyle and W.F. Albright.  Here, too,
at the end of the Late Bronze Age there is a great burned layer,
above which are Israelite remains.  But is this destruction of
the Canaanite city shortly before 1200 BC to be connected with
Joshua's conquests?  he conqueror is not said to have destroyed
the city itself (Josh. 10:38-39) but only its inhabitants, and
it must have been reoccupied by the Canaanites and subsequently
recaptured for Judah by Caleb's nephew, Othniel (Josh. 15:15-17),
Judges 1:11-13), unless two variant and contradictory accounts
are assumed.
<P>
<B> Necessity of Caution in Using Archeological Data</B>
<P>
 It is thus apparent that investigators must be extremely careful
of the ever-present temptation to misuse archeological evidence
to support a theory; that is, to use only some of the evidence
available for a given question and, because it doesn't support
the theory, to ignore or assume erroneous other data.  This is
a caution for all sides on the debate.
<P>
 Scholars must also be extremely wary of attaching undue authority
to acheologist's estimates of dates and interpretation of data.
That the fixing of dates and the conclusions drawn from archeological
findings are too often dependent on subjective rather than objective
factors is amply demonstrated by the wise divergence between compentent
authorities on these matters.
<P>
 On the question of the twin problems of the date of the Exodus
and the conquest of Canaan the conservative student is warranted
in moving very slowly before abandoning the date of c. 1441 BC
for the Exodus and 1401 BC for the Conquest in favor of a period
a century and a half or more later under the plea that archeological
evidence demands it.  Of greater importance is the reading given
in scripture.
<P>
<I><B>The Extent of the Conquest</B></I>
<P>
 In the account of the invasion of Canaan under Joshua (Josh.
1-12), it is apparent that, although the power of the Canaanites
was broken by the destruction of Jericho and Ai (Joshua 6-8),
as a result of the southern (10) and northern (11:1-5) campaigns,
yet the inhabitants were not wholly exterminated (Judges 1:1-36).
<P>
<B> Extermination of the Canaanites Not Complete</B>
<P>
 Although the Canaanites were completely massacred when a city
was taken, yet in many cases the city itself was not destroyed
(Josh. 11:13), and not a few of the people who had escaped by
flight or were in hiding returned (Josh. 10:43) to the conquered
cities, and years afterward, when the tribes of Israel were scattered
to settle, they met with sporadic resistance.  Accordingly, places
once conquered like Debir (Josh. 10:38-39) had to be subsequently
reconquered (Judges 1:11-15).  Among other similar cases is Hebron
(Josh. 10:36-37, Judges 1:10) [alternately, the &quot;retakings&quot;
may merely be &quot;retellings&quot; of the same story from different
perspectives, with different emphases.  Keep in mind the tendency
to tell stories thematically, letting chronological order take
a back seat].
<P>
 Joshua's Political Blunders
<P>
 Three political blunders were committed by Joshua.  First, he
made a treaty with the Gibeonites (Josh. 9).  Second, he allowed
the Jebusites to hold Jerusalem (Josh. 15:63), and third, he failed
to dispossess the Philistines and control the country to the sea.
 As a result, Judah and Simeon were cut off from the rest of the
nation.  The Jebusite stronghold at Jerusalem commanded the main
road north and south and was skirted for some ten miles on the
west by settlements of the Gibeonites.  Between Jerusalem and
Jericho was a tract of rocky land cut by impassible gorges running
east and west.  From Jerusalem westward to the Mediterranean Sea
was a strip of territory occupied by foreigners -- first Gibeonites,
then other Canaanites in Dan and then the Philistines as far as
the sea.  This situation was to have serious repercussions affecting
subsequent Israelite history, not least of which was the fact
that the northern tribes remained somewhat separated in their
thinking from Judah, perhaps easing the subsequent splitting of
the kingdom after Solomon.
<P>
 And Joshua and Israel failed to drive the Canaanites out of various
other sections of the country -- notably out of Gezer (Josh. 16:10)
and out of Bethshan, Ibleam, Dor, Endor, Taanach and Megiddo in
and about the Plain of Esdraelon (josh. 17:11); out of Beth-shemesh
in the Shephelah (Judges 1:33), and out of the region of Accho
and Sidon in the northwestern coastal territory (Judges 1:31).
 Wherever the Canaanites were allowed to remain they were to prove
a snare to the Israelites, according to the divine warning (Judges
3:6-7).
