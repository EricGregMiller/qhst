<center><h1><B>9. Is Jesus God?</B></h1></center>
<p>
A central tenet of Christianity is that Jesus is God. Does the Bible really say that Jesus is God? Throughout Christian history there have been some who say it does not. Such claims are still alive today.
<br/><br/>
The simple answer is, "Yes, Jesus is God."
The biblical evidence for Jesus' divinty is overwhelming and there really should be no argument.
<br/><br/>
All the evidence and discussion of Jesus' godhood are too big for a simple FAQ. 
A very good discussion of the issue is <a href="/journal/volume1/trinity.htm">this QHST Journal article</a> by Professor Nettelhorst and Steve McWilliams. 
<br/><br/>
The Jehovah's Witnesses are one group that agressively denies Jesus is God. 
They often focus on denying the simple statement in John 1:1 "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God and the Word was God." 
Professor Miller received <a href="/QHST/Courses/Languages/jw.html">this paper</a> that contained such arguments. 
<a href="/QHST/Courses/Languages/JohnPrologueArticleResponse.html">His response</a> answers all the points of the Jehovah's Witness paper and provides a good overview of relevant Greek grammar issues.
