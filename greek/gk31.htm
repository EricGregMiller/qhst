<B>ASSIGNMENT:</B>  Memorize the vocabulary above.<P>

	The infinitive can be used as both a verb and a noun.  When it is used as a verb it expresses the purpose of the main verb; i.e., "the child likes to run".  In this example, "likes" is the main verb, and "to run", the infinitive, expresses what the child likes to do.<P>
	When the infinitive is used as a noun it is simply being used as the object of the main verb.  Examples of this kind of usage abound in the New Testament.<P>

<B>ASSIGNMENT:</B>  Translate I John 2:18-29.<P>

	Well, dear student, if you have done all of the work asked of you you have in hand the necessary tools with which to study the New Testament in its original language.<P>
	What you must do now is read, read, and read some more in the New Testament itself.  Translation is an art as well as a skill; and only by practice can your translating arrive at that level.<P>
	Farewell, and stick with it.<P><P><P>

	For further study, get a copy of Blass-Debrunner's <I>New Testament Greek Grammar</I>.<P>
