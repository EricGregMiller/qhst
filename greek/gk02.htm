<CENTER><H2>Lesson 2: Breathing Marks</H2>
</CENTER>

When <FONT FACE="SPIonic">r</FONT> begins a word, it must have what is called the rough breathing mark, 
(a  <FONT FACE="SPIonic"> & </FONT> on top of it), and when any word begins with a vowel it also must have either a rough breathing mark, or a smooth breathing mark ( an <FONT FACE="SPIonic"> 0</FONT>  on top of it).  For example:<P>
<FONT FACE="SPIonic">r& </FONT> = a rough breathing mark (pronounced with an "h" sound)<P>

<FONT FACE="SPIonic">a0</FONT> = a smooth breathing mark pronounced simply as "a"<P>



<CENTER><H3>Accent Marks</H3>
</CENTER><P>
	The marks found above letters in Greek are called accent marks (apart from the rough and smooth breathing marks we have already discussed).  These marks help in pronunciation of words; but we will simply note them and not memorize them.  Usage will, in the long run, make these marks self explanatory.<P>


<CENTER><H3>Punctuation Marks</H3>
</CENTER><P>
	In Greek there are 4 punctuation marks; the comma (<FONT FACE="SPIonic">,</FONT>) and period (<FONT FACE="SPIonic">.</FONT>) correspond to the English comma and period.   The colon (<FONT FACE="SPIonic">:</FONT>) appears above the line and corresponds to the English colon.  The question mark (<FONT FACE="SPIonic">;</FONT>) is this sign.<P>
