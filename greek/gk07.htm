	The first thing the student will notice is that some of the prepositions have different meanings when they occur with a particular case.  These distincitions must be learned.<P>

<B>ASSIGNMENT:</B>  The vocabulary above must be memorized.<P>

	Prepositions are words that help nouns, verbs and adjectives express themselves clearly.   Prepositions do not change in form, as do nouns, verbs and adjectives.  The forms above are the forms that will always occur, with one small exception.<P>
	Prepositions ending with a vowel (except <FONT FACE="SPIonic">pro</FONT> and <FONT FACE="SPIonic">peri</FONT>) drop that vowel when the next word in the sentence begins with a vowel.  For example:<P>

<CENTER><FONT FACE="SPIonic">a0po a0delfou</FONT> becomes <FONT FACE="SPIonic">a0p a0delfou</FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="SPIonic">dia h(mera</FONT> becomes <FONT FACE="SPIonic">di h(mera</FONT>, etc.<P></CENTER>

Note:  Prepositions have shades of meaning that are not indicated above.  The translator must be sensitive to the context to translate them correctly, as well as make liberal use of the lexicon.<P>
<B>ASSIGNMENT:</B>  Translate the following sentences:<P>

1. <FONT FACE="SPIonic">o( a0postoloj didaskei e0n th| e0kklesia|</FONT><P>

2. <FONT FACE="SPIonic">o( maqhthj legei parabolhn peri thj basileiaj</FONT><P>

3. <FONT FACE="SPIonic">o( messiaj legei parabolhn e0n logoij a0lhqeiaj</FONT><P>
