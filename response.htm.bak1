<p><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Introduction:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
tendency when faced with crackpot ideas is to ignore them.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Since they are so ludicrous to those who
know better, it seems unnecessary to refute them.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>For instance, there is a Flat Earth Society headquartered in
Lancaster, California.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It is unlikely
that one will find detailed refutations of their point of view, not because
their point of view cannot be refuted, but just because it seems not worth the
effort.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
arguments raised by those who hate the Jewish people generally strike most the
same way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Anti-Semitism is so obviously
wrong that spending the time to refute the arguments would seem to make as much
sense as bothering with the Flat Earth Society.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Like the Flat Earth Society, the anti-Semitic arguments are long,
complex, and filled with so many details that it would take some time to tackle
them all point by point.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>      </span>However, the anti-Semites of the world,
unlike those who believe in a flat earth, have historically been dangerous, and
are responsible for killing millions of people.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>They continue, year after year, to use the same tired arguments
that they have been using for years to justify their hatred and desire to
persecute the Jewish people.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A search
on the Internet of certain key terms in the anti-Semitic lexicon brings up the
same articles, virtually word for word, on any number of hate sites.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Therefore, since the arguments are
unchanging, once an answer has been given, it won’t be necessary to do it
again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And because of the harm that
anti-Semitism has caused, an answer <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>must</i>
be given.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>One of the most common arguments of
the anti-Semites is the charge that the Jewish people aren’t really Jews at
all, but some sort of imposters pretending to be Jewish.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Why would the anti-Semites make such a
claim?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Since the Bible condemns those
who hate the people of Israel, the Jew haters who wish to call themselves
Christians are forced to try to prove that the Jewish people aren’t really from
Israel, and that the “true Jews” are instead, they themselves.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Thus, they imagine that their anti-Semitism
is only proper, because they are simply trying to protect the true Jews
(themselves) from the hateful anti-Jews (the people who call themselves Jews)
who would seek to destroy them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They turn
the focus of the patriarchal covenant of Genesis 12:1-3 on its head.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>This odd
anti-Semitic argument that tries to turn the Jews into imposters may be broken
down into three points: first, a linguistic and biblical argument, which
attempts to prove that Jews are not part of Israel; second, a historical
argument, which attempts to identify the people who are claiming to be Jews as
actually being Khazars rather than descendents of Israel; and third, the
attempt to identify the Anglo-Saxon people as the true Israelites.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>We will look at each point in
turn.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The fundamental problem with the
anti-Semitic argument is that not only is it false historically, biblically and
linguistically, but more significantly, it stands in violation of the central
theme of the Bible, which is to love God and to love people.</p>

The Jews Aren’t Really Jewish<o:p></o:p></span></h1>

<p style='text-indent:.5in'>Some anti-Semites argue that the word Jew can be
applied to people who are not actually, in any way, descended from the ancient
people of Israel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Furthermore, they
will try to argue that the Israeli government itself admits this shocking fact,
that today’s Jews aren’t really Israelites at all.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Additionally, attempts will be made to convince readers that
Paul, and other biblical characters in the New Testament, are not actually
Jewish, either.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Consider the following
quotations from some anti-Semitic literature:</p>

<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.5in;
margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>An important question answered from reason and
historic Biblical fact is that the word Jew comes from a Greek word meaning
descendent of the tribe of Judah, or someone living in the land of Judea.
Today's Jews call themselves Jews to falsely imply that they are somehow
descendent and have blood links to the Biblical tribe of Judah. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.5in;
margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Most churches today make no distinction between
these terms – a fatal mistake! One of their arguments is that the Apostle Paul
said in Romans 11:1 that he was an &quot;Israelite,&quot; and then in Phil. 3:5
he called himself &quot;a Hebrew of the Hebrews.&quot; Therefore, they say, the
terms are identical, and by implication they include the word &quot;Jew&quot;
as well. However, Paul was also a Benjamite (Rom. 11:1), but the fact that he
descended from Benjamin, Israel, and Heber did not mean that all of these men
were the same person.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Therefore
in summary, we can clearly see that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

our Lord Jesus Christ so openly despised! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'>From a very early
time the Khazars were a diverse and generally tolerant people. An order listing
people being called up for military duty from the early days of the Khazar
kingdom indicates that there were people with all sorts of hairstyles, living
quarters, and lifestyles in the country. But it would be a mistake to interpret
the Islamic sources by arguing that the Khazars were not Jews. Rather, the
inhabitants of Khazaria were of diverse origins - Iranians, Turks, Slavs,
Greeks, Goths, and others - and we cannot expect them to have always followed
the faith of the ruling Khazar tribe, because the Khazar king never forced the
religion of Judaism upon them. </p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'>It seems that
after the fall of their kingdom, the Khazars adopted the Cyrillic script in
place of Hebrew and began to speak East Slavic (sometimes called
&quot;Canaanic&quot; because Benjamin of Tudela called Kievan Rus the
&quot;Land of Canaan&quot;). These Slavic-speaking Jews are documented to have
lived in Kievan Rus during the 11th-13th centuries. However, Yiddish-speaking
Jewish immigrants from the west (especially Germany, Bohemia, and other areas
of Central Europe) soon began to flood into Eastern Europe, and it is believed
that these newer immigrants eventually outnumbered the Khazars. Thus, Eastern
European Jews predominantly have ancestors who came from Central Europe rather
than from the Khazar kingdom. The two groups (eastern and western Jews)
intermarried over the centuries. This idea is not new. In a footnote in Chapter
2 of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>History of the Jews in Russia and
Poland</i> Volume 1 (English translation, 1916), the Ashkenazic historian Simon
Dubnow writes: &quot;It is quite possible that there was an admixture of
settlers from the Khazar kingdom, from the Crimea, and from the Orient in general,
who were afterwards merged with the western element.&quot; (page 39). </p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'>The Ashkenazi Jews
are also the direct descendants of the Israelites. Genetic tests seem to
indicate some ancestry from the regions known today as Turkey, Armenia,
Georgia, and Iraq. Mediterranean Fever, for example, is found among some
Ashkenazi Jews as well as Armenians and Anatolian Turks. It is now asserted
that many Ashkenazi men who belong to the priestly caste (Kohenim) possess a
&quot;Kohen&quot; marker on the Y-chromosome. </p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'>A genetics study
released in May 2000, led by Michael Hammer, contends that the results show
that Ashkenazi Jews are more closely related to Yemenite Jews, Iraqi Jews,
Sephardic Jews, Kurdish Jews, and Arabs than they are to European Christian
populations, and that hardly any intermarriage or conversion has occurred to
affect the Jewish groups over the centuries. </p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'>Additional, more
comprehensive genetic testing may help us to understand the extent of any
Khazar contribution to the Ashkenazi gene pool. For now, it is clear that the
Israelite traces among the East European Jews came from three sources: first,
Sephardic Jews fleeing Spain and Portugal and resettling in Lithuania and
Poland; second, Roman Jews, and third, Khazarian Jews who merged with
Israelites, just as the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Schechter Letter</i>

it's not what's going to get us (or anyone else) into heaven.</p>
