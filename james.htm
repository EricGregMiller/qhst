<B>The Book of James</B> 
<P>
<B>I. Title</B> 
<P>
The title comes from the name of the author of this letter.
<P>
<B>II. Author and Setting</B> 
<P>
According to James 1:1, the letter was written by James:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
To the twelve tribes scattered among the nations:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Greetings.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Questions arise as to the identification of this James. Tradition
holds to this being James the Apostle, that is, the brother of
Jesus (Mark 6:3), who was the ruling elder in the Jerusalem church
before his martyrdom AD 62. A date prior to the council of Jerusalem
of AD 48/49 (Acts 15) is very possible, making this the oldest
book in the New Testament.
<P>
The other possibility, that it was written by James son of Zebedee,
is unlikely, since he was martyred about AD 44, which was probably
too early for a letter like this to have been written.
<P>
The book falls into the category or genre of wisdom literature.
For more information on wisdom literature, see the discussion
on Proverbs.

<B>Questions on James</B> 
<P>
1. Compare and contrast James' use of Abraham in James 2:20-24
and Paul's use in Galatians 3:6-14 and Romans 4. Is there a contradiction?
<P>
2. Is James advocating salvation by works? Why or why not?
<P>
3. Discuss James' teaching on the tongue.
