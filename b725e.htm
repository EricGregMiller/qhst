<B><I>Tradition Criticism</I></B>
<P>
 The final method we will investigate is tradition criticism.
 This method is simply what its name implies; tradition criticism
seeks to understand how the traditions of the Bible are used by
other Biblical writers.  That is, how is the Exodus understood by other biblical authors?
 How do the Prophets view the wilderness period?  How are the
sayings of Jesus used by the Apostles?  Tradition criticism is
a fascinating method because it is in essence the Biblical author's
commentary on the traditions of Israel!
<P>
 When one performs tradition criticism, one:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>1.</B> Finds the earliest reference to the tradition being investigated.
 This does not necessarily mean in Genesis or Matthew.  Rather,
one must be familiar enough with the chronological development
of the Bible that he or she can determine where the earliest reference
to a tradition is.  For example, Hosea was written well before
Exodus; thus the earliest reference to the Exodus is in Hosea,
and not in Exodus!  The student must be thoroughly familiar with
these issues in order to accuarately trace the traditions of the
Bible!
<P>
<B>2.</B> Examines the similarities and the differences in the accounts
of the tradition.  For example, in Jeremiah the wilderness period
is viewed as a time of faithfulness and obedience while in Numbers
it is seen as a period of constant disobedience.  Why the differences?
 What could the theological or historical reason for these differences
be?</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>


 In practicing tradition criticism, one needs to ask the following
particular questions:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>a.</B> What is the &quot;word&quot; which embodies the tradition-
and what is the broader &quot;word field&quot; used to describe
the event?  For example, &quot;passover&quot; is also called the
&quot;feast of unleavend bread&quot;.  Are these the same? Or
different?
<P>
<B>b.</B> Is there a formulaic structure which is always used when the
tradition is described? I.e., when the Prophets speak for God,
the text generally says &quot;thus says the Lord'.  is this formula
always present in the prophetic traditions?  Is it left out? 
Why?
<P>
<B>c.</B> Are there parallels?  A famous example of this is David's Census
(in 2 Samuel 24 and  1 Chronicles 22).  The passage in Samuel
says:  <P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;Again the anger of the <B>Lord</B> was kindled against
Israel, and he incited David against them, saying, &quot;Go, count
the people of Israel and Judah.&quot;   </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
In Samuel, the Lord incites David, but in Chronicles, it is Satan who does
so!
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;<B>Satan</B> stood up against Israel, and incited David
to count the people of Israel&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
What is one to make of this?  How is the tradition of the census
altered by the Chronicler?  Why?</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 Another example of the use of tradition criticism is made clear
when we examine how the New Testament writers were able to so
intertwine the Old Testament traditions that only those well familiar
with the Old Testament are able to discern these traditions. 
To illustrate, the following passages are offered:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Psalm 23</B><P>
The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.<P>
 He makes me lie down in green pastures;<P> he leads me beside still
waters; <P> he restores my soul. <P> He leads me in right paths for
his name's sake.  <P>Even though I walk through the darkest valley, <P>I
fear no evil; for you are with me; <P>your rod and your staff -- they
comfort me.  <P>You prepare a table before me in the presence of
my enemies; <P>you anoint my head with oil; <P>my cup overflows.  <P>Surely
goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, <P>and
I shall dwell in the house of the Lord my whole life long.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 In this text the Lord is described as a shepherd who feeds his
flocks on the green grass of the pleasant pasture.  This tradition
is adopted by the writers of the Gospels when they describe the
feeding of the 5000!
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Mark 6:30-39</B> <P>
The apostles gathered around Jesus, and told
him all that they had done and taught.   He said to them, &quot;Come
away to a deserted place all by yourselves and rest a while.&quot;
For many were coming and going, and they had no leisure even to
eat.  And they went away in the boat to a deserted place by themselves.<P>
Now many who saw them leaving recognized them, and they hurried there on foot from all
the towns and arrived ahead of them.  As he went ashore, he saw
a great crowd; and he had compassion for them, because they were
like sheep without a shepherd; and he began to teach them many
things.  <P>When it grew late, his disciples came to him and said,
&quot;This is a deserted place, and the hour is now very late;
send them away so that they may go into the surrounding country
and villages and buy something for themselves to eat.&quot; <P> But
he answered them, &quot;You give them something to eat.&quot;<P>
They said to him, &quot;Are we to go and buy two hundred denarii
worth of bread, and give it to them to eat?&quot; <P> And he said
to them, &quot;How many loaves have you? Go and see.&quot; <P>When
they had found out, they said, &quot;Five, and two fish.&quot;<P>
 Then he ordered them to get all the people to sit down in groups
on the green grass.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 Note -- the disciples have pity on the people because they are
like sheep!  And they sit on the green grass to eat!  The adoption
of the Psalm tradition cannot be doubted by any serious student
of the Bible.
<P>
 Tradition criticism is a very useful method.  The student of
the Bible should surely make use of it; but this can only be done
when one is thoroughly familiar with the development and content
of the Biblical text.
