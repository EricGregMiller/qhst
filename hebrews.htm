<P>
<B>The Book of Hebrews</B> 
<P>
<B>I. Title</B> 
<P>
The title is derived from the supposed addressee of the letter,
though the letter itself does not indicate to whom it was written.
<P>
<B>II. Author and Setting</B> 
<ADDRESS>
A. Author
</ADDRESS>

<P>
The author of the book of Hebrews is unrecorded. This has not
prevented a sizable amount of speculation on the part of commentators,
however. Some of the suggestions include:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
1. Barnabas. Terteullian in <I>De Pudicitia</I> 20
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
2. Paul. Origen reports that many ancients held it to be written
by Paul; Clement of Alexandria concurred, arguing that it had
originally been written in Aramaic and then translated into Greek
by Luke. Alexandrians adhered strongly to Pauline authorship;
the vehemence of his conviction consequently swayed both the Eastern
and Western churches to accept the book of Hebrews as scripture.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
3. Clement of Rome. Origen mentions that some ascribed it to Clement
of Rome.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
4. Luke. Origen says that some suggested Luke as the author.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Pauline authorship of Hebrews was not seriously questioned again
until the time of the Reformation, when Erasmus, Luther and Calvin
all disputed it.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
5. Apollos. Luther suggested Apollos as the author, an idea which
has commended itself to many scholars, though none would regard
it as any more than speculative.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
6. Philip. Ramsay suggested that Philip wrote the letter from
Caesarea after contact with Paul and sent it to the Jerusalem
church.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
7. Priscilla. Harnack made a case for Priscilla as the author,
arguing that the lack of attribution could have been because she
was a woman.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<ADDRESS>
B. Date
</ADDRESS>

<P>
Since Clement of Rome cites the letter around AD 95, it must have
been produced prior to that time. In all probability it was written
before AD 70, since there is no mention in the book of the destruction
of the Temple in Jerusalem, and such a destruction would have
surely been useful to the argument in the book. A date between
AD 66 and 70 seems probable.

<B>IV. Comment on Hebrews 6:4-8</B>
<P>
Although this passage has been used by those who attempt to argue
that salvation is conditional and dependent upon human will, it
really is not useful for that purpose. Arguments against those
who believe in a loss of salvation accept the reading that implies
the &quot;burning&quot; in verse eight refers to hell. This is
not likely, and once that is eliminated, the passage suddenly
becomes clear. The implications of this section (and a similar
section in Hebrews 10:26-31 and John 15:1-8) are made clear when
comparison is made to 1 Corinthians 3:10-15:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
1 Corinthians 3:10-15
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
By the grace God has given me, I laid a foundation as an expert
builder, and someone else is building on it. But each one should
be careful how he builds. For no one can lay any foundation other
than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ. If any man builds
on this foundation using gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay
or straw, his work will be shown for what it is, because the Day
will bring it to light. It will be revealed with fire, and the
fire will test the quality of each man's work. If what he has
built survives, he will receive his reward. If it is burned up,
he will suffer loss; he himself will be saved, but only as one
escaping through the flames.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The use of the images of fire and burning are not limited to Hell
alone, but stand as an image of God's judgment. As Hebrews 12:29
points out: &quot;for our 'God is a consuming fire.'&quot;
<P>
The judgment in view in Hebrews 6 (as well as Hebrews 10 and John
15) is physical death; the danger being warned of, is the &quot;sin
unto death&quot; discussed in 1 John 5:16-17, which is given its
illustration in the lives of Ananias and Sapphira. Those who believe
salvation is conditional upon behavior have failed to understand
the nature of unconditional love and grace, which are available
in the finished work of Jesus.

<B>V. Questions on Hebrews</B> 
<P>
1. Who are some of the proposed authors of the letter to the Hebrews?
<P>
2. Explain Hebrews 6:4-8.
<P>
3. Explain Hebrews 10:26-31.
<P>
4. What use does the author make of Melchizedek?
<P>
5. What was the point of the Old Testament sacrificial system?
<P>
6. How were people saved in the Old Testament period?
<P>
7. Hebrews 11 lists people noted for their faith. Read the Old
Testament accounts of each of the people listed, then summarize
their lives. Can you discern the element of faith in their lives?
How would you describe the moral and spiritual qualities of these
lives?
