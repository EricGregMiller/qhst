<b>INTRODUCTION AND DEFINITIONS</b>
<P>
 The phrase &quot;Old Testament Pseudepigrapha&quot; is a shorthand
description of a very extensive body of literature composed from
the 3rd century BCE to the 5th century CE.  These documents were
written in a variety of languages by a variety of believers (both
Jew and Christian) for a variety of purposes.  But, it must be
pointed out immediately at the beginning, each of the three words
in the phrase &quot;Old Testament Pseudepigrapha&quot; are very
problematic.  First, the notion that these documents are contemporaneous
with the writing of the Old Testament texts is not necessarily
true.  Second, the anachronistic idea of canon retrojected on
the texts by the term testament is likewise unfortunate.  And
the word pseudepigrapha denotes not falseness but something wholly
other.
<P>
 The texts which will be examined in this course will be examined
by me with the following presuppositions in mind.  Others have
disagreed with these presuppositions, but I believe them to be
accurate:  first- these texts were written, in the main, by Jews.
 There are, to be sure, Christian interpolations.  But these interpolations
can be easily excised thus leaving the documents intact.  Second-
the original language of these texts was either Hebrew or Aramaic.
 Jews of the 3rd century BCE to the 5th century CE would, most
naturally, write in their mother tongue.  The texts were, of course,
later translated into a large number of different la   nguages
and now only einally, the term pseudepigraphal is unfortunate
but is the best we have at hand.  It connotes for the average
reader something false.  Nothing could, however, be further from
the truth.  The authors of these documents were not interested
in deceiving but in presenting the living traditions of Israel
to a new generation.  These documents, then, are sermons and give
us an exceptionally clear view of the piety of Judaism in very
close proximity to the birth of both Rabbinic Judaism and Christianity.
