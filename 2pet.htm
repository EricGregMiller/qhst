<P>
<B>Introduction</B>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Since the Gospels recorded that Jesus said to his disciples,
&quot;there be some standing here who shall not taste death until
they see the kingdom of God come in glory&quot;, the Church has
been waiting for the promise to be fulfilled.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The problem was acute by the time 2 Peter was written around
the middle of the second century.  Those skeptics who did not
accept the notion pointed out to the Church that &quot;he has
not returned, so where is the promise of his coming?&quot;  Indeed?
 If Jesus promised to return during the lifetime of at least some
of the disciples, then where was he?  Many, if not all, of the
earliest Christians were dead and buried.  This is the central
issue which 2 Peter addresses.  He attacks as heretics those who
belittle the promise and he derides them mercilessly.
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thus, the key to interpreting this book is to understand that
it is an answer to the question, &quot;why hasn't Jesus returned?&quot;
 The entire book aims at discussing the meaning of his coming
and the apparent failure of this coming.
<P>
<B>Chapter 1</B>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B> 1 Simon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, to them
that have obtained a like precious faith with us in the righteousness
of our God and the Saviour Jesus Christ: 2 Grace to you and peace
be multiplied in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord;</B>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The introductory verses of this epistle remind the reader that
it is faith that holds one close to God and it is faith which
empowers one to remain faithful to God.  Peter is called to distribute
the grace of God among all people.  His calling, and ours, is
to share this gift with as many as we can.  But what is it that
is involved in faith?  In faith we are called to adopt and adhere
to the good will of God and abandon evil.  Along with this gift
of God's grace we are simultaneously given joy!  What else do
we need?    But faith also means that our eyes are open to the
work of God and our ears are attuned to the voice of God, or the
claim of God, on our lives.  Faith, in short, allows us to love
God more than anything else and to give God our highest allegiance.
<P>
  
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B>3 seeing that his divine power hath granted unto us all things
that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of
him that called us by his own glory and virtue; 4 whereby he hath
granted unto us his precious and exceeding great promises; that
through these ye may become partakers of the divine nature, having
escaped from the corruption that is in that world by lust. </B>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Life and piety.  These are the themes of this brief section.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We can and may be pious! And we can and may pray to God and serve
him!  We have his permission and therefore we do not need the
permission of the mob, which rather frowns at displays of religious
piety (though it praises fanatical devotion to sports).  Why may
we be pious?  Because God has bound us to himself and daily transforms
us into his own image.  
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B> 5 Yea, and for this very cause adding on your part all diligence,
in your faith supply virtue; and in your virtue knowledge; 6 and
in your knowledge self-control; and in your self-control patience;
and in your patience godliness; 7 and in your godliness brotherly
kindness; and in your brotherly kindness love.</B>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Because he binds us to himself we are called to work and serve,
just as He works and serves.   Why then should we sleep a long
time or act lazy or leave undone those things he has summoned
us to do?   With the knowledge God gives us of ourselves, we are
free to be victorious as His disciples.
<P>
  
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B> 8 For if these things are yours and abound, they make you
to be not idle nor unfruitful unto the knowledge of our Lord Jesus
Christ.</B>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In fulfilling the task to which Christ calls us, we make clear
who Jesus is and what it is that He gives to us!
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B> 9 For he that lacketh these things is blind, seeing only what
is near, having forgotten the cleansing from his old sins.</B>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The community of Jesus is open to all, not just the pure and good.
 Our baptism leveled the ground and placed us all together at
the foot of the cross. 
<P>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B>10 Wherefore, brethren, give the more diligence to make your
calling and election sure: </B>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His word makes us alive and pious; but we do not find this word,
it finds us and makes us faithful!
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B>for if ye do these things, ye shall never stumble: 11 for thus
shall be richly supplied unto you the entrance into the eternal
kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. </B>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We have been purified of our sin and made fruitful for the service
of God.
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B> 12 Wherefore I shall be ready always to put you in remembrance
of these things, though ye know them, and are established in the
truth which is with you. 13 And I think it right, as long as I
am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance;
14 knowing that the putting off of my tabernacle cometh swiftly,
even as our Lord Jesus Christ signified unto me. 15 Yea, I will
give dili!gence that at every time ye may be able after my decease
to call these things to remembrance. </B>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The call of the teacher is to share the knowledge which God has
given.  And the overriding principle which God wishes us to learn
is that we are free to be obedient.  Through Him we can be true
to His calling; and we can be ready when the end does come to
us.
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B> 16 For we did not follow cunningly devised fables, when we
made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ,
but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty.</B>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The task is to bear witness to what Jesus has done; not our own
ideas or schemes.  Note that witness is to both what Jesus has
done and is doing; as well as to what He will do.  A one dimensional
testimony is no testimony at all.
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B> 17 For he received from God the Father honor and glory, when
there was borne such a voice to him by the Majestic Glory, This
is my beloved !Son, in whom I am well pleased: 18 and this voice
we ourselves heard borne out of heaven, when we were with him
in the holy mount. </B>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;These verses illustrate the previous segment of text.  It is,
however, not the event which Peter takes as most significant (significant
though it was); but the voice of God!  It is God's address to
us that motivates and changes us.  Not what we hear he has done
to or for others.
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B> 19 And we have the word of prophecy made more sure; whereunto
ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a lamp shining in a dark
place, until the day dawn, and the day-star arise in your hearts:</B>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When daylight comes the lamp becomes unnecessary.  When God shines
in our hearts we will strive to serve Him out of love.  Light
will come from within and we will not have to rely on light from
without; or, to put it another way, we will serve God from wi!thin
and not because we fear external punishment if we do not serve
Him.
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B> 20 knowing this first, that no prophecy of scripture is of
private interpretation. 21 For no prophecy ever came by the will
of man: but men spake from God, being moved by the Holy Spirit.
</B>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Revelation is God's business.  God reveals Himself, we do not
find or discover Him.  The Scriptures are God's gift to us so
that we can know Him; we are called therefore to be grateful for
this gift.
<P>
<B>Chapter 2</B>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B>1 But there arose false prophets also among the people, as
among you also there shall be false teachers, who shall privily
bring in destructive heresies, denying even the Master that bought
them, bringing upon themselves swift destruction. 2 And many shall
follow their lascivious doings; by reason of whom the way of the
truth shall be evil spoken of. </B>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Church can have no fellowship with darkness.  Though this
is a truth that the Church early on in its history adopted, it
has been, in the present, virtually ignored.  In our day, the
day of accommodation, the Church is more like the world than ever
before.  Years ago Adolf von Harnack said that the greatest mistake
the Church made was to Hellenize itself.  What he meant was the
the church adopted the philosophical methods and presuppositions
of the Greek world -- and it became a part of culture instead of
God's witness in culture.  The same is true today.  When, however,
the Church returns to its roots it will have to make a choice
between the world and the Gospel.  It cannot serve God and cultural
ideas.
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B> 3 And in covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise
of you: whose sentence now from of old lingereth not, and their
destruction slumbereth not.</B>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Many can speak the Christian talk -- but this does not make them
Christian.  Cults often adopt the vocabulary of the Church in
order to lure more folks into their web.  
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B> 4 For if God spared not angels when they sinned, but cast
them down to hell, and committed them to pits of darkness, to
be reserved unto judgment; 5 and spared not the ancient world,
but preserved Noah with seven others, a preacher of righteousness,
when he brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly; 6 and turning
the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes condemned them with
an overthrow, having made them an example unto those that should
live ungodly; </B>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yes, if God punished the ancients, why is it that moderns think
they can escape?  How arrogant can people be?
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B> 7 and delivered righteous Lot, sore distressed by the lascivious
life of the wicked 8 !(for that righteous man dwelling among them,
in seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day
with their lawless deeds):</B>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The true Christian is greatly disturbed by the evils of the world;
effected to such an extent that they pray!  Nevertheless the bitterness
caused by sin in society weighs on them.  Their only solace is
God himself.
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B> 9 the Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptation,
and to keep the unrighteous under punishment unto the day of judgment; 10 but chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust
of defilement, and despise dominion. Daring, self-willed, they
tremble not to rail at dignities: 11 whereas angels, though greater
in might and power, bring not a railing judgment against them
before the Lord.</B>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Pure spirits know how important words are; and do not use them
lightly.  Fools, on the other hand, speak without thinking.
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B> 12 But these, as creatures without reason, born mere animals
to be taken and destroyed, railing in matters whereof they are
ignorant, shall in their destroying surely be destroyed,</B>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The reward of such a life of disobedience is slaughter.  Foolish
folk who rebel against God and His word are animal like in that
they are born only to die.  They speak of things they know nothing
about and thereby demonstrate their utter and complete senselessness.
 They shall be destroyed.  
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B> 13 suffering wrong as the hire of wrong-doing; men that count
it pleasure to revel in the day-time, spots and blemishes, revelling
in their deceivings while they feast with you; 14 having eyes
full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; enticing unstedfast
souls; having a heart exercised in covetousness; children of cursing;</B>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The flood of evil is only stopped by love for God; the
one who does not love God is flooded with sinfulness until they
are overtaken, drowned, in their own foolishness.
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B> 15 forsaking the right way, they went astray, having followed
the way of Balaam the son of Beor, who loved the hire of wrong-doing;
16 but he was rebuked for his own transgression: a dumb ass spake
with man's voice and stayed the madness of the prophet.</B>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;How great human arrogance is!  Yet when God wishes he can speak
to us out of the donkey's mouth.  That is, God speaks to us out
of those dumb beasts who act better than the ungodly do!  
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B> 17 These are springs without water, and mists driven by a
storm; for whom the blackness of darkness hath been reserved.</B>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They have fallen under God's judgment since they !have not accepted
God's grace.  They are useless and will suffer death and judgment.
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B> 18 For, uttering great swelling words of vanity, they entice
in the lusts of the flesh, by lasciviousness, those who are just
escaping from them that live in error;</B>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The heathen are without ethics.  They act without ethics and die
without ethics.  Why then, does the Church wish to accommodate
itself to such behavior and require nothing from such heathen
for membership within its walls?   Because the Church of today
is more interested in numbers than in quality.  It has adopted
salesmanship instead of truth as its standard; and it has sold
the Gospel for the pottage of Esau.  But God is no more pleased
with disobedience in the Church than outside it.
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B> 19 promising them liberty, while they themselves are bondservants
of corruption; for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he
also brought into bondage.</B>
<P>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Free to be what I want to be" is always the
first indication that the person saying such words has fallen
into evil.  We are free in Christ, from sin!  We are not free
to ignore God or do our own thing.  We are free to live in love
with God; not to live without him.
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B> 20 For if, after they have escaped the defilements of the
world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ,
they are again entangled therein and overcome, the last state
is become worse with them than the first. 21 For it were better
for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after
knowing it, to turn back from the holy commandment delivered unto
them. 22 It has happened unto them according to the true proverb,
The dog turning to his own vomit again, and the sow that had washed
to wallowing in the mire. </B>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When sin rules the he!art of a person, the end of their life is
destruction.  The one who falls into this trap falls hard and
deep.  So the task of the Church is not to accommodate itself
to such people but to boldly speak the Word of God to them so
that they may be delivered from their imminent destruction.
<P>
 
<P>
<B>Chapter 3</B>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B> 1 This is now, beloved, the second epistle that I write unto
you; and in both of them I stir up your sincere mind by putting
you in remembrance; 2 that ye should remember the words which
were spoken before by the holy prophets, and the commandments
of the Lord and Saviour through your apostles: </B>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Those who do not know Jesus cannot know what he means when he
says he says what he says.  They cannot be obedient and they cannot
hear.  They cannot see.  Without Him, they cannot comprehend anything
of a spiritual or eternal nature.  Only those who are his sheep
hear his voice.  
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B> 3 knowing this first, that in the last days mockers shall
come with mockery, walking after their own lusts, 4 and saying,
Where is the promise of his coming? for, from the day that the
fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the
beginning of the creation.</B>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yet, even in the membership of the Church, there are people who
laugh at the promise of God.  Moreover the one who knows Jesus
and who is obedient to the will of God finds no place in his or
her heart to deride the promise which Jesus has made to return.
 The promise of Jesus is ever new and ever in the process of fulfillment.
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B> 5 For this they willfully forget, that there were heavens
from of old, and an earth compacted out of water and amidst water,
by the word of God; 6 by which means the world that then was,
being overflowed with water, perished: 7 but the heavens
that now are, and the earth, by the same word have been stored
up for fire, being reserved against the day of judgment and destruction
of ungodly men.</B>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The world is not greater than God, and is still subject to his
judgment.  It cannot escape, even if it ignores him and acts as
though he does not exist.
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B> 8 But forget not this one thing, beloved, that one day is
with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one
day. </B>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Be patient and wait -- for God is not forgetful nor ignorant of
His promises.  What appears to us long or short does not appear
so to God.  Time is our venue, not God's.  Reckoning with time
has to do with us and not with God.
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B> 9 The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some count
slackness; but is longsuffering to you-ward, not wishing that
any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.</B>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We lament that God has forgotten us and his promise but the fulfillment
of the promise is God's own work and will be done in God's own
way and time.  His judgment is sure and his rewards are certain.
  
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B> 10 But the day of the Lord will come as a thief; in the which
the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements
shall be dissolved with fervent heat, and the earth and the works
that are therein shall be burned up. </B>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The day will come; but not according to our time tables; it will
come when God wishes it.  
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B> 11 Seeing that these things are thus all to be dissolved,
what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy living and godliness,
12 looking for and earnestly desiring the coming of the day of
God, by reason of which the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved,
and the elements shall melt with fervent heat? 13 But, according
to his promise, we look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein
dwelleth righteousness.</B>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What will remain when the world comes to an end?  The people of
God!  For us comes salvation and eternal life.  For us comes blessedness.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But why are a new heaven and a new earth necessary?  Because
we have so totally corrupted God's good creation that He is simply
going to start over again; and when He does, this time people
will not rebel, for we will know better.  The unrighteous and
unbelieving will not be there to corrupt or to mislead.  All will
stand before God as they should have all along.  
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B> 14 Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for these things,
give diligence that ye may be found in peace, without spot and
blameless in his sight. 15 And account that the longsuffering
of our Lord is salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also,
according to the wisdom given to him, wrote unto you;</B>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A living hope is given us.  We live for a purpose; and that purpose
is to glorify God.  
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B> 16 as also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these
things; wherein are some things hard to be understood, which the
ignorant and unstedfast wrest, as they do also the other scriptures,
unto their own destruction.</B>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;People falsify the words of the apostles because of sin.  And
when they do not read the words of the apostles they naturally
cannot do them!  Reading brings about understanding and understanding
brings about obedience.  One cannot obey if one does not know.
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<B> 17 Ye therefore, beloved, knowing these things beforehand,
beware lest, being carried away with the error of the wicked,
ye fall from your own stedfastness. 18 But grow in the grace
and knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be
the glory both now and for ever. Amen. </B>
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Grace and peace are what the people of God can expect from the
future.  What else is needed?
