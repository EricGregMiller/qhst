<B>L427 Biblical Textual Criticism: The New Testament</B> 
<P>
<B>Purpose:</B>  To introduce the student to the theory and practice of
the textual criticism of the New Testament.  Textual
criticism is the science which seeks to establish the text which
most closely resembles the original text of a document.  In particular,
New Testament text criticism attempts to assemble and evaluate
the various readings of the Greek text in order to come as close
as possible to what was originally written. 
<P>
In addition, text criticism also seeks to understand the history and transmission of the text.
<P>
<B>Course Requirements:</B> To accomplish the above mentioned goal the
student will be required to read sections of the textbooks listed
below and various portions of the New Testament as well
as the lectures attached to this syllabus.  Then the student will
be required to answer, in essay form, the questions found at the
end of the lectures.
