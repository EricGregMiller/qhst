<B>H372 - The Reformation in Germany: Martin Luther</B>
<P>
<B>ASSIGNMENT:</B>  Read Kurt Aland's &quot;History of Christianity&quot;,
Vol 2, chapters 1-2.
<P>
 The end of the Middle Ages and the dawn of the Renaissance was
perhaps the most trying period of human history.  The world was
moving from childhood to adulthood -- and the growing pains were
terrible to behold.
<P>
 The old order was passing and the new was rising.  The Church
of Rome was expanding and building in order to maintain its power
and appearance.  And perhaps the most striking thing about the
entire period was its fascination with appearance.  In fact, that
fascination with appearance has remained in western culture till
this very day.
<P>
 The protests of Wycliffe and Hus against the wealth of the Church
and its misuse had not been very effective; for the Church continued
to expend its resources not on people but on things, like buildings.
 St. Peter's Basilica in Rome was built during the lifetime of
Luther; and it was the catalyst for Luther's reaction.  But how
so?  Rome needed money in order to build St. Peter's, and in order
to raise money the Pope authorized the sale of indulgences.
<P>
 By purchasing an indulgence one could assure that either oneself
or a loved one were spared a long stay in Purgatory.  Rome made
bundles of money by the sale of these indulgences -- most from
Germany.
<P>
 At the same time, Luther came to realize that salvation did not
depend on works but on grace; and with this realization he boldly
attacked the economic basis of the Roman Church because he did
not want to see his beloved countrymen robbed of their property
for a religious action of no avail -- so that it is fair to say
that the Reformation came about because of both spiritual and
economic factors.
<P>
 Luther was, without a doubt, the most significant of the Reformers.
 Born on Nov. 10, 1483 at Eisleben, and frightened as a young
man in a storm, he joined the Augustinian movement at Erfurt and
lived there for a brief time.   He studied theology after his
novitiate and accepted the theological perspective of his day.
 He believed at that time that salvation was accomplished by the
grace of God, along with human merit for good deeds.  Or, in other
words, salvation comes about because of faith plus works.  
<P>
 In 1505 the turning point in Luther's life took place.  He became
incredibly interested in the Bible.  This interest grew over a
period of many years and later came to fruition.  Luther journeyed
to Rome in 1510 on business for the order, and was disappointed
by the great luxury which he saw among the cardinals.  In 1511
Luther was sent by his superior to Wittenberg to be the professor
of Biblical Theology.  Before he could assume this duty he was
required to obtain a doctorate in theology, which he accomplished
in 1512.  He then assumed his duties as lecturer at the university
of Wittenberg, where he would remain the rest of his life.
<P>
 In 1514 Luther was appointed preacher of the city Church in Wittenberg.
 Thus, he combined the pulpit and the podium in his ministerial
duties.  
<P>
 As Luther continued to lecture on the Biblical text, he became
more certain that salvation was by grace alone.  His lectures
on Psalms, Romans, Galatians and Hebrews show that this confidence
in grace was growing slowly but surely.  Especially in his lectures
of 1516-1517 on Galatians can one see his growing love of grace
and disdain of merits accomplished by human effort or bought in
an indulgence sale.
<P>
 By the time Luther lectured on Romans, he had completely repudiated
the idea of merit as earned grace.  It seems clear then that Luther
did not come to his understanding &quot;all of a sudden&quot;;
but that the development of his theology took place over a period
of many years.
<P>
 The consequences of  this change in theological perspective were
far reaching. 
<P>
The popular understanding of salvation was undermined; and the
power of the papacy was threatened.  Rome had no choice but to
respond.
<P>
 The matter with Luther came to a head in 1517 when Luther sent
letters to his superiors asking them to repeal the indulgence
sale; and along with the letter a series of 95 theses which supported
his request.  These theses were spread all around the country
and they ignited a fire of protest against the economic and spiritual
misdeeds of Rome. 
<P>
In 1519 Luther was summoned to Leipzig in order to defend his
views or recant them. 
<P>
He presented his case with vigor -- and the Reformation was born
in Germany.
<P>
 As the Reform movement grew, the ideas of Luther were spread
around Germany; and beyond.  At the University of Wittenberg the
reigning scholastic theology was replaced by Biblical languages
and studies in 1518.  In 1520 Luther wrote his three most significant
works:  &quot;Sermon on Good Works&quot;, &quot;Babylonian Captivity
of the Church&quot; and &quot;The Freedom of a Christian&quot;.
 These works set forth the ideas that 1) Christian ethics arise
from faith; 2) there are only two sacraments, the Eucharist and
Baptism; and 3) freedom means responsibility.  These ideas served
as the foundation stones of all later Lutheran thought, and their
influence can be felt to the present day.
<P>
 The Roman Church was not sitting on its hands during this period
of uproar.  In 1520 Luther received notice that if he did not
recant he would be excommunicated. 
<P>
Luther, of course, refused, and was excommunicated in 1521.  He
was then summoned to the Diet of Worms (pronounced &quot;dee-ut&quot;
of &quot;vurms&quot;; not that he ate a diet of worms!!) where
he was offered one more opportunity to recant.  He refused and
in order to avoid capture was taken to the castle at Wartburg
for several years.
<P>
 While at the castle Luther translated the New Testament into
German and published it in 1522.  (By 1534 he had translated the
entire Bible).
<P>
Unfortunately, Luther's adherents in Wittenberg could not maintain
his leadership in his absence and the seeds of the &quot;radical
reformation&quot; were planted which would later blossom in the
bloody horror of the peasants revolt.  When Luther returned to
Wittenberg, he again took the reins of the reform and returned
it to its Biblical track.  He died in 1546, in the very town in
which he was born.
<P>
 For the remainder of his life, Luther vigorously pressed his
views into the public eye.  But nothing new was accomplished after
1520.  By that time the egg had been laid and it was only a matter
of warming it until it hatched.
<P>
 But what exactly was born of Luther's reform?  It is certain
that Luther returned to the Biblical concept of faith -- but did
he throw the baby out with the bath water?  After all, one of
the most devastating effects of the Reformation was a withering
of piety (which the Pietists and Pilgrims would later rediscover).
 Luther's reform was excellent for the intellectual elite -- but
for the peasants, who did not and could not comprehend the theological
subtleties which were the foundation of Luther's thought.  The
peasants saw only an opportunity for license and laziness -- now
they were free to pursue their own interests instead of the interests
of the Church and therefore of God.
<P>
 The ultimate result of Luther's reform was that the Church was
plunged into a never ending strife: religious wars and witch hunts.
 Dogma replaced love as the litmus test of Christianity, and a
new gnosticism was born which placed knowledge above action.
<P>
 Huldrych Zwingli's reform was far more balanced; and if it had
gained the popularity which Luther's did, then the Church would
have been able to retain its significance into the modern age.
 It is to Zwingli that we now turn.
