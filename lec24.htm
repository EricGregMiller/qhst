<B>Persia</B>
<P>
 The first mention we have of the Persians is on a tablet recording
the expedition of Shalmanesser III into a country called Parsua,
in the mountains of Kurdistan around 837 BC.  There, it seems
that twenty-seven chieftain-kings ruled over twenty-seven states
thinly populated by a people called Amadai, Madai, or Medes. 
They were Indo-European and had probably come from around the
Caspian Sea into Western Asia about 1000 BC.  The Zend-Avesta,
the sacred scriptures of the Persains, idealized the racial memory
of their ancient homeland and described it as a paradise.  Not
likely, since if it was so nice, why would they have ever left?
 In any case, scenes of our youth and the past are often wonderful
and pleasant -- if we don't have to live in them again.
<P>
 The Persians seem to have wandered south until they reached Persia.
 At Ecbatana &quot;a meeting place of many ways&quot;, which is
located in a picturesque valley made fertile by the melting snows
of the highlands, Deioces (also their first recorded king) founded
their first capital.  It was dominated by his royal palace which
covered an area of nearly a square mile.  Royalty has always gone
in for the grandiose and resplendant.
<P>
 According to a passage in Herodotus, Deioces achieved power by
acquiring a reputation for justice.  Unfortunately, once he got
the position, he turned into a despot.  But, that's the way of
politics: promise the moon, and then when you get what you want,
do whatever you darn well please.
<P>
 Deioces issued a decree, that &quot;no man should be admitted
to the King's presence, but everyone should consult him by means
of messengers; moreover, that it should be accounted indecency
for any one to laugh or spit before him.  He established such
ceremony about his person for this reason,...that he might appear
to be a different nature to them who did not see him.&quot;  So
wrote Herodotus.
<P>
 Under the leadership of Deioces, the Medes became a threat to
the power of Assyria, so the Assyrians repeatedly invaded him.
 Each time, they imagined the Medes subdued, only to be surprised
by their persistance in rebelling and fighting.
<P>
 The greatest of the Median kings was one Cyaxares, and he finally
demonstrated to the Assyrians their mistake in imagining the Medes
were subdued: he invaded Assyria and destroyed its capital Ninevah.
 Thus, the Assyrian empire was ended.  
<P>
 Inspired by his victory, Cyaxares swept though western Asia to
the very gates of Sardis, only to be turned back by an eclipse
of the sun.  Cyaxares was on the superstitious side.  However,
Cyaxares' enemies were equally superstious, and taking the eclipse
as a warning from the sky, they quickly signed a peace treaty
and sealed it by drinking one another's blood.
<P>
 Cyaxares died the next year, having, during the course of his
reign, expanded his kingdom from a subject province into an empire
embracing Assyria, Media, and Persia.  As is the nature of empires,
his creation was unstable, and within a generation of his death,
it had fallen apart.  Thus, the tenure of this Median Empire was
too brief to lead to much in the way of contribution to the civilization
of the world, except in that it prepared or laid the ground work
for the culture of Persia.
<P>
 To Persia, the Medes did give something: their Aryan language,
their alphabet of thirty-six characters, their replacement of
clay with parchment and the use of a pen as a writing tool; the
Medes also gave the Persians the use of the column in architecture,
their Zoroastrian religion of Ahura-Mazda (which had nothing at
all to do with later Japanese auto manufacturers), and Ahriman.
 They also gave them their patriarchal family structure and polygamous
marriages.
<P>
 In any case, the degeneration of the Medes proceded much more
quickly than their rise.  Astyages, the successor of Cyaxares,
proved once again that monarchy is a crapshoot (cf. Ecclesiastes
2:18-19: &quot;I hated all the things I had toiled for under the
sun, because I must leave them to the one who comes after me,
and who knows whether he will be a wise man or a fool?&quot;).
 Astyages inherited the kingdom cheerfully, and settled down to
enjoy it.  His behavior, and that of his countrymen, was not unlike
so often happens to those who gain riches to quickly and too easily.
 The stern and stoic philosophy of their forebears was forgotten;
the upper classes became slaves of fashion and luxury; the men
wore embroidered pants, the women covered themselves with cosmetics
and jewlry, and even the horses were decked with gold.  A formerly
pastoral people, who had been glad to be borne by crude wagons,
now rode in expensive chariots from party to party.
<P>
 While the early kings of the Medes had prided themselves on justice,
Astyages was of another mind.  Being displeased with an individual
by the name of Harpagus (so the story goes), Astyages served up
the dismemebered and headless body of his own son and forced him
to eat it.  Harpagus ate, commenting that whatever the king did
was agreeable to him.
<P>
 Unsurprisingly, Harpagus harbored a bit of a grudge and was instrumental
in helping Cyrus later depose Astyages.  In fact, when Cyrus,
who had come from the Median dependancy of Ansham, in Persia,
rebelled against Astyages (c. 549 BC), the Medes welcomed Cyrus'
victory and accepted him, almost without protest, as their new
king.
<P>
 Thus, in a single engagement, Media ceased to be the master of
Persia, and Persia became the master of Media; soon, it would
become the master of the entire Near Eastern world, as well.
<P>
 An alliance was formed against Cyrus by Croesus, the king of
Lydia (which is in Asia minor.  Croesus is significant, if for
no other reason than the fact that he is credited with the invention
of coinage), Nabonidus of Babylon, and Amasis, the Pharoah of
Egypt (569-525 BC).  So, in 546 Cyrus attacked the forces of Croesus
and defeated him, thus gaining control of the whole of Asia Minor
(modern day Turkey).  His next thrust was at Babylon itself, and
the Cyrus Cylinder records the way he believed (or at least this
is what he told the Babylonians) that Marduk, the patron deity
of Babylon, assisted his subsequent victory:
<P>
 <blockquote>Marduk...to his city Babylon he caused [Cyrus] to go, he made
him take the road to Babylon, going as a friend and companion
at his side...without battle and conflict he permitted him to
enter Babylon.  He spared his city Babylon a calamity....</blockquote>
<P>
 Cyrus is said to have diverted the course of the Euphrates River
during his assault of Babylon.  Since the river passed under the
city walls and through the city, when the water was diverted,
his army was able to enter the city easily by simply walking along
the now dry riverbed.  Thus, Babylon fell to Cyrus about 538 BC.
<P>
 With the conquest of Babylon, Cyrus became the ruler of the largest
empire the world had known till that time.  During the reign of
his jerk of a son, the influence of Persia would extend all the
way to Egypt as well.
<P>
 Under Cyrus, the fall of Babylon was an answer to prayer and
prophecy.  It would signal the beginning of their restoration
to the promissed land.
<P>
 The first principle of Cyrus' policy was that the various people
of his empire should be left free in their religious worshi and
beliefs.  Cyrus was one of the first rulers to recognize a basic
principle of statesmanship: religion is stronger than the state.

<P>
 Instead of sacking cities and wrecking temples, he showed a courteous
respect for the deities of the conquered and contributed to the
maintance of their shrines.  This is seen in the wording of his
decree to the Jewish people in permitting them to return to their
land.  His positive statements about Yahweh and the Jews, should
thus be taken in the context of his attitude toward other deities,
rather than being taken as proof that he had become a convert
to Judaism.
<P>
 Cyrus died of ambition.  He was killed in a battle with Massagetae,
an obscure tribe that peopled the southern shores of the Caspian
Sea.  His son, the jerk, was called Cambyses.  He was half crazy.
 He took the throne upon his father's untimely demise, and immediately
put to death his own brother and potential rival, Smerdis.  Attracted
to the wealth of Egypt like a moth to a flame, he captured Memphis
easily enough, but an army of fifty thousand Persians sent to
anex the Oasis of Amon was lost in the desert without a trace.
 An expedition to Carthage failed because the Phoenician crews
that manned the Persian fleet refused to attack a Phoenician city.
 Duh!
<P>
 Next, Cambyses publically scoffed at the Egyptian religion, plunged
a dagger into the bull revered by the Egyptians as the god Apis,
exhumed mummies, and pried into royal tombs, heedless of ancient
curses.  He profaned temples and ordered idols burned.  He thought
that by doing these things he would succeed in freeing the Egyptians
of their superstitions.  Unfortunately, he was stricken ill --
apparently epileptic seizures -- and the Egyptians became convinced
that it was the gods themselves punishing him.
<P>
 To demonstrate beyond question his questionable grip on reality,
Cambyses killed his wife (and sister) Roxana with a kick in the
stomach.  He dispatched his son Prexaspes with an arrow.  Twelve
Persians of noble birth he burried alive.  And then he condemned
Croesus, king of Lydia, to death.  A little while later, he changed
his mind, and rejoiced at the news that the execution had not
yet been carried out.  To celebrate, he punished the officers
who had delayed in executing the Lydian king.
<P>
 On his way back to Persia from Egypt, he learned that an usurper
had taken the throne, supported by a massive revolution.  Nothing
more is heard of Cambyses, though the rumor is, he committed suicide.
 In any case, everyone was just glad he was gone.
<P>
 The usurper had pretended to be Cambyses, though in reality he
was a religious fanatic bent on destroying Zoroastrianism, the
official religion of Persia.  This idea did not go over well,
and so another revolution soon got rid of him.  The seven aristocrats
who had organized this rebellion raised one of their own to the
throne.  His name was Darius, he was the son of Hystaspes.  It
should be noted that this is not the Darius mentioned in the book
of Daniel.
<P>
 Darius' succession to the throne was marked by uprisings in the
various subject regions, as is always the case when an empire
shifts hands.  Thus, the governors of Egypt and Lydia refused
submission, and the provinces of Susiana, Babylonia, Media, Assyria,
Armenia, Sacia, and others rose in simultaneous revolt.
<P>
 Darius, needless to say, suddenly had his hands full.  Amazingly,
he managed to prevail.  
<P>
 Taking Babylon after a long seize he crucified three thousand
of its leading citizens as an inducement to the rest that obedience
was a wise choice.  In a series of swift campaigns, he pacified
one rebellious region after another.
<P>
 With the empire whole again, and this lesson firmly in mind,
that vast empires in crisis could quickly fall to pieces, he put
asside the battle gear and became one of the wisest administrators
in history, seeking a way to bind the empire together so that
it would not so easily fall apart in the future.  What he did
became a model of imperial organization.  The result was a generation
of peace, order and prosperity that western asia had never known
before.
<P>
 Still, all was not conflict free.  The Scythians kept invading
distant regions of his empire from the north, necessitating action
on his part.  So he marched his army into southern Russia, across
the Bosphorus and the Danube, all the way to the Volga.  He marched
across Afganistan and into Indus Valley.  Thus, he added millions
of people and vast wealth to his empire.
<P>
<B>Greece.</B>  Herodotus, the Greek historian, would have us
believe that Darius entered upon his war with Greece -- what ended
up being his greatest mistake -- because one of his wives, Atossa,
teased him into it while they were in bed.  It seemse more likely
that he simply saw the Greek city states and their colonies as
a potential danger to him, should they ever manage to unite. 
Thus, when Ionia revoltd and received aid from Sparta and Athens,
Darius went to war.
<P>
 Darius was defeated at the battle of Marathon and returned gloomily
to Persia.  There, amidst preparations for a second war against
Greece, he suddenly weakened and died.
<P>
<B>Languages of Persia.</B>  Many languages have been used in
the long history of Persia.  The speech of the court and nobility
in the days of Darius I was Old Persian, a tongue so closely related
to Sanskrit that evidently they are both dialects of some language
older still.
<P>
 Old Persian developed on the one hand into Zend, the language
of the Zend-Avesta and on the other hand into Pahlavi -- a Hindu
language from which has come the Persian language of today, Farsi
(spoken in modern Iran).
<P>
 When the Persians took to writing, they adopted the Babylonian
cuneiform for their monumental inscriptions and the Aramaic alphabet
for their other documents.
<P>
 They proceeded to symplify the unwieldy syllabary of the Babylonians
from six hundred plus characters down to thirty-six signs which
gradually became letters instead of syllables, thus becoming a
cuneiform alphabet.
<P>
 We are able to read Babylonian and the earlier Sumerian today
because of the Persians.  Had they not used Babylonian cuneiform
to write their inscriptions, together with the same inscription
in Aramaic script, we would never have been able to decipher the
older writings.

 English is related to the Persian and Sanskrit languages, as
