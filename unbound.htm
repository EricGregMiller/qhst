 Dr. John Sailhamer's 1996 book, <I>Genesis Unbound: A Provocative
New Look at the Creation Account</I> (Multnomah) is 250 pages
of worthwhile reading.  The book is laid out in four parts: 1-
Genesis in Controversy, lays the groundwork by discussing the
modern fissure between faith and science and raises the questions
which will be answered in the forthcoming sections.  Part 2, <I>Genesis
Reconsidered</I>, discusses the Biblical chronology as described
in Genesis 1-2.  Sailhamer calls it the &quot;heart of the book&quot;
which he hopes will enable us to live in peace, as believers,
with science.  Part 3  is a brief exposition of Genesis 1:1-2:4a
(what was once denominated the &quot;Priestly Account&quot; of
creation by scholars of a bygone day).  Part 4 is a brief discussion
of the function of one's world-view in the interpretation of Scripture
and how one must be aware of that world-view to avoid a skewed
reading.  The book concludes with an epilogue and notes.  There
are, scattered throughout the book, various &quot;sidebars&quot;.
 The book is well-bound and though paperback, seems to be well
constructed.
<P>
 The basic premise of the book, I think, can be summarized in
one sentence:  Science and a correct reading of Genesis 1:1-2:4a
are not contradictory but complementary.  Sailhamer suggests that
the word &quot;beginning&quot; in Genesis 1:1 holds within itself
the key to a correct reading of the text.  The word can be understood
to refer to the boundless (or not) ages before God &quot;prepared&quot;
the Earth for human habitation (as described in Genesis 1:2-2:4a).
 Thus the dinosaurs, ice ages, and geological strata can be traced
to this &quot;beginning&quot; while the presence of humankind
on the earth takes place only after this extended period of &quot;beginning&quot;.
 Thus, Sailhamer would suggest, science can rightly deal with
this &quot;beginning&quot; period without fearing that faith will
be contradicted because it is only with the creation of man and
God's preparation of the earth for human habitation that concerns
the author of Genesis 1:2-2:4a (taken by Sailhamer to be Moses).
<P>
 The whole of Sailhamer's argument seems to hinge on a couple
of premises:  1- that science and faith need to be reconciled,
and 2- that his interpretation of &quot;beginning&quot; in Genesis
1:1 can achieve this reconciliation.
<P>
 As to the first premise the natural question arises: why do science
and faith need to be reconciled?  This apologetic molief that
Genesis is history and not theology (or as the Germans put it,
<I>Historie</I> and not <I>Geschichte</I>).  This premise is questionable
at best.  The notion that the Biblical writers were interested
in history seems doubtful.  They were interested, as Sailhamer
rightly notes, in how God came to prepare a wonderful world for
human habitation.  This is a theological question, however, and
not a historical one.  Using Genesis as history (or <I>Historie</I>)
instead of reading it theologically is like using the Bible as
a mathematics text or a music theory text or a civics text.  Though
the Bible contains music and civics, it is surely not about those
things- it is about God and His relationship to humankind.  I
would suggest, then, that there is no need to reconcile the Bible
and science because they are about two totally different subjects.
 They need no more be reconciled than apples and oranges.
<P>
 As to Sailhamer's second premise, that &quot;beginning&quot;
means an extended period of time (or not), I can simply say that
in normal use the Hebrew word simply cannot bear such a &quot;timeless&quot;
interpretation.  The word <I>bereshit</I> -- beginning --
occurs 5 times in the Hebrew Bible; here at Gen 1:1, Jer 26:1,
Jer 27:1, Jer 28:1, and Jer 49:34.  When one looks at how the
word is used in Jeremiah, one discovers that it means simply &quot;at
the start&quot;.  I.e., at the start of Jehoiakim's reign, etc.
 This points to a definite time and place, and not to an indefinite
period which stretched out over millennia!  To adopt Sailhamer's
reading we would have to conclude that the beginning of Jehoiakim's
reign lasted a very long time.  This is logically erroneous and
unnecessary.  How, after all, can the beginning point of anything
be extended into infinity?  The beginning point of a line is just
that, a point.  Normal usage should prevail when one interprets
a word.  
<P>
 If one overlooks these presuppostional errors on the part of
Sailhamer, then one can benefit a great deal from his work.  If
one must have a well laid foundation of demonstrable presuppositions,
then one may well enjoy this book very much; but will have a nagging
question throughout the reading.
<P>
 These criticisms aside, this is a very readable and enjoyable
text.  It is pleasant to see a gifted author set forth his ideas
clearly (even if one cannot adopt his presuppositions!).  This
book deserves to be read; and it deserves to be thought through!
