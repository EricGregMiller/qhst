<b>SELECTED TESTAMENTS</b>
<P>
 The testamentary literature found among the Old Testament Pseudepigrapha
serve, on the whole, the simple function of encouraging the hearer
and reader.  In brief, these documents are hortatory sermons aimed
at helping those who are the &quot;spiritual heirs&quot; of the
patriarch (for these testaments generally stem from someone writing
in the name of a famous patriarch like Judah or Abraham or Adam).
 These testaments purport to be just what their name implies-
a &quot;last will and testament&quot; and thus are read as such
by both their ancient and modern purveyors.
<P>
 These testaments were written in a variety of languages and translated
into such languages as Syriac, Ethiopic, Greek and Latin.  They
differ from the Apocalypses we have already discussed in that
they are not veiled in allegorical language.  They are simple
sermons.
