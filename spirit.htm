&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Quartz Hill School of Theology believes that because of its high
view of the inspiration of the Scriptures and of the person and
work of Jesus Christ, there should be an equally high level of
practical Christian living. Too often the ministry today manifests
the spirit of modern business. Its policies are sometimes guided
more by self-interest, self-advancement, money, and numbers, than
by the Holy Spirit. Deploring this trend, Quartz Hill School of Theology is placing a strong
emphasis upon the center of Christian theology: love of God and love of neighbor.  As Jesus said, on these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets (Matthew 22:36-40; cf. Mark 12:28-33, Romans 13:9-10 and Galatians 5:14).
The school believes that the church is a family, a supernatural,
Spirit-powered organism, not a business. Quartz Hill School of Theology stresses the logical
necessity for its faculty, staff, and students to live a consistent
Christian life.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Quartz Hill School of Theology seeks to lead its student body
into a positive, dedicated, Spirit-filled life. It believes that
Christians should not merely ask what they must give up for Christ,
but what they can do for him. It therefore lays stress upon private
devotion, prayer, witnessing, and wholehearted cooperation with
other Christian workers.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;QHST believes that students are greatly benefited by undertaking
various Christian service activities during the period of their
training and expects each student to be actively engaged in some
specific form of practical ministry.
