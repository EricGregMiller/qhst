<CENTER><B><H1>Israel's Sojourn in Egypt</H1></B></CENTER> 
<P>
The patriarchs' quiet pastoral life in Canaan came to an end in
the circumstances that followed the sale of Joseph to the Ismaelites
and his subsequent exaltation in Egypt. According to the biblical
chronology (of the MT), Jacob and his family would appear to have
emigrated to Egypt sometime around 1871 BC during the 12th dynasty
(the Middle Kingdom). Their emigration was sparked by Joseph's
position of authority combined with a severe famine in Canaan.
<P>
Abraham had visited Egypt during an earlier period of the Middle
Kingdom. This also had happened during a famine (Genesis 12:10-20).
Trade was common between Asia and Egypt during this entire period.
The Ismaelites who had sold Joseph into Egypt were described as
&quot;a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead. Their camels
were loaded with spices, balm and myrrh, and they were on their
way to take them down to Egypt&quot; (Gen. 37:25). In addition
to uncoined silver which was used as a medium of exchange (coinage
wouldn't be invented for another thousand years or so), Jacob's
sons later brought produce as items of trade to get food from
Egypt (see Genesis 43:11-12).
<P>
Outside the Bible there is clear evidence for this sort of trade
with asiatics. For instance, there is a nice sculpture at Beni
Hasan from around 1900 BC that illustrates trade with Semites.
It is on a tomb belonging to an Egyptian official named Khnumhotep,
who had served under Senwosret II. The inscription accompanying
the image describes the picture as a portrayal of &quot;the arrival
of thirty-seven asiatics bringing eye paint to Khnumhotep.&quot;
The leader of these thirty-seven traders is described as &quot;Ibshe,
Sheik of the highlands&quot;; this is clearly a Semitic designation.
<P>
<B>Evidences of Israel's Sojourn in Egypt</B> 
<P>
Despite attempts by some of the more radical critics to deny that
the Jewish people ever spent time in Egypt, most scholars are
comfortable with the idea that the Isaelites did come from there,
though there is sharp disagreement over exactly what that time
was like, when it was, and exactly how it was that they ended
up leaving Egypt.
<P>
The biblical picture of things is difficult to discount, however,
because the captivity and subsequent Exodus form the foundation
of Israelite society as portrayed by the Bible; theologically
it is the demonstration and basis for the concept of salvation.
If God is able to save physically from Egyptian servitude, then
he as able to save spiritually from servitude to sin.
<P>
So what is the extrabiblical evidence of the Jewish captivity
in Egypt?
<P>
<I><B>Egyptian Personal Names of the Levites</B></I> 
<P>
Perhaps the most difficult to explain bit of evidence, if one
should choose to deny that Israel actually spent time in Egypt,
is the presence of a surprisingly large number of Egyptian personal
names in the genealogies of the Levites. Some significant examples
would be: Moses, Assir, Pashhur, Hophni, Phenehas, and Merari.
<P>
Most critical scholars grant that the proportion of Egyptian names
among the Levites is surprisingly large and could scarcely be
accidental. Accordingly, they are ready to agree that the tribe
of Levi, or at least part of it, spent some time in Egypt. Other
scholars point out that since the Egyptian names seem to be confined
to Levites, then perhaps they are the only tribe that really lived
in Egypt. Of course, arguments from silence are notoriously weak.
<P>
<I><B>Authentic Egyptian Details</B></I> 
<P>
The details of life in Egypt as found in Genesis and then in Exodus
are accurate and of a nature that make the stories consistent
with a real captivity. That is, if the Israelites did not spend
time in Egypt, it is unclear how the author of Genesis and Exodus
would have known enough to so accurately describe Egyptian details
and customs. For instance, in the Joseph narrative, when the author
mentions the titles of the Egyptian officials, he employs the
correct title in use and exactly as it was used in the period
referred to. In fact, in those places where there is no equivalent
Hebrew word, he simply transliterates the Egyptian term. For instance,
the &quot;chief of the butlers&quot; and the &quot;chief of the
bakers&quot; (Genesis 40:2) are palace officials that are mentioned
in Egyptian texts.
<P>
When Potiphar makes Joseph &quot;overseer over his house&quot;
(Genesis 39:4), the title employed is a direct translation of
an official position in the houses of Egyptian nobility. In Genesis
41:40 Pharoah elevates Joseph to a high position, which corresponds
precisely to the office of prime minister or vizier of Egypt,
who was the chief administrator in the country, second in power
to Pharaoh himself. Also, the list of gifts that Joseph got from
Pharoah when he took office correspond to what we know of Egyptian
custom (see Genesis 41:42-43).
<P>
Other instances of authentic local color in the story of Joseph
are numerous. There is, for example, ample evidence of famines
in Egypt (cf. Gen. 41). At least two Egyptian officials, giving
a synopsis of their good deeds on the walls of their tombs, list
dispensing food to the needy &quot;in each year of want.&quot;
One inscription written about 100 BC actually tells of a seven-year
famine in the days of Pharaoh Zoser of the Third Dynasty (c. 3200
BC).
<P>
The narrative of Joseph is paralleled to a very limited degree
by the Egyptian story of the Two Brothers, Anubis and Bitis. This
romance is contained in the Papyrus d'Orbiney, and the episode
with which the story begins, the attempted seduction of Bitis
by his brother's wife, bears a superficial resemblance to the
story of Joseph and Potiphar's wife. Both Bitis and Joseph resist
the temptation, suffer ignominy, and in the case of Bitis, physical
mutilation. The rest of the story, nevertheless bears some faint
resemblance to the story of Joseph's life. The tale belongs to
the period of Seti II, near the close of the 13th century -- long
after the time of Joseph.
<P>
Dreams were regarded by Egyptians as extremely important, as in
the Biblical narrative. The monuments also indicate that magicians
played an important role in Egyptian affairs (cf. Gen. 41:8),
that Asiatic shepherds were indeed &quot;an abomination to the
Egyptians&quot; (Gen. 43:32; 46:34), that Joseph's life span of
110 years (Gen. 50:22) was the traditional length of a happy and
prosperous life in Egypt and that the mummification of Jacob and
Jsoseph (Gen. 50:2, 26) was according to Egyptian practice in
preparing the bodies of distinguished people for burial.
<P>
The family of Jcaob, seventy in number (Gen. 46:26, 27), settled
in Egypt in the land of Goshen (Gen. 46:26-34), identified with
the area around the Wadi Tumilat in the eastern part of the delta
of the Nile. This narrow valley, about thirty-five miles in length
joins the Nile River with Lake Timsah. In both ancient and modern
times the area around this Wadi, especially to the north of it,
was one of the richest parts of Egypt, &quot;the best of the land&quot;
(Gen. 47:11). Besides the piece of sculpture showing the entrance
of the family of Ibshe into Egypt about 1900 BC, another Egyptian
inscription indicates that it was customary ofor frontier officals
to allow people from Palestine and Sinai to enter this section
of Egypt in periods of drought. Dating about 1350 BC, this document
is written from frontier officials to the Pharaoh, telling him
such a group &quot;who knew not how they should live, have come
begging a home in the domain of Pharaoh..., after the manner of
your [the Pharaoh's] father's fathers since the beginning....&quot;
<P>
<I><B>Canaanite Place Names in the Bible</B></I> 
<P>
A long Semitic occupation of the northeastern Delta before the
New Egyptian Empire (1546-1085 BC) is certain from the Canaanite
place names found there in the the New Empire, which included
Succoth (Ex. 12:37), Baal-zephon (Ex. 14:2), Migdol (Ex. 14:2),
Zilu (Tell Abu Seifah) and very likely Goshen itself (Ex. 8:22;
9:26).
<P>
<I><B>Israel and the Hyksos</B></I> 
<P>
According to the Biblical chronology, the story of Joseph should
be placed around 1871 BC, during the 12th Dynasty.
<P>
However, many scholars like to place his rise to power during
the time of the Hyksos, about 1700 BC, under the supposition that
it would be a historical misinterpretation to imagine that a young
Semitic foreigner would have been elevated to such power under
native Egyptian dynasties like the 12th or late 18th. These scholars
see in Exodus 1:8 a reference to one of the Pharaohs of the New
Empire, after the Hyksos (the hated Asiatics), were thrown out.
<P>
I would argue, however, that the Pharoah who knew not Joseph might
actually be a reference to the incoming Hyksos ruler, a foreigner.
However, since the Bible does not give us the name of a Pharaoh,
and since there are no unabiguous historical references, it is
difficulty, in my estimation, to be overly certain or dogmatic
about the dating of Joseph, or, for that matter, of the Exodus
event itself.
<P>
<B>Moses: The Deliverer</B> 
<P>
The account of the 430 year sojourn of Israel in Egypt is largely
passed over in silence in the Biblical account, except for the
events of the age of Joseph and his brothers and the period of
severe captivity toward the end. The long interval in between
these events is summed up in a single verse stressing the numerical
increase of the Israelites in Egypt (Exodus 1:7).
<P>
<I><B>Archeology and Moses' Birth</B></I> 
<P>
The name of Moses, the great deliverer and law giver, dominates
the last 40 years of Hebrew residence in Egypt. The story of how
the Egyptian princess found him in the boat of papyrus among the
reeds by the riverside has many parallels in ancient lore.
<P>
For instance, the story of Sargon I (The Great) of Akkad (c. 2100
BC), is recorded on a tablet dating from the 9th century BC:
<P>
My humble mother conceived me; she bore me in secret, placed me
in an ark of bulrushes, made fast my door with pitch and gave
me to the river which did not overwhelm me. The river lifted me
up and carried me to Akki the irrigator...Akki the irrigator hauled
me out...took me to be his son and brought me up.
<P>
Similar stories are told of Romulous and Remus, Bacchus, and Perseus.
As one writer commented (Caigen):
<P>
There is no need to postulate a common origin for such simple
and natural romances, but if one must do so, the episode of Moses
(16th century BC) may have been the inspiration of them all.
<P>
<I><B>Moses' Egyptian Name</B></I> 
<P>
That Moses was born in Egypt and reared under strong Egyptian
influence is independently attested by his clearly Egyptian name
supported by the Egyptian names current among his Aaronic kinsmen
for two centuries.
<P>
The name itself is apparently nothing more than the Egyptian <I>Mas-e</I>,
(pronounced <I>Mose</I> after the 12th century BC; Heb. <I>Moshe</I>):
the Egyptian word for &quot;son&quot; or &quot;child&quot;. It
appears in other Egyptian names such as Ahmose (son of Ah, the
god of Light) or Thutmose (son of Thoth).
<P>
Two possibilities exist for the name as we see it in the Bible:
<P>
1. Pharaoh's daughter did not give a special name to this unknown
infant, a child of an alien race, and simply contented herself
by calling him &quot;the child&quot;.
<P>
2. More likely, Moses is a hypocoristicon -- that is, a shortened
form of his full name (something like a nick-name). For instance,
Tiglath Pileser III is refered to as <I>Pul</I> in the Old Testament
(from the Akk. <I>Pulu</I>; see 2 Kings 15:19. Cf. English Bill
for William or Ted for Edward/Theodor).
<P>
<I><B>The Egyptian Plagues</B></I> 
<P>
The account of the ten plagues, like the story of Joseph, abounds
in authentic local coloring. The miricles consisted of events
that were natural to Egypt, the supernatural element consisting
in the great augmentation of their normal intensity, as well as
their timing. In other words, the disasters are not imported from
some other region; they are the sorts of troubles that Egypt has
known before, just far far worse.
<P>
Also of significance: at least some of the plagues seemed to be
directed against specific gods of Egypt, not just the people --
perhaps to demonstrate thereby Yahweh's superiority. That Egypt's
gods were being cursed, in some way, is made clear by Exodus 12:12.
Just in what way and to what extent the pagan cults were involved
in the plagues is not entirely clear, however.
<P>
The knowledge extant concerning the practical, everyday worship
of the Egyptian pantheon is meager; moreover, the source materials
tell us little about their metaphysical assumptions.
<P>
It is obvious, however, that the twenty-two Egyptian provinces
each had their own religious centers and totemic animal or plant.
<P>
It is precisely the attributes of these deities which are involved
in the plagues, but whether each of the plagues was thought to
be the special domain of one or another of the Egyptian gods cannot
be stated with certainty.
<P>
The plagues, however, were an outward physical consequence of
inward moral conditions.
<P>
G. Vos writes (Biblical Theology, 1954, pp. 124-130):
<P>
Not merely the Egyptians, but likewise the Egyptian's gods are
involved in the conflict.
<P>
The situation of the Exodus from Egypt comprised not merely the
physical bondage of the Jews but also the spiritual oppression
of sin from which they were released by an act of God's special
grace.
<P>
In the same fashion that Yahweh intervened to free them from pharaoh,
so also he freed them from the restraints and penalty of their
iniquity. Nowhere in the OT is the particularistic quality of
God's grace so openly declared as in Exodus.
<P>
The identical judgment and circumstances that delivered Israel
sentenced Egypt: one was sentenced to salvation, one to reprobation.
As a prefigurement of the sacrifice of Christ upon the cross,
the Exodus and the plagues which accompanied it derive their true
meaning and proper perspective.
<P>
The sacred poetry of later ages celebrate the event, and the clear
remembrance of it is reiterated at the Pasover and celebration
of the first communion by Jesus before his death. The two events,
the Exodus and the Passion, are acts of God's special grace, by
which not only deliverence but atonement and redemption are accomplished.
<P>
In the OT motif of creation: fall, redemption, restoration --
the Exodus and the plagues are an event of momentous proportion.
Upon it rests the faith of Israel in the covenant promises of
God.
<P>
The restriction of the miraculous events of the Exodus to one
small area and to one short period of time demonstrates the divine
chaaracter of the action. The miricles of the Bible are not magical
ways to accomplish difficult feats in front of an illiterate,
credulous and prescientific audience. They are transcendant and
supernatural assurances that the word -- the revelation -- given
at the same time, in this case the ordinances of Passover and
the Law -- are true and absolute, having divine authority.
<P>
The declaration of God: &quot;and I will harden Pharaoh's heart,
and...multiply my signs and wonders in the land of Egypt&quot;
(Exodus 7:3) is for the purpose that &quot;the Egyptians shall
know that I am Yahweh!&quot; (Exodus 7:5).
<P>
Ultimately, the plagues caused Egypt in its suffering to admit
Yahweh's sovereignty and to glorify the God of Israel. There is
some speculation (if you take an early date for the Exodus) that
part of the reason for Ikhnatan's reformation and rejection of
the traditional gods of Egypt were as a reaction to these plagues.
In Ikhnatan's mind, it is possible that the traditional gods had
been discredited and shown to be nonexistant, or at the least,
to be weak and ineffectual.
<P>
<B>List of the Plagues and Possible Identification With Egyptian
Gods</B> 
<P>
1. Blood (Ex. 7:14-25)
<P>
The Nile god Hapi was a main object of worship and closely associated
with Osiris and even Amon. Khnum was the guardian of the Nile.
Osiris: the Nile was his bloodstream.
<P>
2. Frogs (Ex. 8:1-14)
<P>
Frogs werer sacred animals, the symbol of procreative power. They
were associated with the goddess Heka (Heket, Heqt), who is represented
with the head of a frog (god of resurrection). She is the wife
of Kneph (or Nun). Such sacred animals as frogs could not be killed
intentionally. Even involentary slaughter was punishable by death.
<P>
3. Gnats (Ex. 8:16-19)
<P>
4. Flies (Ex. 8:20-32)
<P>
Some have suggested this was actually a plague of beetles; if
so, beetles were sacred, and like any sacred creature, could not
be intentionally harmed. The beetle (scarab) was the emblem of
Re (Ra), the sun god.
<P>
5. Livestock (Ex. 9:1-7)
<P>
Several Egyptian deities were represented by domestic beasts:
Apis, the bull god; Hathor, the cow goddess; Khnum, the ram god;
and Mnevis, the bull god, symbol of fertility and sacred bull
of Heliopolis.
<P>
6. Boils (Ex. 9:8-12)
<P>
Imhotep, god of medicine (uncertain that this deity was being
worshipped in Egypt at this early date)
<P>
7. Hail (Ex. 9:13-35)
<P>
Perhaps an attack on the sky goddess, Nut; Isis, goddess of life;
Seth, protector of crops.
<P>
8. Locusts (10:1-20)
<P>
Isis was considered the protectoress against locusts. Seth, the
protector of crops.
<P>
9. Darkness (10:21-29)
<P>
May have been brought by the Khamsin (wind of the desert). Re
(Ra) the sun god would have been the intended target. Darkness
was a creation of Set, the evil principle, the destroyer of Osirus.
To the Egyptians, it would have seemed as if Re was dead, Set
had triumphed over his brother, and Apophis had encircled the
world with his dark folds.
<P>
10. First-born (Ex. 11:1-12:36)
<P>
First-born of people and animals were often worshipped. Pharaoh
was considered a god (incarnation of Re), as was his first-born
son, the heir to the throne. Osiris, the giver of life.
<P>
<I><B>Route of the Exodus</B></I> 
<P>
Israel's exit from Egypt as outlined in the Biblical narrative
formerly (and in some circles, still does) excite a great deal
of skepticism and debate. Many contend that the route described
in the book of Exodus was impossible, and that the Exodus itself
was, accordingly, legendary, or at best, historically unrealiable.
<P>
Others insisted on a northern passage along the Meditteranean,
despite definite Biblical assertions to the contrary (Ex. 13:17-18).
For instance, the well-respected and popular <I>Macmillan's Atlas
of the Bible</I> does precisely this.
<P>
Advocates of the southern route have the decided advantage, I
believe. The initial stages of the Exodus are described in Exodus
12:37, 13:17-20 and 14:1-2. In tracing this itinerary on a map,
it is important to first observe that the translation of the Hebrew
name <I>yam suph</I> by Red Sea is plainly incorrect. The Hebrew
word <I>suph</I> clearly means &quot;reed.&quot; For instance,
notice Ex. 2:3 which describes Moses' mother placing his floating
basket among &quot;the reeds&quot;; the Hebrew word there is <I>suph</I>.
<P>
That this name is unlikely to denote what we today refer to as
the Red Sea or even its northeastern arm (the Gulf of Suez) is
indicated by the fact that there are no reeds in the Red Sea.
Moreover, the body of water they actually crossed formed a natural
barrior between Egypt and the Sinai wilderness, whereas the Israelites
would have had to traverse a long expanse of desert to get to
the Red Sea or even the Gulf of Suez, a trek that the text does
not seem to suggest.
<P>
On the contrary, the account implies the proximity of the Reed
Sea to Succoth (modern Tel-el-Mashkutah), about 32 miles southeastward
of their starting point of Rameses (Ex. 12:37).
<P>
The Reed (or Papyrus) Sea which the Israelites miraculously crossed
may be the Papyrus Lake or Papyrus Marsh known from an Egyptian
document of the 13th century to have been located near Tanis.
The topography of this region has been changed somewhat since
the Suez Canal was dug. In fact, at least one body of water, Lake
Ballah, has disappered as a result.
<P>
In the 15th century BC the region in the vincinity of Lake Timsah,
between Lake Ballah and the Bitter lakes, may well have been more
marshy than it is at present, and the crossing of the &quot;Reed
Sea&quot; was perhaps in the are of Lake Timsah or just south
of it.
<P>
The location of the city of Rameses (earlier Avaris-Zoan and later
Tanis) has given Biblical geographers a starting point in verifying
the accuracy of the Biblical route of the Exodus. Thus, leaving
Rameses the escaping Israelites began a roundabout journey toward
Canaan.
<P>
The direct military route lay before them past the Egyptian frontier
fortress of Zilu (or Thel) and then along the coast by &quot;the
way of the land of the Philistines (Ex. 13:17).
<P>
This being the well-traveled and carefully guarded highway to
the Egyptian Asiatic Empire in Palestine and Lower Syria, the
Israelites, as yet only a disorganized mob of liberated slaves,
were in no position either from the point of view of moral or
military organization to wage the war such a route would have
almost immediately precipitated (cf. Ex. 13:17).
<P>
Leaving Succoth, which is located some ten miles in an easterly
direction from Pithom (Ex. 1:11), now identified with Tel Retabeh,
the Israelites encamped on the borders of &quot;the wilderness
of the Reed Sea&quot; (Ex. 13:18-20), that is, in the general
region of Lake Timsah. Pi-hahiroth, which is said to be &quot;between
Migdol and the [Reed] Sea&quot; and &quot;in front of Baal-Zephon&quot;
(Ex. 14:2), seems clearly to be the Egyptian Pi-Hathor in the
general vicinity of Tanis.
<P>
Although Migdol and Baal-Zephon bear Semitic names, which are
perfectly normal for this part of Egypt, and are attested by the
inscriptions, their exact location as yet has not been fully determined.
<P>
For this reason, it is possible that the Israelites in their meandering
trip at this point (Ex. 13:18), may have wandered futher northward
than is commonly supposed and crossed the water in the region
of Lake Ballah.
<P>
At any rate, the Biblical route, as outlined in Exodus, bears
every indication of being authentic.

<I><B>Research Supports Bible's Account of Red Sea Parting</B></I>

<P>
<I><B>Weather: Gulf of Suez's geography would make it possible,
meteorologist and oceanographer say.</B></I> 
<P>
By Thomas H. Maugh II (Timses Science Writer)
<P>
Sophisticated computer calculations indicate that the biblical
parting of the Red Sea, said to have allowed Moses and the Israelites
to escape from bondage in Egypt, could have occured precisely
as the Bible describes it.
<P>
Because of the peculiar geography of the northern end of the Red
Sea, researchers report Sunday in the Bulletin of the American
Meteorological Society, a moderate wind blowing constantly for
about 10 hours could have caused the sea to recede about a mile
and the water level to drop 10 feet, leaving dry land in the area
where many biblical scholars believe the crossing occured.
<P>
An abrupt change in the wind would have allowed the waters to
come crashing back into the area in a few moments, a phenomenon
that the Bible says inundated the Israelites' pursuers.
<P>
This explanation &quot;should not affect the religious aspects
of the Exodus,&quot; wrote meteorologist Nathan Paldor of the
University of Rhode Island and oceanographer Doron Nof of Florida
State University. &quot;Some may even find our proposed mechanism
to be a supportive argument for the original biblical description
of this event.&quot;
<P>
Although few religious scholars or scientists were familiar with
the report, oceanographer Gabriel Csanady of Old Dominion University
in Norfolk, Va., said the new scenario is &quot;very plausible.&quot;
Csanady was one of the reviewers who recommended publication of
the report in the Bulletin.
<P>
The Israelites' flight is described in the 14th chapter of the
book of Exodus: &quot;The Lord caused the sea to go bck by a strong
east wind all the night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters
were divided. And the children of Israel went into the midst of
the sea on the dry ground.&quot;
<P>
Most scholars agree that the Israelites did not cross the Red
Sea, but the Gulf of Suez, which is a northern extension of the
sea. The crossing probably occured at the northern end of the
gulf, around the site of the modern town of Suez.
<P>
Paldor, who is on sabbatical in Rhode Island from the Hebrew University
of Jerusalem, said he became interested in the problem because
of his acquaintance with the biblical descriptions and because
it is an interesting, unsovled problem in physical oceanography.
The problem consists of simple physical laws -- which are very
well known -- and a very complicated set of equations that describe
what happens to the water when the wind acts on it.&quot;
<P>
His and Nof's contribution, he said, was to simplify the equations
so that the calculations could be performed in a resonable amount
of time and without the need for an expensive supercomputer.
<P>
They found that the gulf's geographical configuration makes it
possible for the waters to part. Because the gulf is so long and
shallow, Nof said, &quot;the wind can lift a lot of water. It's
like blowing across the top of a cup of coffee. The coffee blows
from one end of the cup to the other.
<P>
Also important, they noted, is that the other end of the gulf
is connected to a large body of water, the Red Sea. That sea can
accomodate the water from the gulf without rising significantly.
<P>
Their calculations show that a steady northeasterly wind of about
40 to 45 m.p.h. over a 10-hour period could push the water of
the gulf back from the northern shore by as much as a mile, lowering
its depth by 10 feet or more. Such wind-driven reductions in water
level are frequently observed during winter storms in Lake Erie,
Paldor said, but the bottom slope there is much steeper than in
the Gulf of Suez, so the shoreline does not recede.
<P>
Such a phenomenon would not completely explain the bilbical passage,
which says that the Israelites had water on oboth sides of them
when they made the crossing. Paldor and Nof speculate that the
group actually crossed on an underwater ridge that was exposed
by this receding water. In that case, there would have been water
on both sides.
<P>
No such ridge apparently exists at the site now, but Csanady has
previously shown that such ridges are formed and destroyed frequently.
<P>
One potential objection to the new theory is that the researchers
postulate a northwesterly (sic -- should be northeasterly) wind,
while the Bible cites an east wind. But they note that in Hebrew
texts, the wind prior to the crossing is described as Ruach kadim,
which can mean northeasterly or southeasterly.
<P>
Other researchers have previously suggested that the parting of
the Red Sea might have been caused by a tsunami, a massive tidal
wave resulting from an earthquake. Such an even could have caused
the waters to recede briefly and then crash back upon the pursuers.
<P>
But the biblical account &quot;specifically addresses a strong
wind that blew for the entire night before the crossing,&quot;
Paldor said, and indicates that the waters receded gradually.
<P>
Thus the tsunami explanation, he said, is simply not tenable.
<P>
<B>The Exodus</B> 
<P>
<I><B>The Date</B></I> 
<P>
When was the Exodus of the Israelites from Egypt?
<P>
The chronology of the Exodus has presented problems which are
undoubtedly among the most perplexing in the whole of Hebrew history.
It has been the subject of heated debate for a number of years
and the difficulties have not yet been fully resolved (though
those on all sides of the issue might argue otherwise). Two of
the main conflicting views have a difference of about a century
and a half between them. Both can be supported to some extent
by the biblical narratives.
<P>
The earliest dating places the Exodus in the reign of Amenhotep
II of the 18th Dynasty.
<P>
The later view regards the Exodus as occuring in the 19th Dynasty,
when Rameses II ruled Egypt.
<P>
The 15th c. date depends on:
<P>
1. The chronological note in 1 Kings 6:1
<P>
2. The date of the conquest of Canaan
<P>
3. The fall of Jericho
<P>
4. Archaeological material
<P>
Assuming the reference in 1 Kings referst to c. 961 BC, the Exodus
would have occured c. 1441 BC.
<P>
The excavations of Garstang at Jericho provided further support
for this date when it was announced that Jericho had fallen to
invaders before 1400 BC. It was also stated that diplomatic contact
between Jericho and Amehotep III (c. 1413-1377 BC) ceased; thus,
Amehotep II (c. 1436-1422 BC) could be the pharaoh of the Exodus.
<P>
The fall of Jericho had been preceded by the Israelite occupation
of Moab, which, according to Jephtha in Judges 11:26 extended
over a period of about 300 years. If the date of 1100 BC is given
for Jephtha, the occupation of Moabite territory would have taken
place around 1400 BC, which then also gives a 15th c. BC date
for the Exodus.
<P>
Circumstances in Egyptian history have also been suggested in
favor of a date at this time, thereby making Thutmose III the
great Egyptian empire builder and the pharoah of the last Israelite
oppression. A mural in the tomb of Rekhmire, the Vizier of Thutmose
III depicts a brick making scene, where slaves are moistening
lumps of nile mud, adding sand and chopped straw, and placing
the mixture into molds for baking in the sun.
<P>
The mural also contains the inscription reminscent of advice given
by the taskmasters to the enslaved Hebrews: &quot;The rod is in
my hand; be not idle.&quot;
<P>
The mention of the invading Habiru in the Tel-el-Amarna tablets
(c. 1400-1300 BC) was taken as particularly significant for an
early date of the Exodus.
<P>
The Habiru were equated with the conquering Hebrews (there may
be a link between the words Habiru and 'Ivri; Habiru is used generically
of nomads and the earliest uses in the Bible of the word 'Ivri
seem to match the same usage). The disturbed political conditions
reflected in the Tel-el-Amarna tablets were held to be those which
existed in Canaan before the Israelite invasion.
<P>
The feudal system under which the land was ruled made for small
fortified centers. It was necessary for the local rulers to pay
their annual dues to the Egyptian overlord or to his representative.
<P>
During the time of Ikhnatan, Egypt was weak and many cities were
revolting, as well as suffering from the invasion of outsiders.
<P>
<I><B>The Date of the Exodus</B></I> 
<P>
Although up to the present no direct archaeological evidence has
been found of Israel's sojourn in Egypt, nevertheless in the light
of considerable inderect testimony, it is practically impossible
with any show of reason to deny either the historicity of Moses
or the fact of the Exodus. As schlars generally concede, an event
which impressed itself so ineradicably on the consciousness of
a people as to control al its later thinking, to be the foundation
of its national history and to ratify its religion, could by no
stretch of the imagination have been a mere invention. It would
be like postulating the American Revolution never occured and
that George Washington was just a legend, with no historical basis.
<P>
The real problem is not, <I>did</I> it happen, but rather <I>when</I>
and <I>how</I> did it happen.
<P>
The date of the Exodus is a particularly elusive problem, which
has divided not just critical scholars, but also conservative
evangelicals.
<P>
Excluding (for the moment), the radical and extreme views of people
like Gardner, Hall and Wresninski who consider the Exodus story
to be a garbled form of the Egyptian saga of the Expulsion of
the Hyksos, or people like Petrie, Eerdmans, and Rowley who place
it very late, in the reign of Merneptah or even later, only two
principal views exist. The first places the event around 1441
BC (dates ranging from 1467 to 1425 have been proposed), thus
placing it in the reign of Amenhotep II (or Thuhmose III c. 1482-1450).
The second places the Exodus around 1290 BC in the reign of Ramses
II, of the 19th Dynasty.
<P>
<I><B>The Early Date</B></I> 
<P>
Although any view of the Exodus is plagued with difficulties so
great that many critics insist &quot;that complete harmonization&quot;
of the Biblical account &quot;and our extra-biblical material
is quite impossible,&quot; it is nevertheless true on the basis
of many considerations that the early date (1441 BC) most easily
fits the biblical material.
<P>
Many would deny this on the basis of Exodus 1:11 and its mention
of the city of Rameses, together with other evidence external
to the Bible. But it is quite clear from a careful survey of all
the scriptural evidence, including the whole time scheme underlying
the Pentateuch and the early lhistory of Israel through the period
of the Judges to the time of Solomon, that the OT places Moses
and the period of the Exodus around the middle of the 15th century
BC rather than a century and a half later in the first half of
the 13th century BC. Biblical and extrabiblical evidence in support
of this is not easily set asside, in my estimation.
<P>
1. Explicit scriptural statement places the Exodus around 1441
BC (see 1 Kings 6:1).
<P>
The fourth year of Solomon's reign (although the chronology still
oscillate about a decade) would be about 961 BC. W.F. Albright
gives 922 BC as the date of Solomon's death. Edwin R. Thiele 931
BC for ye year of his death, and Joachim Begrich 926 BC as the
year of his death. And since Solomon ruled 40 years (1 Kings 11:42),
the 4th year of his reign would be variously computed:
<P>
Albright: 958 BC
<P>
Thiele: 967 BC
<P>
Begrich: 962 BC.
<P>
If we take Unger's year (961 BC), then we arrive at 1441 BC as
the date of the Exodus, and 1871 BC as the time of the entrance
into Egypt by Joseph and family (since the sojourn is recorded
as lasting 430 years -- Exodus 12:40-41).
<P>
Scholars such as Albright, who argues for a date of the Exodus
150 years later (c. 1290 BC) and H.H. Rowley, who places it over
200 years later (1225 BC) are compelled to reject 1 Kiings 6:1
as late and unreliable, or they would argue that the number given
there is symbolic (480 years, after all, does break down into
12 x 40, which has a certain look of artificiality about it, after
all). The time of the Judges, if a late date for the Exodus is
accepted, must be shortened from the 1400-1050 BC an early date
would give, to about 1250-1050 BC, necessitating doubling up some
of the Judges (admittedly not at all an impossible task, since
they often operated in limited spheres in different parts of Palestine).
<P>
2. Contemporary Egyptian history permits a date for the Exodus
c. 1441 BC. The date of 1441 BC falls very probably in the opening
years of the reign of Amenhotep II (1450-1425 BC), son of the
famous conquereor and empire builder, Thutmose III (1482-1450
BC). One of the greatest of all the Pharaohs, Thutmose III furnishes
an ideal figure for the Pharoaoh of the oppression. According
to the Biblical record Moses waited for the death of the great
oppressor before returning to Egypt from his refuge in Midian
(Ex. 3:23). The Exodus took place not very long afterward in the
reign of Amenhotep II, who evidently was the king who hardened
his heart and would not let the Israelites go.
<P>
In the contempoary records of Amenhotep II no references occur
to such national disasters as the ten plagues or the loss of the
Egyptian army in the Reed Sea, much less to the escape of the
Jews. But that absence does not demonstrate it didn't happen during
his reign. The Egyptian government, like any totalitarian government,
were not quick to record their misfortunes. They were like the
old USSR in that respcet: airplane crash? You wouldn't have heard
about it in the government controlled media. Only happy news,
since bad things only happened to the capitalists in America.
<P>
If Amenhotep II was the reigning pharaoh of the exodus, his eldest
son was slain in the tenth plague, &quot;which killed all the
firstborn of the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh
on his throne to the firstborn of the captive in the dungeon...&quot;
(Exo. 12:29). It is plain from the monuments that Thutmose IV
(1425-1412 BC) who escavated the Sphinx, was not the eldest son
of Amenhotep II. The so-called &quot;Dream Inscription of Thutmose
IV&quot; recorded on an immense slab of red granite near the sphinx
at Gizeh states that while yet a youth, the future Pharaoh had
fallen asleep under the famous monument and dreamed. In his dream
the sphinx appeared to him, startling him with a prophecy that
one day he would become king of Egypt, and asked him to clear
the sand away from her feet in token of gratitude. (for a copy
of the text, see Pritchard, p. 449).
<P>
The general historical situation made the Exodus possible toward
the beginning of the reign of Amenhotep II. At the death of the
great Thutmose III the whole of the outlying parts of the Empire
in Syria-Palestine revolted. The new Pharaoh moved against he
insurrectionists and crushed them, but it may well be that the
distractions of this campaign created a diversion, the advantage
of which Moses was not slow to seize.
<P>
The picture of Thutomose III as the great oppressor of the Israelites
is quite credile. He was a great builder and employed semitic
captives in his vast construction projects. Many of his building
operations were supervised by his vizier, named Rekhmire. This
important official or prime minister exercised powers as extensive
as those of his earlier colleague, Joseph. His tomb near Thebes
is covered with scenes depicting his career. In one of these representations
Rekhmire leans upon his staff and inspects stonecutters, sculptors,
brickmakers and builders who toil before him.
<P>
A portion of the scene on Rekhmire's tomb depicts the brickmakers.
Brickmaking in ancient Egypt was a process which invovled breaking
up the Nile mud with mattocks, moistening it with water, and mixing
it with sand and chopped straw (Ex. 5:6-19). Afterwards it was
formed in molds and baked in the sun. Semitic foreigners are significantly
found among the brickmakers and bricklayers on Rekhmire's tomb.
The accompanying inscription refers to the &quot;captives brought
by his majesty for the works of the temple of Amun.&quot; The
bricklayers are quoted as saying &quot;He supplies us with bread,
beer and every good thing,&quot; while the taskmasters warn the
laborers &quot;the rod is in my hand; be not idle.&quot;
<P>
3. Contempoary events in Palestine suggest a date for the Exodus
around 1441 BC. When I was at UCLA I had an Akkadian Seminar on
the Amarna letters, which involved translating them and discussing
various aspects. I was taught that the Habiru mentioned in the
tablets could not refer to the Hebrews, since the Hebrews didn't
enter the land until the 13th century BC -- not the 15th c., when
the letters were written.
<P>
However, having said that, the letters present a strikingly similar
situation of what was described in Joshua, except from the point
of view of the conquered rather than the conquerer.
<P>
The Amarna letters were discovered in 1886. These invaders, the
Habiru, are etymologically acually equatable with the Hebrews,
though, of course, some scholars would disagree with me on that.
<P>
Abdi-Hiba, governor of Jerusalem, wrote numerous letters to the
Pharaoh Ikhnatan, begging for Egyptian aid against the encroaching
Habiru, if the country were to be saved for Egypt:
<P>
The Habiru plunder all lands of the king. If archers are here
this year, then the lands of the king, the Lord, will remain;
but if the archers are not here, then the lands of the king, my
Lord, are lost.
<P>
<I><B>Late Date for the Exodus</B></I> 
<P>
According to Genesis 15:13, the descendants of Abraham were to
be afflicted in a strange land for 400 years, while the tradition
of Exodus 12:40 extends the sojourn to 430 years. The LXX, however,
reduces the period in Exodus 12:40 to 215 years. However, this
215 year period would not be easily reconcilabe then with Gen.
15:13.
<P>
Part of the difficulty of interpreting the reference in 1 Kings
6:1 correctly lies in the fact that the peoples of the ANE sometimes
used numbers to signify other than purely mathematical considerations.
<P>
Thus the phrase &quot;40 years&quot; was synonymous with the concept
&quot;generation&quot;, while in Genesis 50:26 the period of 110
years, which marked the life span of Joseph, was the traditional
Egyptian figure for a full life, or simply advanced old age. It
is not always easy on such occasions to determine whether the
biblical numbers are being used literally or symbolically.
<P>
Where there appears to be a motif or cycle involving sevens, forties,
and the like, it is probable that other than purely literal considerations
are involved. When the reference in 1 Kings 6:1 is examined from
this standpoint, it is obvious that the number could be understood
to comprise 12 generations of 40 years each. This appears to involve
a double cycle, and may be related in some manner to the idea
of successive generations as applied to the 12 tribes. Of course,
when it says 4th year in the same verse, we will still tend to
understand it &quot;literally&quot;....
<P>
As a supporter of the late date wrote: &quot;If the number [480]
is taken literally, however, it argues strongly for a fifteenth
century date of the Exodus.&quot;
<P>
The 13th century date for the Exodus is postulated primarily on
the basis of the reference in Exodus 1:11 to the city of &quot;Rameses&quot;,
which implies that the Israelites were in bondage during the reigns
of Seti I and Rameses II. Contemporary inscriptions do refer to
a people the Egyptians called &quot;Apiru&quot; laboring for Rameses
II; &quot;Apiru&quot; are identified by most scholars as equivalent
to the Akkadian &quot;Habiru&quot;.
<P>
Additional evidence for a 13th century date for the Exodus emerged
from the work of Glueck in the Transjordan. He discovered that
after the time of Abraham, the territories of Edom and Moab became
denuded of population until the 13th century BC.
<P>
From this, it becomes evident that the conditions of population
that necessitated the circuit of Edom and the difficult campaign
against the Ammonites at Heshbon (Num. 20-21) could scarcely have
existed until the 13th century BC, after which time Edom was densly
populated.
<P>
A late date for the fall of Jericho, c. 1250 BC was suggested
by Vincent, an eminent Palestinian archeologist, who rested his
conclusions, to some extent, on the discovery of immitation Mycenaean
vases at Jericho.
<P>
These had probably been imported from Greek sources when the Minoan
civilization of Crete (2000-1000 BC) had exercised an important
cultural influence over the lands of the mediterranean, and belonged
properly to the Late Bronze II period (c. 1375-1200 BC), after
which they were no longer imported.
<P>
However, other archeological considerations weigh heavily against
so late a date for the Exodus, including the fact that a whole
series of Canaanite cities, such as Lachish and Bethel fell in
the 13th c. BC.
