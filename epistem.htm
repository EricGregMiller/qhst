<B>Introduction</B>
<P>
 Epistemology is the study of knowledge; more precisely, it deals
with a very basic question that most people never even stop to
consider: how do we know what we know, and how do we know that
what we think we know really is the way we think it is?
<P>
 Nothing seems more certain than what we witness.  In courtrooms,
people are called to the stand to describe what they have heard
or seen, and such testimony is accepted at face value.  Yet, there
have been interesting studies on the less than reliable nature
of eye-witness testimony.
<P>
 Daniel L. Schacter, author of<I> Searching for Memory: The Brain,
the Mind, and the Past</I> (Basic Books) writes:
<P>
 In Hawaii, a man awakes after an apparent mugging unable to identify
himself, believing that it is 1988 and Ronald Reagan is president.
The news reports describe how he gradually recalled his name,
Social Security number, hometown and college alma mater.  But
routine checks revealed that none of the information was accurate.
<P>
 Halfway around the world, families grieve for victims of the
TWA Flight 800 crash.  Questions from reporters bring forth a
flood of vignettes confirming the reality of the deceased through
the lives they had lived.
<P>
 Viewed together, these two seemingly unrelated events contrast
memory's strenths and weaknesses: at times highly elusive and
occasionally dead wrong, but still our most useful tool for maintaing
our most strongly held beliefs about and cherished ties to the
past.
<P>
 To comprehend the fragile power of human memory, we need to go
beyond the myth that memory operates like a movie camera, passively
recording the details of our past experience for future viewing.
 Try to remember the last time you died in a restaurant or your
first day of kindergarten.  Do you see yourself in the scene?
<P>
 For most people, their memory of that first day of kindergarten
will include an image of that most important character: ourselves.
 This is called an observer memory.  But a recent visit to a restaurat
will likely be remembered from the perespective that we originally
viewed the scene.
<P>
 That we have observer memories at all shows that what we remember
is not a literal record of a past event -- we cannot have seen
ourselves in the event at the time the record was made.  But even
more telling, experiments have shown that -- counterintuitively
-- when people are instructed to focus on how they felt during
a past episode, they tend to recall it from a field perspective.
 When instructed to focus on the objective circumstances of an
event, they tend to report it from the observer perspective. 
The way we reexperience our pasts depends on our purpose in remembering
it.  We don't replay memories; we construct them.
<P>
 Research in neuroscience has found that memories are not stored
in any single location in the brain.  Instead, the eleements we
need to reconstruct the past are scattered in bits and pieces
in different parts of the cortex, and we must retrieve and assemble
them.
<P>
 The constructive nature of memory provides clues concerning its
fragility.  Mounting evidence has shown that we are often vulnerable
to confusing the sources of our recollections: whether we heard
about an incident on the radio, read about it or learned about
it from a friend.
<P>
 In everyday life, source confusions can lead to disaster, as
in the case of an Australian psychologist who was accused of rape
when the victim provided police with a nearly exact description
of him.  Fortunately, the psychologist had an airtight alibi:
At the precise moment of the rape he was in the midst of a television
interview Iironically, about eyewitness memory).  The victim had
been watching the show and had confused the source of her memory,
linking the psychologist's clearly recalled appearance with that
of the rapist.
<P>
 Fortunately, in the absence of unusual conditions such as amnesia,
source confusions tend to occur mainly at the level of individual
incidents.  Our recollections of the general contours of our lives
-- how happy we were as  children, the characteristics of parents,
siblings, classmates and friends, while not entirely free of subjective
biases, are basically accurate....
<P>
 William Poundstone, in his book, <I>Labyrinths of Reason</I>,
relates the following story:
<P>
 Blue sky, sunshine, deja vu glazed with dread.  Something horrible
is going to happen about now.  It is a perfect summer day in a
meadow of tall grass. J.V. is following her brothers, lagging
lazily behind.  A shadow falls on the ground; something rustles
the grass.  J.V. turns -- she cannot help it, it is what happens
next -- and sees a strange man.  he has no face, like a minor
character in a dream.  The man holds something writhing and indistinct.
 He asks, &quot;How would you like to get into this bag with the
snakes?&quot;
<P>
 J.V.'s encounter is an unlikely milestone in twentieth-century
thought.  J.V., a fourteen year old girl, was not in a summer
field but on  an operating table in the Montreal Neurological
Institute.  Her physician, Wilder Penfield, was attempting an
experimental operation to relieve her violent epileptic seizures.
 The operating team had removed the side of J.V.'s skull to expose
the temporal lobe of the brain.  In order to located the site
of the attacks, Penfield probed the brain with an electrode connected
to an EEG machine.  The surgery was a collaboration between physician
and patient.  J.V. had to remain conscious throughout and help
locate the site of the seizures.  When Penfield touched the probe
to a certain spot on J.V.'s temporal lobe, she again found herself
in the field of grass...
<P>
 J.V.'s experience with the strange man had occurred seven years
earlier, in Canada, in what we call the real world.  She reported
seeing herself as she was then, a seven year old girl.  J.V. had
been frightened but not physically harmed, and ran crying home
to her mother.  These few moments of terror were to haunt her
over and over.  The man with the bag of snakes entered her dreams,
made them nightmares.  The trauma became interwoven with her epileptic
seizures.  Like a madeleine, a fleeting recollection would trigger
the whole memory, then an attack.
<P>
 Under the EEG probe, J.V. not merely recalled, but relived the
encounter.  All the richness of detail, all the lucid horror of
the original experience, came back. Penfield's probe caused the
brain to replay past experiences like a movie.  With bits of lettered
or numbered paper, Penfield kept track of the sites on the cerebral
cortex associated with the recollection.  Touching nearby points
produced different sensations.  When the probe touched one point,
J.V. produced only a phantasmagoria of colored stars.
<P>
 How do we know that reality is really there?  You think you're
sitting in a chair reading this book, but how do you know that
you're not actually a disembodied brain in a laboratory somewhere,
soaking in a vat of nutrients?  It could be that a mad scientist
has attached electrodes to your brain, and he is feeding a stream
of electrical impulses that exactly simulate the experience of
sitting in a chair, reading a book.  How in the world could you
ever disprove such a theory?
<P>
 After all, everything that you experience of the real world is
mediated through your senses of smell, taste, touch, hearing and
seeing -- and yet those senses come to your brain by way of electrical
impulses, that your brain is able to translate into a perception
of reality.
<P>
 There is an ancient Chinese tale about one Chuang-tzu, sometime
in the fourth century BC.  It seems that one day he awoke, having
dreamed he was a butterfly.  After a moment's reflection, he wondered
if he were instead a butterfly, dreaming that he was a man.  How
could he be certain?
<P>
 Rene Descartes was a seventeenth century philosopher, best known
for his statement, &quot;I think, therefore I am.&quot;   As we
saw in the brains in vats scenario, all we experience is the consequence
of a stream of nerve impulses.  The texture of a rock, the odor
of a locker room, the taste of liver, the sight of oneself in
the mirror first thing in the morning -- all are mediated, rather
than direct experiences.  The conventional picture of a real,
external world is not the only possible explanation for what our
nervous system is reporting to us.  Rene Descartes realized that
it is possible that there is an evil mad scientist experimenting
on our disembodied brains.
<P>
 Scientists place great faith in the evidence of our senses. 
All human beings, do.  Most people are skeptical about flying
saucers, not because the notion of visitors from other worlds
is inherently unreasonable, but simply because no one has yet
to produce unquestionable sensory evidence for their existence.
 Fuzzy photographs and incredible tales by eyewitnesses simply
are not enough, for most of us, because we can think of other,
more pedestrian explanations for the photographs and they stories
of the eyewitnesses.  As was said regarding the possible discovery
of fossil life on Mars, &quot;extraordinary  claims require extraordinary
evidence&quot;.
<P>
 However, the postulation of the brains in vats scenario turns
such thoughts inside out.  How can you know, by the evidence of
your senses, that you are not a brain in a vat?  You can't!  There
simply is no empirical evidence possible to disprove it.
<P>
 This, of course, stands as a significant blow to the idea that
everything can be known scientifically.  And we're not just talking
about what sort of noises a Veloceraptor might actually have made.
 If we cannot even know for certain whether the whole of reality
as we think we perceive it exists -- that our conventional view
of things might be outrageously wrong -- there must be rather
profound limitations on knowledge.
<P>
 So is anything certain?  Descartes' thoughts on an evil mad scientist
was his starting point in an investigation of how we know what
we know.  Descartes wrote:
<P>
 Some years ago I was struck by the large number of falsehoods
that I had accepted as true in my childhood, and by the highly
doubtful nature of the whole edifice that I had subsequently based
on them.  I realized that it was necessary, once in the course
of my life, to demolish everything completely and start again
right from the foundations if I wanted to establish anything at
all in the sciences that was stable and likely to last.
<P>
 Descartes wanted to address the issue of knowledge much in the
same way that Euclid had addressed geometry many years earlier.
 All of Euclid's geometry is derived from a set of five axioms.
 An axiom is a statement that is simply accepted as true as a
starting point, with no proof or disproof readily available. 
For instance, one of the axioms is that &quot;a straight line
may be drawn between any two points.  All the theorems -- statements
that may be proven or disproven -- of traditional geometry, are
derived from the five axioms.
<P>
 Thus, Descartes set out to identify a set of facts that were
known with utter certainty, that must be accepted as givens, with
no proof or disproof of them possible.  These facts, then, could
become the axioms of his natural philosophy, and all else would
be constructed upon that basic, firm foundation.
<P>
 To Descartes dismay, he discovered that practically any statement
one could utter about the real world must bear some measure of
doubt.  Descartes quickly found his ground floor of natural philosophy
was little more than quicksand.
<P>
 &quot;Quicksand&quot; very neatly describes ontology, the study
of what is real, since one of the first things one is apt to notice
is that the accepted, everyday &quot;facts&quot; of the external
world are all disputable.  One can almost always come up with
a scenario in which unquestioned beliefs can in fact be wrong.
<P>
 Is Paris the capital of France?
<P>
 Probably.
<P>
 However, it could be that our government, for reasons of its
own, does not want us to know the real capital of France.  They've
gotten all the history and geography books, and all the maps changed
to indicate that Paris is the capital, rather than what the real
capital is.  Year by year, teachers (for the most part, employees
of the government!) teach the Paris falsehood.
<P>
 Someone might claim they went to Paris and saw government buildings
that would reasonably be associated with that city being the capital.
 However, our government is sneaky: it created a theme park simulation
of Paris many years ago and regularly shuttles citizens there
to add credence to the Paris fiction.  People only <I>think</I>
they went to Paris, while in reality, they never went anywhere
near it.
<P>
 Of course, most reasonable people would find such an outrageous
conspiracy theory laughable. 
<P>
 Why?
<P>
 Perhaps because a less outlandish explanation, a less complicated
solution, would seem more likely.
<P>
 Is there anything of which we can be certain?  Any fundamental
truths?  
<P>
 Some might argue for mathematics.  Even if one's first grade
teacher were a dupe of the massive government Paris conspiracy,
it seems impossible to doubt that two and two is four.  One can,
in fact, picture two objects joining with two other objects to
form a group of four.  This deduction seems clearly true, regardless
if our traditional thoughts on reality are nonsense and we're
really only brains in vats.
<P>
 However, there are at least two problems with arguing for even
this as a core axiom.  First, even mathematics might be an illusion.
 Just because it seems impossible to imagine two and two ever
being anything other than four doesn't prove it's so.  It is obvious
that your brain is in a certain state when you come up with your
conclusion about the sum of two and two.  But what's to stop that
mad scientist who's playing with your brain from deluding you
about arithmetic at the same time as he's fooling you about the
physical world?  Maybe two and two is really seven.  But by stimulating
your brain in just the right way, the mad scientist has tricked
you into thinking it is obviously four.  Perhaps the mad scientist
has a whole row of brains in vats, each one immersed in a different
reality, with a different answer to the question of  &quot;what
is two plus two?&quot;
<P>
 A second problem with assuming mathematics as a ground is that
it is difficult, if not impossible to move from there to ever
justifying any beliefs about the physical world.  Certainty about
mathematics does nothing to tell us what the capital of France
might be.
<P>
<B>Theories of Knowledge</B>
<P>
 Epistemology, or the study of the theory of knowledge, comprises
the systematic study of the nature, sourses and validity of knowledge.
 It asks the question, &quot;Do we know an independent world or
merely our experience?&quot;  The possible answers can be broken
down into two broad categories with regard to their degree of
emphasis on the subjectivity or objectivity of knowledge.
<P>
 Subjectivistic theories of knowlege answer the epistemological
question thus: &quot;No, we don't know an independent world as
the cause of our ideas.  We cannot get beyond our experience or
ideas, and we cannot speak of a knower experiencing them.&quot;
<P>
 Objectivistic theories of knowledge answer the epistemological
question thus: &quot;Yes, we do know an independent world of material
objects and/or transcendent ideas.&quot;  In fact, most people
from a western philosophical background will answer the epistemological
question affirmatively.
<P>
 In a book of this nature, we can barely scratch the surface of
the epistemological issues, and we are necessarily simplifying
matters considerably.
<P>
 Some of the basic theories of knowledge are as follows:
<P>
<B>Skepticism</B>
<P>
 Denies the possibility of a complete or genuine knowledge of
an objective world, i.e., of a world apart from the knower or
his experience.  It may doubt the possibility of knowledge of
the self as well and confine knowledge to sense data and their
associations, as, e.g. did Hume, who confined knowledge and reality
to the &quot;stream of perceptions: as impressions and ideas.
<P>
 Some forms of skepticism:
<P>
 Solipsism: I alone exist, because I cannot know a world beyond
myself and my ideas.  This viewpoint leads to the egocentric predicament.
<P>
 Sensory skepticism: sensations are relative and unreliable because
they are modifications of the knower and no more a part of the
world than is the pinprick a part of the pin.
<P>
 Rational skepticism: the conclusions of reason are contradictory
and paradoxical.
<P>
 Methodological skepticism: a systematic but tentative doubt is
a prelude to genuine knowledge.
<P>
<B>Subjectivism</B>
<P>
 Subjectivism argues that because knowledge is confined to ideas
in the mind of the knower, it is impossible to get beyond these
ideas to an objective or material reality separate from and independent
of the knower.  Perceptions and things known are one (epistemological
monism) and  can only be known as ideas in the mind of the knower
(epistemological idealism).  Hence, the world is in the knower
or belongs to the knower.  Even if ideas represented an independent
reality, as realism contends, one could not possibly know it.
 &quot;Even if physical objects do not exist when no one is observing
them, we can have no reason to suppose that they do for no one
can observe them existing unobserved.&quot;
<P>
<B>Objectivism</B>
<P>
 Objectivism believes that objects are independent of mind and
present their properties directly to the knower through sense
data.  Things known and sense data are one (epistemological realism
as epistemological monism).
<P>
<B>Critical or representative realism</B>
<P>
 Critical or representative realism (epistemological dualism)
ascribes a critical role to mind in the formulation of knowledge.
 Unlike pure objectivism, it distinguishes between sense data
and the objects they represent (epistemological dualism).  But
the objects or things known are independent of mind or the knower
in the sense that thought refers to them -- not merely to sense
data or to the ideas of the knower.  Ideas represent objects.
<P>
Personalism
<P>
 
<P>
Neo-Thomism
<P>
Intuitionism
<P>
Pragmatism
<P>
Phenomenalism
<P>
<B>Christian Apologetics and Epistemology</B>
<P>
 There are essentially two schools of thought regarding Christian
apologetics -- that is, responces to charges and criticisms launched
against Christian belief, doctrine, and concepts: evidentialist
and pressupositionalist.
<P>
 Josh McDowel serves as a good example of the evidentialist.
<P>
 Corneilus Van Til serves as a good example of the presuppositionalist.
<P>
 Van Til, and other presuppositionalists would not necessarily
criticise the work that Josh McDowel does.  In fact, they would
likely arge that it is useful and necessary.  However, it does
not quite go far enough in that it fails to deal with the epistemological
issues.  Despite all that McDowel and others do, the bottom line
is that acceptance of the existence of God, the validity of the
Bible and Christian redemptive theology are not the consequence
of evidence, but rather, they are the result of presuppositions.
That is, the existence of God is an unprovable assumption.  Demonstrating
or falsifying it are essentially on the order of attempting to
demonstrate or falsify one of Euclid's five axioms.<HR>
