The author of the letter is Paul and &quot;all the brothers with

Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead -- and

B. Setting and Date
</ADDRESS>

<P>
The province of Galatia was established 25 BC and contained the
districts of Lycaonia and Isauria, as well as part of Pisidia
and Phrygia. The cities of Iconium, Derbe, Lystra and Pisidian
Antioch, which Paul had reached on his first missionary journey,
were part of the district, and it seems likely that it is to Christians
living in these four cities that Paul is writing his letter.

James Montgomery Boice (<I>The Expositor's Bible Commentary</I>,
vol. 10. Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1976, pp. 409-10) does an excellent
job of summarizing the situation at the time Paul wrote his letter
to the churches in Galatia:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
In the decade or so surrounding the year A.D. 50, the infant church
was drifting by degrees and at times almost unnoticeably toward
its first great doctrinal crisis. When the gospel was being preached
primarily to Jews by Jews, the development of the church progressed
smoothly. But as the ambassadors of Christ pushed out into largely
Gentile communities and the gospel began to take root there, questions
arose regarding a Christian's relationship to the law of Moses
and to Judaism as a system. Was the church to open her doors wide
to all comers, regardless of their relationship to the particularized
traditions of Judaism? Were her boundaries to be as wide as the
human race? Or was she to be only an extension of Judaism to the
Gentiles?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
In more particular terms, was it necessary for a Gentile believer
to observe the law of Moses in order to become a Christian? Should
a Gentile be circumcised? Questions like these must have been
raised with increasing force throughout the Roman Empire, wherever
the church of Jesus Christ camped on Gentile soil.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Galatians is a record of the form this struggle took in one area
of Asia Minor. but it is also a reflection of the way in which
the issue was being debated and handled in Jerusalem and at Antioch
in Syria. Acts supplements this information. Was it right for
Gentile and Jewish Christians to eat together? And could they
eat the same food? Was an orthodox Jew contaminated by such fellowship,
as Jewish traditions declared, or was he not? for a time, debate
seemed to move in a direction destructive of Christian unity and
of the survival of the gospel of grace, but Paul almost singlehandedly
withstood this trend and turned the tide. At Jerusalem the question
was taken up formally in council, and Paul's approach was upheld
(Acts 15:1-29).
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The date of the letter is to some extent dependent upon the trip
to Jerusalem he might be referring to in Galatians 2. If he is
referring to the trip that resulted in the decision of the Council
of Jerusalem (Acts 15), then perhaps the letter can be dated to
a time after AD 48 or 49, which is when the council took place.
Peter visited Paul in Antioch (Gal. 2:11-14), which of necessity
would then be after this council in Jerusalem. Since Paul is also
not in prison at the time he wrote to the Galatians, he had to
have written the letter prior to AD 58, when he was arrested in
Jerusalem (Acts 21).
<P>
Boyce, referring to Burton, suggests the following for placing
the letter:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
1. It might have been written from Corinth, in the period described
in Acts 18:1-17, either before or after he wrote 1 Thessalonians.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
2. It might have been written from Antioch, in the period described
in Acts 18:22.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
3. It might have been written from Ephesus, in the period described
in Acts 19.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
4. It might have been written from Macedonia or Achaia, in the
period described in Acts 20:1-3.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Boyce suggested a date around AD 52; Ephesus seems a good choice
because of the length of time he stayed there (close to three
years).
