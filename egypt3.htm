<P>
 There has been considerable debate concerning the precise route
of Israel after entering the wilderness, since Mt. Sinai or Horeb
(both names are applied to it) has not been identified with certainty.
 The Sinai Peninsula is a huge triangle, 260 miles long and 150
miles wide at the north.  At the apex of the peninsula there is
a mass of granite mountains, some of which reach an elevation
of 8000 feet above sea level.  Among these mountains were the
ancient copper and turquoise mines of the Egyptians, and here
is the traditional location of Mt. Sinai, where Moses received
the law and before which Israel camped.  The chief peak is called
Jebel Musa, Arabic for &quot;Mountain of Moses.&quot;
<P>
<I><B>Mosaic Laws and Other Codes</B></I>
<P>
 Archaeology has uncovered many ancient bodies of law and shed
much light on Sumerian, Babylonian, Assyrian, Hittite and Canaanite
codes through the excavations of the past century.  As a result,
Mosaic legislation appears in a much clearer perspective than
ever before.  Since its discovery at Susa in 1901-02, the Code
of Hammurappi (c. 1700 BC) has remained classic in illustrating
and illuminating Mosaic laws. To this code, however, must be added
the earlier laws of Lipit-Ishtar, king of Isin (in central Babylonia,
c. 1875 BC), and even earlier laws of Eshnunna, an ancient city
northeast of modern Baghdad.
<P>
 Hammurappi's famous Code, accordingly, appears as a comparative
late comer in Babylonia, where codes of law evidently had been
published in succession for centuries.  It is noteworthy, moreover,
that the Eshnunna Code, which antedate Hammurappi's laws by almost
two centuries, contains the first exact parallel to any early
biblical law.  This parallel concerns the division of oxen after
a fatal combat between animals (Ex. 21:35).  This parallel is
of particular significance since the Code of Eshnunna is at least
five centuries earlier than that section of the Mosaid legilation
commonly known as the Book of the Covenant (Ex. 20:23-23:19).
<P>
 Knowledge of Ancient Near Eastern jurisprudence has been greatly
increased over the past century by the excavation and publication
of Old Babylonian and Assyrian tablets from Kanish in Cappadocia
belonging to the nineteenth century BC.  Added to this is the
wealth of legal material of the fifteenth century BC revoverd
at Nuzu near modern Kirkuk since 1925.  Assyrian legal practice
has been illuminated by the publication of the cuneiform treasures
excavated by the Germans at the city of Assur on the igris, including
especially the laws from the period of Tiglath Pileser I (c. 1100
BC), which laws are likely based on earlier codes.  They were
first published in 1920.  Hittite laws, which show interesting
contrasts to early Babylonian jurisprudence, date a century or
two earlier than the laws of Tiglath Pileser I.  Compared with
these various laws &quot;the Book of the Covenant&quot; (Ex. 20:23-23:19)
exhibits a combination of simplicity in economic life and ethical
humanitarianism in human relations which could have arisen only
in early Israel.
<P>
<I><B>Mosaic Laws and the Code of Hammurappi</B></I>
<P>
 This slab of black diorite over seven feet tall and some six
feet wide contains engraved upon it almost three hundred paragraphs
of legal provisions dealing with the commercial, social, domestic
and moral life of the Babylonians of Hammurappi's time (c. 1792-1750
BC; keep in mind that the acutal date of Hammurappi is anything
but certain.  Moorey writes:
<P>
 Before the fourteenth c. BC the margin of error in absolute chronology
in Mesopotamia rises appreciably.  One problem in particular is
critical and must be mentioned here as it is very relevant to
correlations with Palestine in the later Middle Bronze Age.  The
date of the First Dynasty of Babylon, to which the famous King
Hammurappi belonged, still floats over a period of at least 120
years.
<P>
 According to current understanding the end of this dynasty might
be either in 1650, 1594, 1586 or 1530 BC.  These intervals are
governed by the primary surviving astronomical evidence.  From
the reign of King Ammisaduqa, the tenth and penultimate ruler
of this dynasty, have survived records of the first and last visibility
of Venus as morning and evening star for 21 years of his reign.
 This king began his reign 52 years before the end of the dynasty.
 The records only survive in late, corrpt copies, but astronomical
calculations have corrected them wehre necessary.  The dates of
the first and last appearances of Venus in the intercalated Babylonian
lunar calendar virtually repeat every 56 +/- 8 years.  With the
help of the venus observations, and supplementary archaeological
and historical evidence from a wide variety of sources, the majority
of scholars have increasingly come to accept the &quot;Middle
Chronology,&quot; ending the First Dynasty of Babylon about 1595
BC and thereby dating Hammurappi c. 1792-1750 BC.  This is the
system adopted for the revised Cambridge Ancient History.)
<P>
 At the top of Hammurappi's round topped stele, the king is shown
receiving the laws from the sun god, Shamash, the patron of law
and justice.  At some time when Babylon was weak, an Elamite conqueror
carried away the monument to Susa.  Its discovery there by Jacques
de Morgan in the early twentieth century constitutes one of the
most startling legal finds in history.
<P>
 In comparing the Code of Hammurappi with the Pentateuchal laws
the fact of the pirority of the Code (by well over 300 years)
has dispoded of some untenable theories and given rise to others.
 For instance, the old critical view that detailed codes of laws
like those found in the Pentateuch are anachronistic for so early
a period has been exploded by the discovery.  Again, higher critical
views which have placed the origin of many of the laws ascribed
to Moses in the ninth, eighth, or seventh century BC (or even
later), have had to be drastically revised or entirely rejcted.
 On the other hand, the discovery of the early extra-biblical
legal material has led many to adopt an equally faulty view that
Hebrew legislation is merely a selection and adaptation of Babylonian
law.  The valid position, which a careful study of the two bodies
of material will disclose, is that the Mosaic code is bneither
borrowed from nor dependant upon the Babylonian, but is divinely
given, as it claims to be, and unique in those features that met
Israel's peculiar need as an elect, theocratic nation.
<P>
1. The resemblances between Mosaic Laws and the Code are clearly
due to similarity of antecedents and general intellectual and
cultural heritage:
<P>
 It is only natural that in codes dealing with peoples in somewhat
similar conditions, related racially and culturally, there should
be some likeness in the incidents leading to litigation and likewise
in the penalties imposed for infringement of common statutes.
Striking differences, however, even in cases where there is similarity
in the matter at issue, demonstrate that there is no direct borrowing
and that the Mosaic is not dependent on the Babylonian.  The biblical
law of divorce (Deut. 24:1), for instance, permits the man to
put away his wife, but does not extend the same right to the wife,
as the Babylonian code does.
<P>
 Early Israelite laws were quite clearly divided into two groups,
civil laws of customary origin (Hebrew: <I>mishpatim</I>), which
are mainly contained in the Book of the Covenant (Exodus 20:23-23:33),
and moral and ethical injuncitions.  As might naturally be expected,
most of the former resemble similar laws in force among Israel's
precursors and neighbors throughout the Near East, whereas the
latter are a distinct product of the high moral and spiritual
standards of Yahwism, which might be paralleled elsewhere singly
but never in wholesale fashion.
<P>
 Exodus 21:23-25 and Deuteronomy 19:21 state concisely the same
principle of retaliation upon which a number of Hammurappi's laws
are based: &quot;Life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth,
hand for hand, foot for foot, burning for burning, wound for wound,
stripe for stripe.&quot;  This, the <I>Lex Talionis</I>, is a
Semitic custom that naturally would be expected to be reflected
in various Semitic legal codes.  A thing to bear in mind about
the <I>Lex Talionis</I> is that it was <I>not</I> harsh by their
standards (although at first reading it may seem so).  Rather,
it served as a limiting factor: a person could not be made to
suffer any more harm than he had done.  In otherwords, if you
stole a loaf of bread, you were not to be drawn and quartered.
You simply had to repay the bread!
<P>
2. The Mosaic and Hammurappi Codes are different in content:
<P>
 The Hebrew code contains many purely religious injunctions and
ritual regulations.  The Code of Hammurappi is civil.  However,
the priestly laws of Leviticus contain many points of contact
with corresponding priestly ritual and practice in Western Asia,
whether in Canaan and Phoenicia or in Mesopotamia.  But the divine
instituion on Israelite ritual practice made direct borrowing
unnecessary.  In some cases similar cultic practice among surrounding
people was divinely given to Israel and at the same time invested
with special significance for the worship of Yahweh.
<P>
3. The two codes regulate different types of society:
<P>
 Hammurappi's laws are adapted to the irrigation-culture and the
higly commercialized urban societyof Mesopotamia.  The Mosaic
injunctions, on the other hand, suit an agricultural, pastoral
people of a dry land like Palestine, much less advanced in social
and commercial development, but keenly conscious in all phases
of their living of their divine calling.
<P>
4. The two codes are different in their origin:
<P>
 The Babylonian code is alleged to have been received by Hammurappi
from the sun god Shamash.  Moses is said to have received his
laws directly from Yahweh.  Hammurappi, despite his purported
reception from Shamash, takes credit for the laws in both the
prologue and epilogue of the Code.  He, not Shamash, established
order and equity throughout the land.  Moses, in contrast, is
only an instrument.  The legislation is, &quot;thus says the Lord.&quot;
<P>
5. The Two Codes differ in their morality:
<P>
 From the ethical and spiritual standpoint the Mosaic legislation,
as would be expected, offers a considerable advance over the Babylonian
code.  For instance, Hammurappi's laws name at least ten varieties
of bodily mutilation for various offences.  If a doctor performs
an operation that is unsuccessful, his hand is to be cut off.
 There is, though, one instance of mutilation in the law of Moses:
Deut. 25:11-12.  In the Hebrew laws a greater value is generally
placed on human life, and the place of women is much better tan
in the rest of the ANE, or even the present Near East (under Islam).
 Slaves are treated amazingly better than in any other Near Eastern
country.  Moreover, the Babylonian code has nothng in it corresponding
to the twofold golden thread running through the Mosaic legislation:
love God and love your neighbor (Mat. 22:37-40).
<P>
 It can be summarized this way (thanks to Alfred Jeremias):
<P>
 a. There is no control of lust.
<P>
 b. There is no limitation on selfishness.
<P>
 3. There is nowhere to be found the postulate of charity.
<P>
 d. There is nowhere to be found the religious motif which recognizes
sin as the destruction of the people because it is in opposition
to the fear of God.  In the Hammurappi Code every trace of religious
thought is absent; behind the Iraelite law stands everywhere the
ruling will of God; the Mosaic legislation bears a religious character.
<P>
 In fact, this last point differentiates everything in the OT
from the rest of ANE literature and society: the monotheism and
the stress on love for God and love for neighbors.  This is absolutely
unique in world history. (There is nothing outside the Bible like
Deuteronomy 6:4-9, for instance).
<P>
Examples of Hammurrappi's laws:
<P>
21  If a man made a breach in a house, they shall put him to death
in front of that breach and wall him in.
<P>
25  If a fire broke out in a man's house and a man, who went to
extinguish it, cast his eye on the goods of the owner of the house
and has appropriated the goods of the owner of the house, that
man shall be thrown into the fire.
<P>
110  If a hierodule, a &quot;lady of a god&quot;, who is not living
in a temple, has opened the door of a wineshop or has entered
a wineshop for a drink, they shall burn that woman.
<P>
127  If a man pointed the finger at a &quot;lady of a god&quot;
or the wife of another man, but has proved nothing, they shall
drag that man into the presence of the judges and also cut off
half his hair.
<P>
129 If the wife of a man has been caught while lying with another
man, they hsall bind them and throw them into the water.  If the
husband of the woman wishes to spare his wife, then the kig in
turn may spare his subject.
<P>
132 (cf. Num. 5:11-31) If a finger was pointe at the wife of a
man because of another man, but she has not been caught while
lying with the other man, she shall throw herself into the river
for the sake of the husband. (the word River has the determinitive
for deity, indicating that the river -- the Euphrates-- was being
called upon to act as a judge).
<P>
192 If the adopted son of a chamberlain or the adopted son of
a votary has said to his foster father or his foster mother, &quot;You
are not my father,&quot; &quot;You are not my mother&quot;, they
shall cut out his tongue.
<P>
193  If the adopted son of a chamberlain or the adopted son of
a votary found out his parentage and came to hate his foster father
and his foster mother and so has gone off to his paternal home,
they shall pluck out his eye.
<P>
<B>Deuteronomy</B>
<P>
<I><B>Authorship</B></I>
<P>
 Probably upon no other book of the Bible have the discoveries
of archeology been so helpful.  The recovery of certain texts
of the ANE have helped us gain a full understanding of the book
of Deuteronomy, an understanding which had been forgotten.
<P>
 The traditional view concerning the Mosaic authorship of Deuteronomy
had as a corollary the understanding that the book was a unified
literary whole.  In recent scholarship, however, it is commonly
held that the unity of the book marks a late stage of its development
and that it may be possible to discern the component parts that
underlie the formal unity.  In general terms, there are two reasons
for this kind of approach to the study of the unity of the work:
<P>
1. If Deuteronomy, as a finished work, is believed to be essentially
a product of the 7th century BC, then it is natural to attempt
to discern older material which might have been incorporated in
the work during the 7th century.
<P>
2. There are, in the view of most scholars, internal clues which
might provide a means of discerning different strands in the composition
of the book.  The evidence employed might consist of data such
as the following:
<P>
 a. the duplication of headings or introductions (e.g. 1:1, 4:44ff,
6:1, and 12:1)
<P>
 b. the alternation in the use of number (2nd sing/plur) in verbs
and pronouns
<P>
 c. various types of literary analysis (e.g., form-critical studies
of particular passages within the book).
<P>
 The first reason, above, is clearly the primary one in significance,
for if an argument is made for the antiquity of the book, then
the second reason (internal evidence) appears in a somewhat different
perspective.
<P>
 The analysis of the internal textual material has been undertaken
in recent years (the last 100 or so) by means of form-criticism,
with the current emphasis turning toward redaction-criticism.
 This last method, redaction-criticism, is in principle more positive,
but it presupposes to a large extent the work of earlier analysis
and reflects the view that Deuternomy is not a product of the
period it describes.
<P>
 There have continued to be a number of scholars who, for a variety
of reasons, have argued for the essential unity of Detuernomy
as a whole.  They have been a minority, and the differences they
have maintained against a growing consensus have been based, to
a large extent, on a very positive assessment of the early (Mosaic)
period of Israelite religion.  Given a positive assessment of
the early period of Israel's history, the radical doubt of the
authenticity of Deuteronomy in its early setting is to a large
extent removed
<P>
(current biblical scholarship, as one part of Western thought,
has as its working principle radical doubt, which probably finds
its roots in the epistemology of Descartes.  Epsitemology deals
with theories of knowledge -- how we know that we know -- examining
the degrees of certainty and probability in knowledge and the
difference between knowing with certainty and believing without
being certain.    In modern thought, the two main competing epistemological
orientations are: rationalism (Descartes), which stresses the
role of reason in providing certainty, and empiricism, which stresses
the sense of perception.  These two schools are not necessarily
mutually exclusive) .
<P>
<I><B>Treaty Format</B></I>
<P>
 In the last two or three decades, however, there has been an
important new direction in OT research, which is of great significance
for the study of Deuteronomy.  A number of scholars have argued
convincingly that there is a relationship in form between the
Hebrew covenant and the ANE vassal treaty (see G.E. Mendenhall,
K. Baltzer, and D.J. McCarthy, along with M.G. Kline, K.A. Kitchen,
J.B. Payne and J.A. Thompson).  The thesis was applied initially
to tets describing the formation of the covenant at Sinai and
also to various passages describing the renewal of the covenant
(e.g. Josh. 24).  Subsequently, the insights of this new thesis
were applied to Deuteronomy, initially with reference to particular
passages within the book (e.g., 4 and 28), but then on a larger
scale which encompassed virtually the entire book.  Among the
first to apply this approach to all of Deuteronomy were M.G. Kline
and K.A. Kitchen.
<P>
 1. In its classical form, the ANE vassal treaty has the following
component parts:
<P>
 1. Preamble (&quot;These are the words...&quot;)
<P>
 2. Historical Prologue (antecendent history: events leading to
and forming the basis of the treaty.  Explains why we're here)
<P>
 3. General Stipulations (statement of substance concerning the
future relationship, which a) is intimately related to the antecedent
history, and b) summarizes the purpose of the specific stipulations).
<P>
 4. Specific Stipulations
<P>
 5. Divine Witnesses (various deities are calle to witness the
treaty)
<P>
 6. Blessings and cursings (relating respectively to the maintenance
or breach of the covenant).
<P>
 There are, in addition, a number of otehr sections in certain
texts which deal with the deposition of the treaty, its public
reading, ceremonies of oath, and various formal procedures.
<P>
 The vassal treaty was employed within the ANE when a great power
(the suzerain king) imposed certain conditions of vassaldom on
a smaller state (the vassal), which would normally have been conquered
by the more powerful state in battle.  The treaty explained the
reasons for imposition and the nature of the conditions imposed
on the smaller state, and made certain provisions relating to
the maintenance of the treaty.  The same basic type of treaty
seems to have been employed throughout the Near East, and there
is evidence of its use, in simpler form, in Mesopotamia as early
as the 3rd millenium.  In Egypt, there is some evidence to suggest
that the treaty form was employed not only in relation to external
vassal states, but also in relation to foreign labor groups within
Egypt.
<P>
 2. The Hebrews adapted the treaty form for their own use in order
to express the nature of their relationship to God.  For many
years they were in effect vassals to Egypt, but that old bondage
was brought to an nd in the Exodus from Egypt.  Being liberated
from bondage to an earthly power, they then submitted themselves
in the Sinai Covenant to become vassals of God, the one who had
liberated them from Egypt.  The nature of this new submission,
expressed in the covenant, finds its dramatic expression through
the utilization and adaptation of the treaty form.  While other
small states might serve Egypt or the Hittite Empire as vassals,
the Israelites owed tehir allegiance only to their suzerain God.
 This treaty form, in which their covenant was set, finds striking
expression in the book of Deuteronomy as a whole: in brought outline,
the treaty form of the book may be described as follows:
<P>
 
<P>
 1. Preamble (1:1-5) &quot;These are the words which Moses addressed
to all Israel...)
<P>
 2. Historical Prologue (1:6-4:49)
<P>
 3. General Stipulations (5-11)
<P>
 4. Specific Stipulations (12-26)
<P>
 5. Blessings and Cursings (27-28)
<P>
 6. Witnesses (see 30:19, 31:19, 32:1-43)
<P>
 The last two points can be expressed more broadly to encompass
the whole work:
<P>
 
<P>
 5. Cursings and Blessings, with exhortation (27-30)
<P>
 6. Provisions for the continuity of the covenant and a successor
for Moses (31-32)
<P>
 This overall structure of the book of Deuteronomy suggests that
it can be regarded essentially as a unity. The book is thus a
literary account of the renewal of the covenant with God on the
plains of Moab.  The literary (treaty) pattern may be more than
merely a literary device; it is possible it reflects also the
ceremony during which the covenant was renewed and a sucessor
to Moses was appointed.
<P>
 The covenant at Sinai was not a once-and-for-all event that had
only historical significance.  It inaugurated a continuing relationship
(which had already been anticipated in the earlier covenants)
between God and his people; because it was a continuing relationship,
the covenant was to be renewed regularly, but in each renewal
the event at Sinai was recalled.  The renewal of the covenant
was undertaken, not because God changed, but because each generation
had to recommit itself regularly in love and obedience to the
Lord of the covenant.  In the address of Moses, the most powerful
exhortation is used to move the people to new and wholehearted
commitment to God.  The tendency to view the covenant as a legal
contract automatically binding man to God had to be countered;
the nature of the covenant, as an expression of a living relationship,
demanded of people not a legalistic acquienscence, but a loving
commitment to God.
<P>
 The treaty structure of the covenant was a reminder to the people
of their liberty in this world and of their total commitment to
God.  They had been in bondage, vassals to the worldly power in
Egypt, but God's intervention in history at the Exodus had freed
the Israelites from that human vassaldom; in the encounter with
God at Horeb, they had submitted to a new vassaldom under God.
 In the old servitude, Israel had served a worldly master and
had no freedom to worship God (Ex. 8:1); in the new covenant,
Israel had freedom to worship God and was servant to no worldly
state.  The domination of Egypt had been exchanged for the Kingdom
of God (Exodus 15:18), who had broken the fetters of the old bondage.
